From The Chapters on Monastic Discipline The Chapter on the Rains Prologue A global summary of The Chapter on the Rains: Settling for the rains, food, Interrupting the rains, the five, Mirage, leaves, roots, sandals, Rains, and the four leathers.
Settling for the Rains A summary: Permission for settling for the rains, Udayana’s departure, and Seven-day leave For business.
Permission for Settling for the Rains The Blessed Buddha pledged to settle for the rains in Śrāvastī, in Prince Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park.
Meanwhile, monks traveled and made their way through the countryside during the rains.
When those monks who traveled and made their way through the countryside were not cautious, tīrthikas chastised, rebuked, and criticized the heedless and incautious monks, saying, “Sirs, the Śākyan ascetics are killers.
These men do not balk at, shy away from, or avoid killing, for they travel and wander the countryside during the rains.
When they travel and wander the countryside during the rains, they trample swarms of many tiny and minute creatures, thus depriving them of life.
Even swallow chicks seasonally cower in their nests for the four rainy months.
Cowering, they cringe and stay curled up.
And if these shaven-headed ascetics do not understand even their basic pledges, who would give alms to them or even think to do so?”
The monks reported these events to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “Therefore, I consent: monks should pledge to settle for the rains.”
Since the monks did not know how to pledge to settle for the rains as the Blessed One had directed when he said that “monks should pledge to settle for the rains,” the Blessed One said, “On the fifteenth day of Āṣāḍha, sweep, sprinkle water over, and spread a fresh paste of dung over the temple floor.
All the bedding should be gathered together in a single place; do not conceal even small items such as foot-washing basins.
“Then a monk residence caretaker should be appointed.
For a residence caretaker, there are five factors that may pertain such that someone not already appointed should not be appointed, and if already appointed should be relieved of that position.
What are those five factors?
To be driven by desire, driven by aggression, driven by ignorance, driven by fear, and not to know which bedding has or has not been dispensed.
If those five factors do pertain to someone not already appointed as residence caretaker, he should not be appointed, and if already appointed should be relieved of that position.
“For a residence caretaker, there are five other factors that may pertain such that someone not already appointed should be appointed, and if already appointed should be relieved of that position.
What are these five factors?
Not to be driven by desire, driven by aggression, driven by ignorance, or driven by fear, and to know which bedding has or has not been dispensed.
If these five factors pertain to someone not already appointed as residence caretaker, he should be appointed, and if already appointed should not be relieved of that position.
“He should be appointed in the following way: After setting out seating, strike the gaṇḍī beam, and inform the monks of the matter at hand.
Once the entire saṅgha is seated and has a quorum, his willingness should be secured first: “ ‘Are you, so-and-so, willing to act as residence caretaker for the saṅgha during the rains?’
“He replies: “ ‘I am willing to do so.’
“One monk should then make a motion and then perform the act: “ ‘Honorable saṅgha, please listen.
This monk, so-and-so, is willing to act as residence caretaker for the saṅgha during the rains.
If the time is right and the saṅgha can accept it, I ask that the saṅgha give their permission.
Once the saṅgha appoints this monk to act as residence caretaker for the saṅgha during the rains, this residence caretaker so-and-so will become the residence caretaker for the saṅgha during the rains.’
“That is the motion.
The act should be performed in the following way: “ ‘Honorable saṅgha, please listen.
This monk residence caretaker, so-and-so, is willing to act as residence caretaker for the saṅgha during the rains.
Therefore, once so-and-so has been appointed as residence caretaker for the saṅgha, the residence caretaker so-and-so will act as residence caretaker for the saṅgha during the rains.
Those venerable ones who can accept the appointment of the monk so-and-so as the residence caretaker should remain silent.
Those who cannot accept it should speak now.’
“Once the saṅgha has accepted and given permission for the appointment, the saṅgha has appointed the monk so-and-so as the residence caretaker for the saṅgha.
By thus remaining silent, they assent to the proposed act.
“I will now formulate the rules of customary conduct for the monk residence caretaker: The monk residence caretaker should fashion for the saṅgha tally sticks that are not bent, crooked, or curved, and that are fragrant and pleasant to the touch.
After that, he should rise first in the morning and, having set out the seating, strike the gaṇḍī beam and inform the monks of the matter at hand.
Once the entire saṅgha is seated and has a quorum, the monk residence caretaker should anoint the tally sticks with fragrant water, place them on top of a white cloth laid out in a wicker box, and then place that at the end of the row of senior monks.
After that he should announce the rules: “ ‘Honorable saṅgha, please listen.
This and that are the rules adopted at this site.
Those among you venerable ones who are willing to pledge to settle for the rains according to these rules should take a tally stick.
No monk among you should prompt or remind a monk during the rains.
If any among you knows something, declare it now.
Let there be no prompting later, during the rains.
If any among you prompts during the rains, the saṅgha shall regard it as a matter to be considered later.’
“After that, the monk residence caretaker should distribute the tally sticks, allowing the teacher’s tally stick to be taken first.
After that, the saṅgha elders should rise partly from their seats, take a tally stick, and gently put it down.
This process is repeated by all down to the saṅgha’s new monks.
The novices’ tally sticks should be taken by their instructor or preceptor.
After that, those of the site caretakers should also be taken.
Then, once they have been counted, he should announce the total: “ ‘This many monks have taken tally sticks at this site.’
“After that, the monk residence caretaker, having taken up the locks and keys, should sit before the saṅgha elder and say: “ ‘Elder, such and such dwelling is furnished with goods and furnished with robes.
Please accept it.’
“If he accepts it, the saṅgha elder’s current dwelling should be given to the second eldest in the saṅgha, the dwelling of the second eldest in the saṅgha should be given to the third eldest, and so on down to the saṅgha’s new monks.
“If the saṅgha elder does not accept it, it should be given to the second eldest in the saṅgha.
If the second eldest in the saṅgha does not accept it, it should be given to the third eldest.
“If the saṅgha elder asks for it after the third eldest in the saṅgha has already accepted it, it should not be given to the elder at his first request, nor should it be given at his second request.
It should be given to him at his third request, in which case the saṅgha elder should confess to an offense of misdeed, a violation of the Vinaya.
“The same procedure should likewise be followed down to the new monks.
If the saṅgha’s third new monk should ask for dwelling after it has been accepted by a newer monk, it should not be given to him at his first request, nor should it be given at his second request.
It should be given to him at his third request, at which point the third new monk should confess to an offense of misdeed, a violation of the Vinaya.”
After the monks had allocated all the dwellings, some monks who were visitors were left without, so the Blessed One said, “One unallocated dwelling should be held aside for the sake of monks who visit.”
After the monks had allocated the gatehouse, the Blessed One said, “Gatehouses should not be allocated.”
After the hall had been allocated, the Blessed One said, “The hall should not be allocated.”
Crows, sparrows, and pigeons nested in the unoccupied halls, so the Blessed One said, “A monk should be appointed to remove the nests.
He should inspect the nests, and if no eggs have been left, they should be removed.
If eggs have been left, the nests should be left alone.”
Tryambuka and trailāṭaka flies built nests there, so the Blessed One said, “They should be inspected, and if no eggs have been left, the nests should be removed.
If eggs have been left, the nests should be tied up with string so that they do not proliferate.
“The bedding should then be allocated.
If there are a small number of items, each monk should be given one.
If there are a large number of items, they should be given two or three.”
Once, some items were so large that the older monks became weary and exhausted from cleaning them, so the Blessed One said, “Those should be given to those who have taken a support.
“Then, the monk residence caretaker should announce the rules: “ ‘No monk shall make use of the saṅgha’s bedding without a ground-spread, which should not be labeled with a name, nor should the ground-spread have patches or be thin.
If the material is thick, one layer is permissible; if it is thin, it should have two layers.
If any of you make use of the saṅgha’s bedding without authorization, the saṅgha shall regard it as a matter to be considered later.’
“The monk residence caretaker should inspect the saṅgha’s bedding every fortnight.
If he sees an older monk using the saṅgha’s bedding without authorization, he should inform the saṅgha and then gather it up.
If he sees a newer monk doing so, he should inform the newer monk’s preceptor or instructor and then gather it up.
“Then, after all have assembled, he should announce the following: “ ‘Tomorrow, the saṅgha will pledge to settle for the rains with so-and-so acting as patron, so-and-so acting as caretaker, and such and such a village serving as alms circuit.’
“The monks should then inspect the site and the locale and, after entering seclusion, make the pledge to settle for the rains.
“How should the site be inspected?
By considering, ‘Will there be suffering and distress for the learned fellow brahmacārins, who have not yet experienced suffering and distress at this site?
If there is, will they be able to quickly pacify it?
Will there be ease and joy for those who have not yet experienced them?
If there is, will they be able to guard against ease and joy? Will there be someone to nurse us if we fall sick?’
“How should the alms circuit be inspected?
By considering, ‘Will there be alms givers in the village on this alms circuit?
Will there be someone to nurse those who fall sick, and to provide them with medicine?’
“Then, having entered seclusion, the monk residence caretaker should respectfully squat in front of the most senior monk and, with palms pressed together, say: “ ‘Honorable one, please give me your attention.
Today is the commencement of the saṅgha’s rains retreat, the sixteenth day of Āṣāḍha.
Today is also the commencement of my, the monk so-and-so’s, rains retreat, the sixteenth day of Āṣāḍha.
I pledge to settle for the three earlier months of rains at this site within these demarcated boundaries with the patron so-and-so, the caretaker so-and-so, and such and such a village as alms circuit for the repair of any breaks or deteriorations at the site.
My rains retreat will be here. This will be my rains retreat site.’
“That is repeated a second and a third time.
This is how monks should make the pledge to settle for the rains.
A monk who has pledged to settle for the rains should not go beyond the boundary.
If he does, he should not remain there.”
Udayana’s Departure The Blessed One had said, “A monk who has pledged to settle for the rains should not go beyond the boundary.
If he does, he should not remain there.” After that, in the town of Hastibāla there lived a householder named Udayana.
Having taken into his house a wife who would serve as his consort, he gathered much cloth and much food and sent a messenger to the monks, saying, “Noble ones!
Come, I will give you sustenance.”
The monks asked, “How far is the town of Hastibāla?”
“It is about three furlongs.”
Wondering whether they could make the round trip if they were to go that very day, they thought about the Blessed One’s statement, “A monk who has pledged to settle for the rains should not go beyond the boundary.
If he does, he should not remain there,” and did not go.
Udayana then offered much cloth and much food to those monks who had pledged to settle for the rains in the vicinity of the town of Hastibāla.
After the three months of the rains had passed, they, with their robes mended and in order, took up their begging bowls and robes and set off on the journey to Śrāvastī, until, after traveling by stages, they arrived there.
When the resident monks saw them approaching off in the distance, they called out, “Welcome, venerable ones, welcome!”
Once the visiting monks had been allowed to rest, the others asked, “Venerable ones, where have you come from just now?
Where did you pledge to settle for the rains?”
“Venerable ones, we have just now come here from the town of Hastibāla, where we pledged to settle for the rains.”
“Venerable ones, were you at ease pledging to settle for the rains there?
Were you not wearied by seeking alms?”
“Venerable ones, it was so; we were at ease pledging to settle for the rains and were not wearied by seeking alms in the town of Hastibāla.”
“Venerable ones, how is it that you were at ease pledging to settle for the rains and were not wearied by seeking alms in the town of Hastibāla?”
“Venerable ones, in the town of Hastibāla there lives a householder named Udayana.
Having taken into his house a wife who would serve as his consort, he offered much cloth and much food.
Thus it was, venerable ones, that we were at ease pledging to settle for the rains and were not wearied by seeking alms in the town of Hastibāla.”
They said, “Venerable ones, that householder also sent us a messenger with the message, ‘Noble ones! Come, I will give you sustenance.’
When we asked how far the town of Hastibāla was, we were told it was just over three furlongs.
Then we thought of the Blessed One’s statement, ‘A monk who has pledged to settle for the rains should not go beyond the boundary.
If he does, he should not remain there,’ and did not go.”
The monks informed the Blessed One of this matter and the Blessed One thought, “Ah!
My disciples desire goods of cloth and food, so I will permit them a leave of seven days so that the monks may settle at ease and partake of the donations made by patrons.”
Then the Blessed One said, “Therefore, I consent: once excused, monks may leave for up to seven days on account of business.”
Seven-Day Leave on Account of Business When the Blessed One said, “Therefore, I consent: once excused, monks may leave for up to seven days on account of business,” the monks did not know what business the Blessed One intended so the monks asked the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “A male lay vow holder’s business, a female lay vow holder’s business, a monk’s business, a nun’s business, a nun postulant’s business, a male novice’s business, and a female novice’s business.

Interrupting the Rains A summary: No offense for interrupting the rains, Those who pledge to settle, and The twelve for the earlier and The twelve for the later.
No Offense for Interrupting the Rains “A monk who has pledged to settle for the rains might see another monk communicating with, informing, coaching, and recruiting other monks, working to create a schism among the saṅgha.
Knowing about this, he might think, ‘There is a potential for a schism in the saṅgha at this site during the rains.’

There is a potential for a schism in the saṅgha at this site during the rains.
If I settle for the rains at this site and hostile feelings develop or unconsidered words are used, it will be a hindrance to my achieving what I have not yet achieved, realizing what I have not yet realized, and actualizing what I have not yet actualized, so I should leave this site.’
“There is no offense if he interrupts the rains on account of such conditions.
“A monk who has pledged to settle for the rains might hear that in another monastery a monk is communicating with, informing, coaching, and recruiting other monks, working to create a schism among the saṅgha, and that there is a potential for a schism in the saṅgha at this site during the rains.
If he thinks, ‘This monk is an acquaintance, friend, intimate, and companion, so I could prevent a schism in the saṅgha at that site during the rains if I went,’ the monk, once excused, may leave for up to seven days to attend to saṅgha business.
It is well if he goes.
He will be guilty of a breach if he does not.
There will be no offense of interrupting the rains if seven days pass while he is tending to saṅgha business.

Those Who Pledge to Settle “After pledging to settle for the earlier three rainy months at a particular site, which is one of two that share provisions but perform the restoration rite separately, a monk might think, ‘Whether I live here or there, the provisions will run out.’
If he does not make a pledge, his does not count as the earlier three rainy months at that site and he is guilty of a misdeed because of his pledge.

“There will be no offense of interrupting the rains if after seven days pass while he is tending to saṅgha business.”
The Twelve for Earlier and the Twelve for Later “Just as there are six permutations in which a monk tends to some business, there are also six in which he does not.
Just as there is an earlier part of the three months, there is also a later part of the three months.”
This marks the end of “The Chapter on the Rains.”
