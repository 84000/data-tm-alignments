The Two Stanza Dhāraṇī Homage to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta.
Contempt toward the Buddha and the Dharma, Laziness, contentment with small amounts, Acting with desire and pride, Regret, and parting due to being uncertain— Such are beings’ obscurations.
The antidote is the teaching of the supreme vehicle Through which all the faults That cause hindrances are abandoned.
tadyathā | oṃ vajra­prakāra vajra­prakāra | vajra­cakra daṃṣṭrābhayānake| amale vimale | nirmale | culuke culuke| culu culu | sarva­buddhe svāhā || Whoever practices The Two Stanza Dhāraṇī, With respect to either the words or the meaning, Is a wise sublime being Who will attain ten benefits— Complete development of the elements, Perfect joy at the moment of death, Rebirth according to one’s wish, Total recollection of former lives, Meeting with buddhas, Hearing the supreme vehicle from them, Interest, along with intellect, The two gates, and swift awakening.
Thus ends “The Two Stanza Dhāraṇī.”
