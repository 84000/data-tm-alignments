The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra Dispelling the Darkness of the Ten Directions
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time.
The Blessed One was dwelling among the Śākyas at Nyagrodha Park in Kapilavastu, together with a great assembly of 1,250 monks and a great retinue of bodhisattvas including Maitreya and Mañjuśrī.
In the morning the Blessed One put on his lower robe and, taking up his alms bowl and upper dharma robe, surrounded and escorted by an assembly of monks, traveled to the great city of Kapilavastu to receive alms.
At that time, a Śākya youth known as Shining Countenance was setting out from the great city of Kapilavastu in a chariot to attend to some affairs.
Even from a great distance, the Śākya youth Shining Countenance saw the Blessed One approach.
Seeing him, he dismounted from the chariot and went to where the Blessed One was, bowed with palms joined in the direction of the Blessed One, and bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet.
He then circumambulated the Blessed One three times, and with palms joined sat before the Blessed One.
The Śākya youth Shining Countenance then made this request of the Blessed One: “Blessed One, here in this city both my father and mother, while they are asleep or awake, might be harmed by nonhuman beings.
Blessed One, I, too, when traveling to other lands, might be harmed by bandits or wild animals.
Therefore, may the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, out of compassion for me and by any means, protect me so that human and nonhuman beings and those in the animal realm do not harm me.
Please teach a rite of protection.”
The Blessed One replied to the Śākya youth Shining Countenance, “Young man, listen carefully then and keep this in mind.
I will instruct you.”
“Blessed One, please do so,” requested the Śākya youth Shining Countenance, and he listened to the Blessed One.
The Blessed One said, “Young man, in the eastern direction, eighty thousand buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Shaking All Defilements.
There the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Follower presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, when you set out in the eastern direction to attend to some affairs, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If you bring this clearly to mind and then depart, you will have no fear.
If you hold this in your mind without distraction during that time, you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke the following verse:
“Thoroughly honoring the lord, The completely perfect Buddha, the great sage,
If you maintain this clearly and then depart,
You will have no fear.
“Young man, in the southern direction, ninety thousand buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Dispelling the Mass of Dense Darkness.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as King Who Is Superior Due to Freedom from Fear and Timidity in Any Activity Since First Generating the Mind of Awakening presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, when you set out in the southern direction to attend to some affairs, at that time, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If you bring this clearly to mind and then depart while remaining undistracted, free of thoughts of home and so forth, you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked, and you will not fear anything.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke the following verse:
“Freed from obsession With thoughts of home,
When you travel south
You will experience no fear.
“Young man, in the western direction, as many buddha fields beyond this buddha field as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, there is a world system known as Reaching One’s Goal.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Subjugator of Resentment and Conceit presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, when you set out in the western direction to attend to some affairs, at that time, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If you bring this clearly to mind and then depart without defilements, undistracted, and with mindfulness, you will not fear anything.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“There are no phenomena that arise,
Nor are there any that cease.
Those who understand phenomena thus
Have no fear whatsoever.
“Young man, in the northern direction, ten billion buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Possessing a Buddha’s Eloquence.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Overpowering with the Light of an Array of the Reflections of Jewels presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, when you set out in the northern direction to attend to some affairs, at that time, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If you bring this clearly to mind and then depart while remaining undistracted, you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked, and you will not fear anything.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“Always make the mind equal Toward all sentient beings.
If you do not disrespect any sentient being,
You will experience no fear.
“Young man, in the northeastern direction, eighty thousand buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Conquered the Legions of Māra.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Māras and Doubt Conquered and Subdued presently resides, alive and well.
That thus-gone one, by merely sitting under the Bodhi tree, made it so all the gods of the māra class that exist in that trichiliocosm would not regress from unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening.
Young man, such was the heroic effort of that thus-gone one in sitting beneath the Bodhi tree.
Young man, when you set out in the northeastern direction to attend to some affairs, at that time, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If you bring this clearly to mind and then depart without distraction, you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked, and you will not fear anything.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“If you travel while keeping in mind
The Buddha who defeated the māras
With his very first thought,
You will have no fear.
“Young man, in the southeastern direction, twenty thousand buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Ever Radiant.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Glory of the Arising of the Irreversible Wheel Since First Generating the Mind of Awakening presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, that thus-gone one, from the moment of generating the first thought of awakening until attaining buddhahood, continually performed acts of generosity, guarded his moral discipline, assiduously practiced patience, exerted himself in diligence, established concentration, and practiced wisdom.
Young man, such was the heroic effort of that thus-gone one.
Young man, when you set out in the southeastern direction to attend to some affairs, prostrate with your five limbs and then depart from your home.
Later you will not experience any regret and will not fear anything.
If you remain undistracted, you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“Prostrate with the five limbs,
Then depart from home.
You will travel
Without being overpowered by bandits.
“Young man, in the southwestern direction, thirty thousand buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Covered by a Golden Net.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Superior Illumination of a Jeweled Canopy presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, when you set out in the southwestern direction to attend to some affairs, at that time, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If you bring this clearly to mind and then depart while remaining undistracted, you will not fear anything, and you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“Having paid homage to the perfect Buddha,
Strew some flower petals.
When you travel to the southwest,
You will not experience fear.
“Young man, in the northwestern direction, as many buddha fields beyond this buddha field as there are grains of sand in six Ganges Rivers, there is a world system known as Purified, Steadfast, and Exalted.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Tamer of Bodhisattvas presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, that thus-gone one’s buddha field is without impurity, without sexual intercourse, without women, without thorns, pebbles, and gravel, and without the five degenerations.
Young man, when you set out in the northwestern direction to attend to some affairs, having first correctly observed pure conduct, depart from home with an undistracted mind.
Young man, you will accomplish the purpose for which you embarked, and you will not fear anything.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“Having first correctly observed pure conduct,
Depart from home.
Wherever you travel,
You will not be overpowered by bandits.
“Young man, in the direction of the zenith, as many buddha fields beyond this buddha field as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, there is a world system known as Possessing Nonreferential Application of Mind.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Exalted King of Meditative Concentration Fearless and Free from Darkness presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, pay homage to that thus-gone one, remembering and honoring him.
If, whether sitting or standing, you pervade all beings with loving kindness and then perfect and maintain it, you will not fear anything.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“Keeping the mind undistracted,
Always remember that victorious one;
Always develop the mind of loving kindness,
And you will not experience fear.
“Young man, in the direction of the nadir, ninety-two thousand buddha fields beyond this buddha field, there is a world system known as Adorned with All Qualities.
There, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha known as Cutting Doubt and Shaking the Defilements Since First Generating the Mind of Awakening presently resides, alive and well.
Young man, at the commencement of all actions and during all activities, whether you are standing, sitting, or moving about, pay homage to that thus-gone one, keep him in mind, and establish the mind of loving kindness for beings and the beneficent mind.
Young man, you will not experience fear, and all your needs will be effortlessly accomplished.”
Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke this verse:
“In every activity, day and night,
Remember that buddha
And do not relinquish the mind of awakening,
And you will experience no fear.
“Young man, apprehend well the names of those thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas.
Keep them well and comprehend them well, and you will not experience any of those fears, anxieties, and terrors.” Thus spoke the Blessed One to the youth.
The Śākya youth Shining Countenance then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will apprehend the names of those thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas.
For me, Blessed One, there is no darkness whatsoever in those world systems.
Blessed One, I see those world systems and those thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas, just as I now see the Thus-Gone One teaching the Dharma to the assemblies.”
Then, from among that gathering, the Śākya youth Shining Countenance and the others, the great host of beings, looked upon the Blessed One, paid homage, made offerings, and attended upon him.
Each of the thousand living beings who had assembled there to listen to this Dharma discourse then rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, knelt on their right knees, bowed toward the Blessed One with palms joined, and spoke these words to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, because the Thus-Gone One taught this Dharma discourse for our benefit, for us, Blessed One, those directions and those world systems appear without darkness.
Blessed One, those world systems and those blessed buddhas appear just like the Thus-Gone One teaching the Dharma right now.”
Then, by the power of the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, bowed toward the Blessed One with palms joined, and spoke these words to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, when you taught this Dharma discourse to those noble sons and daughters, having heard the names of those blessed buddhas, their eyes were purified, and they saw all the world systems in the ten directions and all those blessed buddhas.
Blessed One, what is the merit by which they saw that and by which their eyes were purified?
Will there still be fruit when they transmigrate to another life?
Or will there not be?”
“Śāriputra,” replied the Blessed One, “noble sons and daughters who have correctly entered the Bodhisattva Vehicle and whose eyes have been purified in this way will become exceedingly pure in accordance with their lack of obscurations.
Śāriputra, do you see all thousand of these living beings?
Each and every one of them, Śāriputra, because of the root of virtue of apprehending the names of these buddhas, will attain the life of a universal emperor as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River.
In their last life and last body, all these beings will perfect all the accumulations of awakening.
In a single eon, every one of them will truly and completely awaken to unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening, all with the name of the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Ornamented with Pure Eyes.”
As soon as the Blessed One had given his prophecy to those noble sons and daughters, the trichiliocosm shook in six ways: it quaked, quaked deeply, and quaked violently;
it shook, shook deeply, and shook violently;
and it clamored, clamored deeply, and clamored violently.
Even the gods who move above the earth proclaimed, “Friends! It is amazing that by merely apprehending the names of these thus-gone ones these noble sons and daughters will have taken hold of unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening and become thus-gone ones who have understood everything through knowing all phenomena just as they are.
Who would not then develop faith in the Buddha?”
Having heard the cry of the gods who move above the earth, the gods belonging to the class of the Four Great Kings, those of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, those of the Heaven Free from Strife, those of the Heaven of Joy, those of the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, those of the māra class who reside in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, those of the Brahmā Heaven, those of the Heaven of the High Priests of Brahmā, and those of the Heaven of Great Brahmā, up to the gods of the Unexcelled Heaven, were delighted and overjoyed.
Having become joyful and happy, they cried, “Friends!
It is amazing that in this way, by merely apprehending the names of these thus-gone ones, these noble sons and daughters will have taken hold of unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening and become thus-gone ones who have understood everything through knowing all phenomena just as they are.
Who would not then develop faith in the Buddha?”
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, any noble sons or daughters having correctly entered the Bodhisattva Vehicle who hear this Dharma discourse and then remember it, uphold it, read it, master it, correctly teach it widely to others, or even so much as write it down and keep it with them—those noble sons or daughters are blessed by the Buddha.
Regard them as having served previous victorious ones.
Regard them as those who will not fear death.
They will not die in a state of distress.
They will not die from the harms of others.
Trust that they will not experience fear of water, bandits, poison, or weapons.”
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, the protector of the bodhisattva great beings, having heard such a prophecy as this, in order to maintain this Dharma discourse, went to where the Blessed One was, surrounded and escorted by a full thousand gods.
After bowing his head to the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulating the Blessed One three times, he strewed divine sandalwood powder, divine mandārava flowers, and great mandārava flowers toward the Blessed One and all the thousand living beings who had been prophesied by the Blessed One to attain unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening in the future.
Then, with his palms joined, he sat to one side and spoke these words:
“Blessed One, I will protect any noble sons and daughters who remember this Dharma discourse and who uphold it, read it, and master it.
Blessed One, whether those noble sons and daughters are in a house, in a monastery, under a tree, in an empty house, in the remote wilderness, on a path, or astray of a path, whether they are asleep or awakened from sleep, I will protect them so that they will not perish from the harms of others.”
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, even if some noble sons and daughters were to offer robes, alms, accommodations, medicines for illness, and other necessities throughout the entire life of the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha who presently dwells here, alive and well, that alone, Ānanda, would not be paying respect to the Thus-Gone One.
It would not be honoring him, it would not be venerating him, and it would not be offering to him.
If any noble sons and daughters who have correctly entered the Bodhisattva Vehicle hear this Dharma discourse and then remember it, uphold it, read it, master it, correctly teach it widely to others, or even so much as write it down and keep it with them, by merely that, Ānanda—through that supreme paying of respect to the Thus-Gone One, that supreme honoring of him, that supreme veneration of him, and that supreme offering to him—it is paying respect to him, honoring him, venerating him, and offering to him.”
Then the venerable Ānanda rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, bowed toward the Blessed One with palms joined, and spoke these words to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma discourse?
How should we remember it?”
The Blessed One then replied to the venerable Ānanda, “In this case, Ānanda, remember this Dharma discourse as Dispelling the Darkness of the Ten Directions.
Remember it also as Reciting the Names of the Thus-Gone Ones, as Realization of Insubstantiality, and as Realization of the Lack of Characteristics.”
The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Ānanda, the venerable Śāriputra, the Śākya youth Shining Countenance, all thousand living beings, the lord of gods Śakra, those monks and bodhisattvas, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.
This completes the noble Mahāyāna sūtra “Dispelling the Darkness of the Ten Directions.”
