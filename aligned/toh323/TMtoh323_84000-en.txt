The Single Stanza 
Homage to the Three Jewels!
Foremost among humans, there is no other great ascetic like you, Neither in the heavenly lands, in this world, in Vaiśravaṇa’s abode, In the excellent abodes of the gods’ palaces, nor in the cardinal and intermediate directions.
How could there be another one like you on this vast earth with its mountains and forests?
Thus ends “The Single Stanza.”
