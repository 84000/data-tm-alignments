The Sūtra of the Moon (1) 
Respectful homage to the noble Three Jewels!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī. At that time the god Candramas was seized by Rāhu, lord of the asuras. Then the god Candramas, recollecting and taking the Blessed One to heart, recited this verse:
“I bow to the heroic Buddha. May you swiftly liberate all beings! As I have come into confinement
I take refuge in you.”
Then the Blessed One, for the sake of the god Candramas, addressed Rāhu, lord of the asuras, with this verse: “Since buddhas have compassion for the world, Candramas took refuge In the Worthy One, the Tathāgata; Therefore, Rāhu, set the moon free!”
Thereupon Rāhu, lord of the asuras, set the god Candramas free and hurriedly approached Vemacitra, lord of the asuras. He then sat to one side, displeased, agitated, and with all his body hairs bristling. Vemacitra, lord of the asuras, now questioned Rāhu, lord of the asuras, in verse:
“Why, Rāhu, did you release The moon in such a fright?
You are a very miserable sight.
Why did you approach in fear?” 
Rāhu replied: “Had I, hearing the Buddha’s verse, Not then released the moon
My head would have split into seven pieces And my life would be without happiness.”
This concludes “The Sūtra of the Moon.”
