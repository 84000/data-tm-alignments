The Dhāraṇī “Dream Visions” 
Homage to the Three Jewels!
Homage to the great yakṣa general, the fierce Vajrapāṇi!
oṁ mucini svāhā | mukhese svāhā | mohani svāhā | dantiri svāhā This rite is as follows: One should incant a handful of water and drink it.
Then, when one falls asleep with intent, Vajrapāṇi will reveal a dream.
The Dhāraṇī “Dream Visions” is complete.
