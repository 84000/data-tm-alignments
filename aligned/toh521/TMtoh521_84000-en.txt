The Noble Essence of Dependent Arising 
Homage to the blessed Buddha!
“The Tathāgata explained the cause Of dharmas that arise from causes, And he taught their cessation.
Thus the Great Śramaṇa has instructed.
ye dharmā hetuprabhavā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hy avadat | teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃvādī mahāśramaṇaḥ || 
By reciting this essence once, all negative actions will be purified and all adverse conditions will be pacified and averted.
Any object that one envisions while reciting it will become the body of the Buddha or a stūpa, and any offering one envisions while reciting it will be offered as if they fill an entire world realm.
The Essence of Dependent Arising is complete.
