The Dhāraṇī of the Polished Gem 
Homage to the Three Jewels.
oṃ smara smara| vismanaskara mahājava hūṃ| 
Say this as a gem is polished.
Imagine that by doing this a boundless rain of jeweled parasols, banners, and the like fills the whole of the sky, and offer this.
This completes “The Dhāraṇī of the Polished Gem.”
