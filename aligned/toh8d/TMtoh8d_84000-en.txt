Chapter 14 Then as many Great Kings as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Śakras, mighty lords of the gods, as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Suyāma gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Saṃtuṣita gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Nirmāṇarati gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Paranirmitavaśavartin gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Mahābrahmā gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Ābhāsvara gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Śubhakṛtsna gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
As many Vṛhatphala gods as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
And as many gods in the realms of the Śuddhāvāsa as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.
Yet the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Yāma realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Tuṣita realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, and the radiance of the bodies of gods in the Śuddhāvāsa realms originating through the ripening of their past actions––all those radiances—did not approach a hundredth part, did not approach a thousandth part, did not approach a hundred thousandth part, did not approach even a hundred thousand ten million billionth part of the natural radiance of the Tathāgata; they did not stand up to any number, fraction, calculation, or example of it.
All those radiances of the gods, originating through the ripening of their past actions, neither sparkled, nor gleamed, nor shone alongside the radiance of the Tathāgata’s body.
The radiance of the Tathāgata’s body alone was the best among them.
It was foremost.
It was the greatest.
It was superior.
It was excellent.
It was supreme.
It was perfect.
It was unsurpassed, and it was unexcelled.
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm, the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm, and the gods in the Śuddhāvāsa realms, as many as there are, have come together wanting to hear the Dharma, in order to listen to specific instruction for coming to an authoritative conclusion about this exposition of the perfection of wisdom.
How then should bodhisattva great beings dwell in the perfection of wisdom?
What is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of wisdom?
How should bodhisattva great beings train in the perfection of wisdom?”
The venerable Subhūti then replied to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, you should therefore listen carefully and pay attention.
Through the power of the buddhas, and through the blessings of the buddhas, I will explain to the bodhisattva great beings the perfection of wisdom, how bodhisattva great beings should dwell in and train in the perfection of wisdom, and that those gods who have not yet set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment should also set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
As for those who have entered into perfect maturity, they are not able to set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
If you ask why, it is because a boundary to the continuum of saṃsāra has been demarcated by them.
However, if they do set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, I rejoice in them as well.
Since attributes even more distinguished than the distinguished attributes are yet to be gained, I do not obstruct their virtues.
“Kauśika, in this regard, you might ask, ‘What is this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings?’

“Moreover, Kauśika, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they analytically train as follows: It is just those phenomena alone moistening, saturating, perfecting, augmenting, and considering phenomena in that way.
There is no ‘I’ or ‘mine’ in them.
If you ask why, it is because neither does that mind of a bodhisattva great being’s virtuous roots assist the mind set on enlightenment, nor does that mind set on enlightenment assist that mind of virtuous roots.
Neither does that mind set on enlightenment assist the mind that dedicates the virtuous roots, nor does that mind that dedicates assist the mind set on enlightenment.
“Kauśika, the mind of virtuous roots does not exist and is not apprehended in the mind set on enlightenment, and the mind set on enlightenment does not exist and is not apprehended in the mind of virtuous roots.
The mind set on enlightenment does not exist and is not apprehended in the mind that dedicates, and the mind that dedicates does not exist and is not apprehended in the mind set on enlightenment.
“Kauśika, that investigation of all phenomena in that manner that does not move toward anything is the perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings.”
The elder Subhūti having said this, Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, inquired of him, “Venerable monk Subhūti, in what way does the mind that dedicates not associate with the mind set on enlightenment?
In what way does the mind set on enlightenment not associate with the mind that dedicates? In what way is the mind that dedicates nonexistent and not apprehended in the mind set on enlightenment?
In what way is the mind set on enlightenment nonexistent and not apprehended in the mind that dedicates?”
“Kauśika,” replied Subhūti, “that which is the mind that dedicates is not-mind, and that which is the mind set on enlightenment is not the mind that dedicates.
Therefore, that which is not-mind is inconceivable, and that which is inconceivable is not-mind.
Not-mind does not dedicate to not-mind.
Nor does the inconceivable dedicate to the inconceivable.
Therefore, that which is not mind is inconceivable.
That which is inconceivable is not mind.
This, Kauśika, is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of wisdom.”
Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Subhūti, “Excellent, Subhūti, excellent!
The way, Subhūti, that you are teaching the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings and energizing them is excellent.”
“Blessed Lord, I should feel gratitude.
I should not not feel gratitude,” replied Subhūti.
“That is because when the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past were alive, those śrāvakas of that time taught and instructed, delighted, urged, encouraged, aroused, established, and absolutely secured the Tathāgata, Arhat, perfectly complete Buddha, when earlier in the form of a bodhisattva, in the six perfections, so that, having trained in the six perfections when earlier in the form of a bodhisattva, the Blessed Lord fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Similarly, Blessed Lord, I too should teach, should instruct, should delight, should urge, should encourage, should arouse, should establish, and should absolutely secure bodhisattva great beings in the six perfections.
Those bodhisattva great beings whom I have taught, instructed, delighted, urged, encouraged, aroused, established, and absolutely secured in the six perfections in that manner will also fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.”
The venerable Subhūti then said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, you should therefore listen carefully and keep this in mind.
I will explain how bodhisattva great beings should dwell and how they should not dwell in the perfection of wisdom.

Then the venerable Śāriputra thought, “Well then, how should bodhisattva great beings dwell in the perfection of wisdom?”
The venerable Subhūti, knowing in his mind the mental questioning of the venerable Śāradvatīputra, then asked the venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, do you think that the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas dwell on anything?”
“Venerable Subhūti,” he replied, “the tathāgatas do not dwell on anything at all.

and neither dwell nor do not dwell on knowledge of all the dharmas, neither dwell nor do not dwell on the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and neither dwell nor do not dwell on all-aspect omniscience.
They should dwell in the perfection of wisdom like that.
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings should train and dwell in the perfection of wisdom accordingly, without apprehending anything.”
This thought then occurred to some gods among the assembly: “The statements of the yakṣas, the language of the yakṣas, the words of the yakṣas, and the expressions of the yakṣas can be comprehended when spoken by the yakṣas, but the perfection of wisdom that the noble one Subhūti explains, speaks about, teaches, details, elucidates, and gives conclusive instructions about is incomprehensible.”
Then the venerable Subhūti, knowing in his mind the mental questioning of these gods, said to those gods, “Gods!
Is what has been said not understandable?
“Not understandable, noble Subhūti!”
affirmed the gods.
“Gods,” said Subhūti, “it is because not a single syllable is spoken, and that which is not spoken cannot be heard.
If you ask why, gods, it is because the perfection of wisdom is not syllables, so there is no teacher, no listener, and no one who understands.
If you ask why, gods, it is because the enlightenment of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas is without syllables.
Gods, as an analogy, suppose that a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha were to conjure an emanation of a buddha, and that emanation too were to conjure up the four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, and that emanation were to teach the Dharma to those four assemblies.
Do you think, gods, that there would be anyone teaching those assemblies, or anyone who would hear, or anyone who would understand?”
“There would not, venerable monk Subhūti,” they answered.
“Similarly, gods,” continued Subhūti, “all phenomena are like things that are conjured up.
There nothing is taught by anyone, heard by anyone, or known by anyone at all.
“Gods, as an analogy, suppose that a person who had fallen asleep were to see in a dream a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha, teaching the Dharma.
Do you think, gods, it was taught, heard, or understood there?”
“No, venerable monk Subhūti!”
they replied.
“Similarly, gods,” continued Subhūti, “all phenomena are like dreams.
There nothing is taught by anyone, heard by anyone, or known by anyone at all.
“Gods, as an analogy, suppose a pair of people standing in a ravine were to praise the Buddha, and praise the Dharma and the Saṅgha.
If echoes were to reverberate from those two, do you think, gods, that the first echo would have made the sound of the second echo known?” “No, venerable monk Subhūti!”
they replied.
“Similarly, gods,” continued Subhūti, “all phenomena are like echoes.
There nothing is taught by anyone, heard by anyone, or known by anyone at all.
“Gods, as an analogy, suppose that a clever magician or magician’s apprentice, standing at a major crossroads, were to conjure up a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha, and conjure up the four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, and that tathāgata were then to teach the Dharma to those four assemblies that had been conjured up.
Do you think, gods, that there would be anyone teaching or listening, or understanding there?”
“No, venerable monk Subhūti!”
they replied.
“Similarly, gods,” continued Subhūti, “all phenomena are like things that are made up.
There nothing is taught by anyone, heard by anyone, or known by anyone at all.”
Those gods then thought, “Oh!
This elder Subhūti is making it clear! Oh!
He is elucidating the perfection of wisdom!
But he is teaching the most profound of all.
He is entering into the most subtle of all.”
Then the venerable Subhūti, knowing in his mind the mental questioning of those gods, said to them, “Gods, physical forms are neither profound nor subtle, feelings are neither profound nor subtle, perceptions are neither profound nor subtle, formative predispositions are neither profound nor subtle, and consciousness is neither profound nor subtle.

The venerable Subhūti then said to those gods, “It is so, gods, it is so.
The enlightenment of the tathāgatas is inexpressible—it is not spoken about, it is not taught by anyone, it is not heard by anyone, and it is not known by anyone.
Therefore, gods, even if somebody wants to be a recipient of the fruit of having entered the stream and wants to actualize the fruit of having entered the stream, it is not possible without relying on this forbearance.
Even if somebody wants to be a recipient of the fruit of once-returner and wants to actualize the fruit of once-returner, it is not possible without relying on this forbearance.
Even if somebody wants to be a recipient of the result of non-returner and wants to actualize the result of non-returner, it is not possible without relying on this forbearance.
Even if somebody wants to be the recipient of arhatship and wants to actualize arhatship, it is not possible without relying on this forbearance.
Even if somebody wants to be the recipient of individual enlightenment and wants to actualize individual enlightenment, it is not possible without relying on this forbearance.
Even if somebody wants to be the recipient of unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment and wants to actualize unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, it is not possible without relying on this forbearance.
“In this way, gods, starting from when they first set their mind on enlightenment, bodhisattva great beings should abide in the perfection of wisdom based on its being neither spoken nor heard.”
This completes the fourteenth chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.”
Chapter 15 The gods then thought, “In what possible form should we accept those who hear the Dharma from the elder Subhūti to be?”
Then the venerable Subhūti, knowing in his mind the mental questioning of those gods, said to those gods, “Gods, you should accept that my Dharma teaching is like an illusion, and, gods, that those who listen to the Dharma from me are also like an illusion.
Gods, you should take my Dharma teaching as like a magical display, and, gods, you should accept that those who listen to the Dharma from me are also like a magical display.
They do not hear anything at all, nor do they actualize anything at all.”
The gods then asked the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, are those beings like an illusion, and are those who listen to the Dharma like an illusion?
Are those beings like a magical display, and are those who listen to the Dharma like a magical display?”
“It is so, gods, it is so,” replied Subhūti.

Then the gods asked the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, when you say that enlightenment is also like a dream, like an illusion, do you also say that nirvāṇa is like a dream, like an illusion?”
“Gods,” replied Subhūti, “I declare that nirvāṇa also is like a dream, like an illusion.
And even if there were anything else more sublime than nirvāṇa, that too, I say, would be like a dream, like an illusion.
If you ask why, gods, it is because being like a dream and being like an illusion, and nirvāṇa, are without duality and cannot be divided into two.”
Then the venerable Śāripūtra, the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, the venerable Mahākauṣṭhila, the venerable Mahākātyāyana, the venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, the venerable Mahākāśyapa, along with many thousands of bodhisattvas inquired of the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, who will have confidence in this perfection of wisdom, which is so profound, so hard to discern, so hard to realize, so peaceful, so clear, so subtle, and so sublime?”

If you ask why, it is because no Dharma at all is spoken about or explained in it.
Insofar as there is no Dharma at all that is spoken about or explained in it, there are no beings at all who will have confidence in it.”

“Are the ways bodhisattva great beings play with their extrasensory powers and miraculous abilities not also taught?
So then, is it not the case that bodhisattva great beings will practice the perfection of wisdom and take birth miraculously, or that they will have extrasensory powers that know no decline, or that they will go from buddhafield to buddhafield and their roots of virtue—those roots of virtue on account of which they will seek to serve, respect, honor, and worship those lord buddhas—will become complete?
Or is it not the case that the continuity of any Dharma that they will hear from those lord buddhas will never be interrupted, up until they have attained all-aspect omniscience, or that they will always be in a meditative absorption by way of being without distraction and without meditative absorption?
Or is it not the case that they will be endowed with a confidence that inspires speech that is unimpeded, inspires speech that is uninterrupted, inspires speech that is composed, inspires speech that is rational, inspires speech that is well connected, inspires speech that is purposeful, and inspires speech that is distinguished and elevated above the mundane?”

It is in that sort of way.”
The venerable Śāradvatīputra then asked the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable Subhūti, why in this perfection of wisdom, by way of not apprehending anything, are the three vehicles extensively taught?
Why is the mentor of bodhisattva great beings taught?
Why is there a teaching about the path of the bodhisattvas, from the first setting of the mind up to the tenth setting of the mind on enlightenment—that is to say, about the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; about the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; and about the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path, the four truths of the noble ones, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the five extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas?
Why are the ways bodhisattva great beings play with their extrasensory powers and miraculous abilities also taught, and therefore why will bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom and take birth miraculously, and their extrasensory powers know no decline?
Why will they go from buddhafield to buddhafield and their roots of virtue—those roots of virtue on account of which they will seek to serve, respect, honor, and worship those lord buddhas—become complete, and the continuity of any Dharma that they will hear from those lord buddhas never be interrupted up until they have attained all-aspect omniscience?
Why will they always be in a meditative absorption by way of being without distraction and without meditative absorption?
And why, by way of not apprehending anything, will they be endowed with a confidence that inspires speech that is unimpeded, inspires speech that is uninterrupted, inspires speech that is composed, inspires speech that is rational, inspires speech that is well connected, inspires speech that is purposeful, and inspires speech that is distinguished and elevated above the mundane?”

Chapter 16 Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, thought, “While the elder Subhūti is teaching this cascade of the Dharma in this manner, what if, in order to worship this perfection of wisdom, I were to conjure up flowers and sprinkle, scatter, and shower them upon the Lord Buddha, the bodhisattva great beings, the saṅgha of monks, and the elder Subhūti?”
Then all the gods in this billionfold world system––the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm; the gods of the Ābha realm, the gods of the Parīttābha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm; the gods of the Śubha realm, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm; the gods of the Vṛha realm, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm; and the gods of the Avṛha realm, the gods of the Atapa realm, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, the gods of the Sudarśana realm, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm, as many as there are––also thought, “While the elder Subhūti is teaching this cascade of the Dharma in this manner, what if, in order to worship this perfection of wisdom, I were to conjure up flowers and sprinkle, scatter, and shower them upon the Lord Buddha, the bodhisattva great beings, the saṅgha of monks, and the elder Subhūti.”
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, and all the gods in this billionfold world system––the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm; the gods of the Ābha realm, the gods of the Parīttābha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm; the gods of the Śubha realm, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm; the gods of the Vṛha realm, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm; and the gods of the Avṛha realm, the gods of the Atapa realm, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, the gods of the Sudarśana realm, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm––conjured up many divine mandārava flowers and, in order to worship this perfection of wisdom, sprinkled, scattered, and showered them upon the Lord Buddha, the bodhisattva great beings, the saṅgha of monks, and the elder Subhūti.
As soon as these flowers had been scattered, the ground of this billionfold world system was covered with flowers and a delightful and pleasing, towering mansion of flowers remained in the sky above, as large as this billionfold world system.
The elder Subhūti thought, “I have not previously seen even in all the abodes of the gods flowers like these that the gods have scattered.
These flowers have been conjured up.
Flowers like these that the gods have scattered do not come from trees, are not grown in water, and are not grown on the plains.
Flowers like these that the gods have scattered are mind-made, so these flowers do not come from trees.”
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the elder Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, these flowers have not originated, so these flowers are not mind-made and they do not come from trees.”
“Kauśika,” replied Subhūti, “you have said that these flowers are nonarising, so these flowers are not mind-made and they do not come from trees.
Kauśika, in that way they are nonarising and are not flowers.”

This being the case, this ‘being’ is designated as a name adventitiously, designated as a name in the absence of an entity, and designated as a name without an objective referent.”
Subhūti then asked, “Kauśika, do you think that in this perfection of wisdom there is anything that is explained as a ‘being’?”
“No, venerable monk Subhūti,” replied Śakra.
“Kauśika,” said Subhūti, “that being about which nothing at all has been explained is the being that is infinite.
Kauśika, if a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha, residing for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were to speak the words ‘a being,’ do you think, Kauśika, that any being would arise or cease there?”

No Dharma at all can be apprehended, nonetheless there has been a presentation of the three vehicles.
If you ask what the three are, they are the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, and the vehicle of the perfectly complete buddhas.”
Then the Blessed One said to the gods together with Indra, “Gods, it is so, it is just as you have said.
No Dharma at all can be apprehended, whether it be physical forms, or feelings, or perceptions, or formative predispositions, or consciousness; whether it be the eyes, or the ears, or the nose, or the tongue, or the body, or the mental faculty; whether it be sights, or sounds, or odors, or tastes, or tangibles, or mental phenomena; whether it be visual consciousness, or auditory consciousness, or olfactory consciousness, or gustatory consciousness, or tactile consciousness, or mental consciousness; whether it be visually compounded sensory contact, or aurally compounded sensory contact, or nasally compounded sensory contact, or lingually compounded sensory contact, or corporeally compounded sensory contact, or mentally compounded sensory contact; whether it be feelings conditioned by visually compounded sensory contact, or feelings conditioned by aurally compounded sensory contact, or feelings conditioned by nasally compounded sensory contact, or feelings conditioned by lingually compounded sensory contact, or feelings conditioned by corporeally compounded sensory contact, or feelings conditioned by mentally compounded sensory contact; whether it be the earth element, or the water element, or the fire element, or the wind element, or the space element, or the consciousness element; whether it be ignorance, or formative predispositions, or consciousness, or name and form, or the six sense fields, or sensory contact, or sensation, or craving, or grasping, or the rebirth process, or birth, or aging and death; whether it be the perfection of generosity, or the perfection of ethical discipline, or the perfection of tolerance, or the perfection of perseverance, or the perfection of meditative concentration, or the perfection of wisdom; whether it be the emptiness of internal phenomena, or the emptiness of external phenomena, or the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, or the emptiness of emptiness, or the emptiness of great extent, or the emptiness of ultimate reality, or the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, or the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, or the emptiness of the unlimited, or the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, or the emptiness of nonexclusion, or the emptiness of inherent nature, or the emptiness of all phenomena, or the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, or the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, or the emptiness of nonentities, or the emptiness of essential nature, or the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; whether it be the applications of mindfulness, or the correct exertions, or the supports for miraculous ability, or the faculties, or the powers, or the branches of enlightenment, or the noble eightfold path; or whether it be the truths of the noble ones, or the meditative concentrations, or the immeasurable attitudes, or the formless absorptions, or the liberations, or the serial steps of meditative absorption, or the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, or the extrasensory powers, or the meditative stabilities, or the dhāraṇī gateways, or the powers of the tathāgatas, or the fearlessnesses, or the kinds of exact knowledge, or great loving kindness, or great compassion, or the distinct qualities of the buddhas, or the fruit of having entered the stream, or the fruit of once-returner, or the fruit of non-returner, or arhatship, or individual enlightenment, or the knowledge of the aspects of the path, or all-aspect omniscience.
No Dharma at all can be apprehended, nonetheless there has been a presentation of the three vehicles.
If you ask what the three are, they are the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, and the vehicle of the perfectly complete buddhas.
“Gods, you should hold that bodhisattva great being who, by way of not apprehending anything, is not separated from this perfection of wisdom to be the tathāgata himself.
If you ask why, it is because the three vehicles are taught extensively in this perfection of wisdom.
If you ask what the three are, the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, and the vehicle of the perfectly complete buddhas are explained.
“The tathāgata cannot be apprehended as other than the perfection of generosity, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the perfection of ethical discipline, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the perfection of tolerance, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the perfection of perseverance, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the perfection of meditative concentration, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the perfection of wisdom; nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of internal phenomena, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of external phenomena, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of emptiness, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of great extent, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of ultimate reality, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of the unlimited, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of nonexclusion, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of inherent nature, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of all phenomena, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of nonentities, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of essential nature, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the applications of mindfulness, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the correct exertions, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the supports for miraculous ability, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the faculties, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the powers, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the branches of enlightenment, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the noble eightfold path; nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the truths of the noble ones, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the meditative concentrations, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the immeasurable attitudes, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the formless absorptions, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the liberations, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the serial steps of meditative absorption, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the extrasensory powers, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the meditative stabilities, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the dhāraṇī gateways, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the powers of the tathāgatas, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the fearlessnesses, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the kinds of exact knowledge, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than great loving kindness, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than great compassion, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the distinct qualities of the buddhas, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than knowledge of all the dharmas, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than the knowledge of the aspects of the path, nor can the tathāgata be apprehended as other than all-aspect omniscience.
“Gods, bodhisattva great beings train in all these attributes: They train in the perfection of generosity, train in the perfection of ethical discipline, train in the perfection of tolerance, train in the perfection of perseverance, train in the perfection of meditative concentration, and train in the perfection of wisdom; they train in the emptiness of internal phenomena, train in the emptiness of external phenomena, train in the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, train in the emptiness of emptiness, train in the emptiness of great extent, train in the emptiness of ultimate reality, train in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, train in the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, train in the emptiness of the unlimited, train in the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, train in the emptiness of nonexclusion, train in the emptiness of inherent nature, train in the emptiness of all phenomena, train in the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, train in the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, train in the emptiness of nonentities, train in the emptiness of essential nature, and train in the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; they train in the applications of mindfulness, train in the correct exertions, train in the supports for miraculous ability, train in the faculties, train in the powers, train in the branches of enlightenment, and train in the noble eightfold path; and they train in the truths of the noble ones, train in the meditative concentrations, train in the immeasurable attitudes, train in the formless absorptions, train in the liberations, train in the serial steps of meditative absorption, train in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, train in the extrasensory powers, train in the meditative stabilities, train in the dhāraṇī gateways, train in the powers of the tathāgatas, train in the fearlessnesses, train in the kinds of exact knowledge, train in great loving kindness, train in great compassion, train in the distinct qualities of the buddhas, train in the fruit of having entered the stream, train in the fruit of once-returner, train in the fruit of non-returner, train in arhatship, train in individual enlightenment, train in the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and train in all-aspect omniscience.
Gods, it is for that reason that a bodhisattva great being who practices without becoming separated from this perfection of wisdom is said to be the tathāgata himself.
“Gods, when I attended upon the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Dīpaṃkara, and was in the middle of the market in the capital city Padmāvatī, I was not separated from the perfection of generosity, was not separated from the perfection of ethical discipline, was not separated from the perfection of tolerance, was not separated from the perfection of perseverance, was not separated from the perfection of meditative concentration, and was not separated from the perfection of wisdom; I was not separated from the emptiness of internal phenomena, was not separated from the emptiness of external phenomena, was not separated from the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, was not separated from the emptiness of emptiness, was not separated from the emptiness of great extent, was not separated from the emptiness of ultimate reality, was not separated from the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, was not separated from the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, was not separated from the emptiness of the unlimited, was not separated from the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, was not separated from the emptiness of nonexclusion, was not separated from the emptiness of inherent nature, was not separated from the emptiness of all phenomena, was not separated from the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, was not separated from the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, was not separated from the emptiness of nonentities, was not separated from the emptiness of essential nature, and was not separated from the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; I was not separated from the applications of mindfulness, was not separated from the correct exertions, was not separated from the supports for miraculous ability, was not separated from the faculties, was not separated from the powers, was not separated from the branches of enlightenment, and was not separated from the noble eightfold path; and I was not separated from the truths of the noble ones, was not separated from the meditative concentrations, was not separated from the immeasurable attitudes, was not separated from the formless absorptions, was not separated from the liberations, was not separated from the serial steps of meditative absorption, was not separated from the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, was not separated from the extrasensory powers, was not separated from the meditative stabilities, was not separated from the dhāraṇī gateways, was not separated from the powers of the tathāgatas, was not separated from the fearlessnesses, was not separated from the kinds of exact knowledge, was not separated from great loving kindness, was not separated from great compassion, and was not separated from the distinct qualities of the buddhas.
Through not apprehending them, I was also not separated from the other immeasurable attributes of the buddhas.
“Gods, at that time, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Dīpaṃkara prophesied that I would attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, saying, ‘Young man, in the future, after countless eons, during the Auspicious Eon in this very world system you will become Śākyamuni, a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed steersman for individuals who are to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one.’ ”
Those gods then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, it is wonderful how the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of wisdom favorably sustains the bodhisattva great beings’ all-aspect omniscience through not acquiring or relinquishing physical forms, through not acquiring or relinquishing feelings, through not acquiring or relinquishing perceptions, through not acquiring or relinquishing formative predispositions, and through not acquiring or relinquishing consciousness;

When bodhisattva great beings exist, the paths of the ten virtuous actions will emerge in the world, the four meditative concentrations will emerge in the world, the four immeasurable attitudes will emerge in the world, the four formless absorptions will emerge in the world, and the five extrasensory powers will emerge in the world; the perfection of generosity will emerge in the world, the perfection of ethical discipline will emerge in the world, the perfection of tolerance will emerge in the world, the perfection of perseverance will emerge in the world, the perfection of meditative concentration will emerge in the world, and the perfection of wisdom will emerge in the world; the emptiness of internal phenomena will emerge in the world, the emptiness of external phenomena will emerge in the world, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena will emerge in the world, the emptiness of emptiness will emerge in the world, the emptiness of great extent will emerge in the world, the emptiness of ultimate reality will emerge in the world, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena will emerge in the world, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena will emerge in the world, the emptiness of the unlimited will emerge in the world, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end will emerge in the world, the emptiness of nonexclusion will emerge in the world, the emptiness of inherent nature will emerge in the world, the emptiness of all phenomena will emerge in the world, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics will emerge in the world, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended will emerge in the world, the emptiness of nonentities will emerge in the world, the emptiness of essential nature will emerge in the world, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities will emerge in the world; the four applications of mindfulness will emerge in the world, the four correct exertions will emerge in the world, the four supports for miraculous ability will emerge in the world, the five faculties will emerge in the world, the five powers will emerge in the world, the seven branches of enlightenment will emerge in the world, and the noble eightfold path will emerge in the world; and the four truths of the noble ones will emerge in the world, the eight liberations will emerge in the world, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption will emerge in the world, the three gateways to liberation will emerge in the world, all the meditative stabilities will emerge in the world, all the dhāraṇī gateways will emerge in the world, the ten powers of the tathāgatas will emerge in the world, the four fearlessnesses will emerge in the world, the four kinds of exact knowledge will emerge in the world, great loving kindness will emerge in the world, great compassion will emerge in the world, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas will emerge in the world, knowledge of all the dharmas will emerge in the world, the knowledge of the aspects of the path will emerge in the world, and all-aspect omniscience will emerge in the world.
“When bodhisattva great beings exist, great and lofty royal families will exist, great and lofty priestly families will exist, great and lofty householder families will exist, wheel-turning emperors will exist, the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm will exist, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm will exist, the gods of the Yāma realm will exist, the gods of the Tuṣita realm will exist, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm will exist, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm will exist; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm will exist, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm will exist, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm will exist, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm will exist; the gods of the Ābha realm will exist, the gods of the Parīttābha realm will exist, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm will exist, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm will exist; the gods of the Śubha realm will exist, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm will exist, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm will exist, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm will exist; the gods of the Vṛha realm will exist, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm will exist, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm will exist, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm will exist; and the gods of the Avṛha realm will exist, the gods of the Atapa realm will exist, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm will exist, the gods of the Sudarśana realm will exist, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm will exist.
“When bodhisattva great beings exist, the fruit of having entered the stream will exist and those who have entered the stream will exist, the fruit of once-returner will exist and once-returners will exist, the fruit of non-returner will exist and non-returners will exist, arhatship will exist and arhats will exist, and individual enlightenment will exist and pratyekabuddhas will exist.
“When bodhisattva great beings exist, the maturation of beings will exist, the refinement of the buddhafields will exist, and tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas will emerge in the world; the turning of the wheel of the Dharma will exist; and the precious jewel of the Buddha will exist, the precious jewel of the Dharma will exist, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will exist.
“Therefore, Blessed Lord, the world with its gods, humans, and asuras should guard, protect, and defend the bodhisattva great beings.”
Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, having said that, the Blessed One then said to him, “Kauśika, it is so, it is so!
When bodhisattva great beings exist, the hells, the animal realm, and the world of Yama are cut off; the inadequacies of gods are cut off; poverty among humans is cut off; all epidemics, misfortunes, and contagious diseases are cut off, vanish, and do not occur; and all the sorrows due to famine are cut off too.

“So it is that the world with its gods, humans, and asuras should serve, respect, honor, and worship the bodhisattva great beings and should always guard, protect, and defend them without interruption.
“Kauśika, those who think that I should be served, respected, honored, and worshiped think that bodhisattva great beings should be served, respected, honored, and worshiped.
And so it is that the world with its gods, humans, and asuras should serve, respect, honor, and worship the bodhisattva great beings and should always guard, protect, and defend them without interruption.
“To illustrate, Kauśika, if this billionfold world system were filled entirely with śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas––like a thicket of naḍa reeds, or a thicket of bamboo, or a grove of sugarcane, or a thicket of rushes, or a thicket of vetiver, or a paddy field of rice, or a field of sesame—and if some sons or daughters of good families were to serve, respect, honor, and worship them, with all the necessities, for as long as they lived, still, were someone to serve, respect, honor, and worship a single bodhisattva great being who has first set the mind on enlightenment and is not separated from the six perfections, that would be an increase in merit much greater than that.
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because it is not on account of the existence of those śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas that the bodhisattva great beings emerge in the world, and that the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas emerge in the world.
Rather, Kauśika, it is when bodhisattva great beings exist that all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas will exist in the world, and the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas will emerge in the world.
So it is, Kauśika, that the world with its gods, humans, and asuras should serve, respect, honor, and worship the bodhisattva great beings and should always guard, protect, and defend them without interruption.”
