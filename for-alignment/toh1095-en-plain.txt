The Noble King of
Prayers of Good Conduct
Homage to Noble Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta.
However many lions among men there are 
In the three times, in the worlds in the ten directions,
I pay homage to them all without exception, 
With purity of body, speech, and mind. {1} 
Thinking that all the jinas are before me,
With the power of the prayer of good conduct,
I bow down toward all the jinas 
With as many bodies as there are atoms in the realms. {2}
There are as many buddhas as atoms within a single atom,
Seated in the midst of bodhisattvas.
I focus on the entire realm of phenomena,
Without exception, being filled by jinas in that way. {3}
I recite a praise of all the sugatas,
Enumerating the qualities of all the jinas,
With unending oceans of eulogies
And the sound of oceans of every quality of voice. {4}
I make an offering to those jinas
Of perfect flowers, perfect garlands,
Perfect music, ointments, and parasols,
Perfect lights, and perfect incenses. {5}
I make offerings to those jinas
Of perfect clothing and perfect perfumes,
Pouches of scented powders equal to Mount Meru,
And all perfect, sublime displays. {6}
Offerings that are unsurpassable and exalted
I am resolved to offer to all the jinas.
I praise and make offerings to all the jinas
Through the power of devotion to good conduct.{7}
Whatever bad actions I have done
Under the power of desire, anger, and ignorance,
With my body, speech, and mind,
I make a confession of them all. {8}
I am rejoicing in the entirety of merit
In the ten directions that is created by beings,
By practicing and accomplished pratyeka­buddhas,
By the bodhisattvas, and by all the jinas. {9}
I make the request to all the lords, 
The lamps of the worlds in the ten directions, 
Who have attained without impediment the enlightenment of buddhahood,
That they turn the unsurpassable wheel. {10}
With palms placed together, I supplicate
Those who wish to manifest passing into nirvāṇa
That they remain for as many kalpas as there are atoms in the realms, 
For the benefit and happiness of all beings. {11} 
Whatever little virtue I have accumulated 
Through homage, offering, confession,
Rejoicing, supplication, and entreating, 
I dedicate it all to enlightenment. {12}
May the buddhas of the past and those who are present 
In the worlds of the ten directions be offered to.
May those in the future swiftly fulfill
Their aspirations for the enlightenment of buddhahood. {13}
May the realms that are in the ten directions
Become purified and sublime.
May they become filled with jinas, who have come
To the Bodhi tree, the lord of trees, and with bodhisattvas. {14}
However many beings there are in the ten directions,
May they all be always happy and healthy.
May all beings be successful in their Dharma goals,
And may their wishes be fulfilled. {15}
May I practice the conduct of enlightenment
And remember my lives in all existences.
May I always practice mendicancy
In all my lifetimes of deaths and rebirths. {16}
Following the teaching of all the jinas
And perfecting my good conduct,
May I always practice stainless, pure, 
Correct conduct that is flawless and unblemished. {17}
May I teach the Dharma in all languages,
Whatever the languages of beings:
Through the languages of devas, the languages of nāgas,
The languages of yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and humans. {18}
May one who is gentle and dedicated to the perfections
Never forget the aspiration to enlightenment.
May the obscurations of bad karma
Be purified without any remainder. {19}
May my conduct, even in the worldly existences, 
Be free of karma, kleśas, and the actions of Māra, 
Just as the lotus is unstained by water
And the sun and moon are unobstructed in the sky. {20} 
May I end all the sufferings of lower existences
And establish all beings in happiness, 
Practicing a conduct that brings benefit to all beings
Throughout the directions and the extent of realms. {21}
May I practice this conduct in all future kalpas, 
Conforming with the conduct of beings, 
Perfecting the conduct of enlightenment,
And teaching good conduct. {22} 
May I always be in the company of those
Whose conduct is in harmony with my conduct.
May my body, my speech, and also my mind
Practice the same conduct and have the same prayer. {23}
May I always associate
With friends who wish to benefit me
And teach me the correct conduct,
And may I never displease them. {24}
May I always see before me the jinas,
The lords who are encircled by bodhisattvas,
And may I make vast offerings to them,
Without wearying, throughout all future kalpas. {28}
Keeping the good Dharma of the jinas,
Expounding the conduct of enlightenment,
And purifying the good conduct,
May I practice that conduct in all future kalpas. {26}
While circling through all existences,
May I obtain inexhaustible merit and knowledge.
May I be an inexhaustible treasure of wisdom, 
Methods, samādhis, liberations, and all good qualities. {27}
There are realms as numerous as atoms in each atom,
And while practicing the conduct of enlightenment,
May I see in those realms countless buddhas
Who are seated in the midst of bodhisattvas. {28}
May I engage in practicing conduct for an ocean of kalpas 
Within every hair’s breadth in every direction,
Without exception, in which there are an ocean 
Of buddhas of the three times, and an ocean of realms. {29} 
May I always comprehend the speech of the buddhas, 
Which, through having an ocean of languages in a single syllable, 
Has the purity of the aspects of the speech of all the jinas
And words that accord with the aspirations of all beings. {30}
May I comprehend, through the power of the mind,
The unceasing sounds of the voices 
Of the jinas in the three times, 
Who are turning the wheel in various ways. {31} 
May I enter all the future kalpas,
Entering them in a single instant,
And in a fraction of an instant practice 
The conduct throughout the kalpas of the three times. {32}
May I in a single instant see 
The lions among humans in the three times.
Through the power of the liberation of being an illusion,
May I always enter into their conduct. {33}
May the displays of realms in the three times
Be accomplished within a single atom.
May I perceive such displays of the realms of the jinas
That are in every direction without exception. {34}
May I go into the presence of all those lords,
Those future lamps of the world, who will successively
Attain enlightenment, turn the wheel,
And demonstrate the final peace of entering nirvāṇa. {35}
Through the power of miracles that has complete speed,
Through the power of yānas that possesses every gateway,
Through the power of conduct that has the complete qualities,
Through the power of love that is universal, {36}
Through the power of merit that has complete goodness,
Through the power of knowledge that is without impediment,
Through the power of wisdom, methods, and samādhi,
May I accomplish the power of enlightenment. {37}
May I purify the power of karma,
Destroy the power of the kleśas,
Render powerless the power of the māras,
And make complete all the powers of good conduct. {38}
May I purify an ocean of realms,
Liberate an ocean of beings,
See an ocean of the Dharma,
And realize an ocean of knowledge. {39}
May I purify an ocean of conduct,
Fulfill an ocean of prayers,
Make offerings to an ocean of buddhas,
And have tireless conduct for an ocean of kalpas. {40}
May I, through good conduct, realize enlightenment
And fulfill, without exception, 
All the specific prayers of enlightened conduct
That are made by the jinas in the three times. {41} 
I dedicate all this virtue 
So that I may have the same conduct as that wise one,
The eldest son of all the jinas,
Whose name is Samanta­bhadra. {42}
Just as the good wise one made a dedication 
For a pure body, speech, and mind,
A pure conduct, and a pure realm,
May it be the same for me. {43}
May I practice the conduct of Mañjuśrī’s prayer
Of good conduct, for complete goodness,
Without weariness throughout the kalpas to come.
May I complete all those activities without exception. {44}
May there be no limit to that conduct;
May there be no limit to those good qualities,
And having maintained a conduct that has no limit,
May I give rise to all those miraculous powers. {45}
If there were an end to space,
There would be an end to all beings.
Only when their karma and kleśas end
Will my prayers also come to an end. {46}
If someone offered to the jinas the endless realms
In the ten directions adorned with jewels
And the most excellent pleasures of devas and humans
For kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a realm, {47}
Someone who has faith just once 
On hearing this king of dedications
And aspires to attain perfect enlightenment
Will have a higher, superior merit. {48} 
Whoever recites this prayer of good conduct
Will be free from all lower existences,
Will be free from bad companions,
And will quickly see Amitābha. {49}
They will have in this life the good fortune
Of obtaining success, a happy life, 
And will soon become 
The same as Samanta­bhadra. {50}
If someone through the power of ignorance 
Has the bad karma of the five actions with immediate results, 
They will be purified of it, without any remainder
Through reciting this prayer of good conduct. {51}
They will have the wisdom, form, 
Features, family, and color,
Be invincible to hosts of māras and tīrthikas,
And be offered to by the entire three realms. {52}
They will soon go to the Bodhi tree, the lord of trees,
And having reached there be seated for the benefit of beings,
Become enlightened in buddhahood, turn the wheel of the Dharma,
And overpower Māra and his entire army. {53}
The Buddha knows the result that ripens
For the one who possesses, recites, 
Or teaches this prayer of good conduct.
Do not doubt the supreme enlightenment! {57}
Just as the hero Mañjuśrī knows,
In that way so does Samanta­bhadra.
In practicing in the same way as they do,
I am dedicating all this merit. {55}
With the prayer that is praised as supreme
By all the jinas in the three times,
I am dedicating all this merit
For the supreme good conduct. {56}
When the time has come for me to die,
May I dispel all obscurations,
See Amitābha before me,
And go to the Sukhāvatī realm. {57}
When I have gone there, may these prayers
All become completely manifest.
May I fulfill them all without exception
And benefit beings for as long as there are worlds. {58}
May I be born from a beautiful, perfect lotus
In that pleasant, beautiful circle of the jinas,
And there obtain my prophecy
Directly from the Jina Amitābha. {59}
Having obtained there the prophecy,
May I through the power of mind 
Bring many benefits to beings in the ten directions
Through many billions of emanations. {60}
May what little merit I have accumulated
Through reciting the good conduct prayer
Cause the virtuous prayers of beings
All to be fulfilled in an instant. {61} 
Through the sublime, endless merit attained
By my dedicating the good conduct,
May the beings drowning in a river of suffering
Depart to the supreme residence of Amitābha. {62}
The principal excellence of this King of Prayers 
Brings benefit to all beings without end,
And being a text ornamented by Samantabhadra,
May the three lower realms, without exception, be emptied. {63}
This concludes “The Noble King of Prayers of Good Conduct.”
