The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra
The Questions of Brahmadatta
 Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas. 
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, together with a great assembly of two hundred fifty thousand monks and a large number of bodhisattva great beings. All of these were bodhisattvas who were versed in extraordinary knowledge, had acquired extraordinary knowledge along with dhāraṇī, samādhi, and unimpeded dhāraṇī, and were skilled in the dhāraṇīs that accomplish the seal of infinite gateways. They dwelled in emptiness, they had the experience of signlessness, and they had aspirations that were not imputed. They all had reached the acceptance that phenomena are unarisen.
Then, the bodhisattva  Amoghadarśin, together with about five hundred bodhisattvas, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. After traveling through several towns, they finally arrived in the region of Pañcāla. When King Brahmadatta learned of the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin’s arrival in his land, he felt pleased and happy, and he rejoiced. Overjoyed and content, he led a large following of people to the place where the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin was staying. When he arrived there, he prostrated by touching his head to the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin’s feet, then sat to one side. His many followers also prostrated by touching their heads to the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin’s feet, then sat to one side. 
When he saw that King Brahmadatta and his assembled retinue and attendants were present, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin said to him, “Great King, an anointed king of royal descent who possesses five attributes will continuously progress while traversing saṃsāra and will never take birth in unfavorable states. He will also meet and please thus-gone ones. When the blessed buddhas teach the Dharma, he will also master their allegorical speech. He will maintain uninterrupted mindfulness, look attractive, and not lack any sense faculty. The blessed buddhas will also speak to him with words of absolute truth; that is to say, they will demonstrate the four truths.
“What are these five attributes? 
“Great King, an anointed king of royal descent possesses faith. He possesses a mind that is strong in faith and is without animosity. His faith is also demonstrated to be rooted in certainty.  His faith should furthermore be observed in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He gives without deceit. (2) He gives away all possessions completely. (3) He has no excessive pride. (4) He has exceptional clarity. (5) He does not apprehend any fault in the teachings of the noble ones. (6) He does not investigate the best, intermediate, or lesser monks for mistakes. (7) He believes in emptiness. (8) His physical actions are pure. (9) His verbal actions are pure. (10) His mental activity is pure.
“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this first attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.
“Moreover, Great King, an anointed king of royal descent longs for the Dharma. He always yearns to behold the noble ones, and he insatiably seeks to hear the Dharma. Using his mind he carefully investigates the many things he has learned, and then fully realizes them through experience. Great King, a king should be understood to be endowed with the Dharma if he has ten qualities. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He is without concern for his body or life in his quest for the Dharma. (2) He possesses a mindset that is weary of saṃsāra. (3) He thinks that a householder’s life entails too many faults. (4) He has a mindset that is not concerned with material things. (5) He is critical toward the negative actions that stem from his previous karma, and he does not create future formations. (6) He possesses a mindset that discriminates between all that is attractive and all that is repulsive. (7) Mastering his intent, he perfects the conduct of a bodhisattva and does not privilege words. (8) He is steadfast in his commitments because he seeks wisdom. (9) He fosters awakening in his servants and retinue and completely matures them  continuously with the gift of the Dharma. (10) He also fulfills their material needs. 
“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this second attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.
“Moreover, Great King, an anointed king of royal descent believes in accepting the profound Dharma and accomplishes the samādhi of emptiness. His interest in the profundity of the Dharma should also be understood in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) His actions accord with his words. (2) He completes all his virtuous Dharma activities with very strong devotion and rids himself of the formations of unpleasant actions. (3) He creates pleasing formations. (4) He does not unjustly suppress individuals who possess power and riches. (5) He provides others with pleasing gifts and eliminates all that is not pleasant. (6) Thinking that all phenomena are empty, he cultivates renunciation. (7) His view is free of contrivance, thus he neither believes in the singularity of the limit of reality nor holds concepts of its multiplicity. (8) He does not use his own qualities to belittle the qualities of others. (9) He does not form definite judgments. (10) He brings those who do not practice into alignment with the inconceivable realm of phenomena.
“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this third attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned. 
“Moreover, Great King, when an anointed king of royal descent clearly perceives the contamination that comes from the harm of living in this world, he upholds the teachings for the sake of accomplishing unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening. He perseveres  in generating the power of the six perfections and never tires of fully maturing sentient beings. Furthermore, the ways in which he upholds the teachings should be understood in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He perseveres in attaining samādhi that is unimpeded by the eight worldly concerns. (2) He perseveres in seeking out the dhāraṇīs. (3) He is skilled in ascertaining so that he completely apprehends the supreme Dharma. (4) He never tires of providing various necessities to those who persevere, including clothes, food, bedding, cushions, and medicines to cure sickness. (5) He strives to encourage awakening. (6) He thinks excellent thoughts, speaks excellent words, and performs excellent deeds. (7) He is inclined towards renunciation. (8) He thinks that it is a mistake to delight in being a king. (9) He possesses a mindset that has no concern for any beautiful or pleasant forms. (10) At the very least he does not think that anything is accomplished by only craving kingship. 
“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this fourth attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.
 “Moreover, Great King, an anointed king of royal descent follows the Dharma in guarding, protecting, and shielding those who uphold, read, and teach unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening, which one fully accomplishes in a hundred billion trillion incalculable eons. He likewise punishes beings who are harmful to such individuals in order to completely protect the enjoyment of this resource of Dharma. His effort to completely uphold the supreme Dharma  should also be understood in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He accomplishes it completely. (2) He regards it as absolutely invaluable. (3) He believes in the Dharma. (4) He always acts without confusion. (5) He desires wisdom and has trust in distinctions of enlightened qualities. (6) He acts as a messenger of the Thus-Gone One. (7) He is a suitable vessel for buddhahood. (8) He holds together the lineage of the Three Jewels. (9) He causes the supreme Dharma to blaze brightly. (10) He completely matures many people.
“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this fifth attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.” 
After this, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin recited the following verses: 
“The king who always has a sincere attitude 
Toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha 
Has indestructible faith and confidence
And never lacks the following qualities. 
“His faith is not contrived but is born from understanding, 
And he does not hang on to anything he owns.
Rather, he feels no regret when it is given away. 
These qualities are a sign of faith. 
“Those whose thoughts are always unsullied
Are unshakable like the indestructible Mount Meru. 
Just as a full vase does not move when it is well placed,
Their faith is absolutely unmoving.
“Those who see without seeing and hear without hearing 
Are immovable like a mountain.
Such are the characteristics of faith,
Which will not change at all in any situation. 
“Wise ones who wish for the Dharma because they wish for peace
Should abandon everything else for the sake of the Dharma
And, after abandoning everything, should not think of it. 
These are the characteristics of those who wish for the Dharma. 
“When a lord of humans who wishes for the Dharma
Does not listen to the eloquent teachings,
Like a rotten seed sown in a bad field,
The pure instructions of the Leader of Beings will not grow. 
“Even if one hears them, but thinks, ‘I am wise in them,’ 
Or, ‘I have realized the exact nature of all phenomena,’
One cannot purify their conduct with a sincere attitude;
How can one with a dualistic mind become pure?
“Those who wish for the Dharma with mindfulness,
Who are respectful, unwavering, not stupid like sheep, 
And are not like a rushing torrent but like a still ocean—
Such are vessels for supreme awakening. 
“Those who wish for the Dharma 
Never cling to any outer or inner things.
They are cherished by the knowledgeable and criticized by fools.
These are the ways to recognize people who wish for the Dharma. 
“Therefore, as a king who wishes for the Dharma,
Practice purely after hearing these words,
And don't fixate on mere words or studies; 
There is no wisdom in degenerate thoughts.
“Those who believe in the acceptance of the profound
Do not cling to pleasant or unpleasant forms.
Just like the wind, they have no attachment,
Yet they practice for hundreds of infinite eons. 
“King, if awakening is what you wish for,
Purify your thoughts with a sincere attitude.
Do not remain in this mistaken state
Because of prideful thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine.’
“You should continuously confess faults.
You should maintain favorable vows.
Regard power and relationships as impermanent.
This absence of support is genuine emptiness. 
“However many teachings on emptiness you preach,
This is not abiding in emptiness just as it is.
Anyone who acts contrary to reality
Does not accept the profound way. 
“Thus, this emptiness is totally wrong.
One who knows emptiness just as it is
Will escape the worldly realm and reach supreme awakening
Like the king of geese leaving a swamp.
“After generating respect for the Thus-Gone One,
King, you should examine what he has taught.
King, because the body is going to fall apart completely,
Do not get discouraged on the vehicle to awakening. 
“You should always protect the wise,
Who know the texts, experience, and rites of the Teacher.
Do not fall under the influence of mere words,
For you will undoubtedly remain sick for a long time. 
“One who examines the teachings thoroughly
Should focus within in order to truly guard them. 
Abandoning the myriad afflictions and karma,
One will attain in particular the supreme awakening. 
“Train well in the six perfections.
Through training in them, you will attain supreme awakening. 
Put into practice all that has been taught,
And before long you will achieve the virtues of omniscience. 
“The mind that relates to objects
Like a bee unattached to a flower's nectar
Or a bird leaving no trace in the sky,
Is a mind, O King, that reaches buddhahood.
“You should follow the Dharma in protecting 
Those who have found acceptance and courage for the profound
And hold the treasury of the buddhas.
Never forsake such wise ones, even at the cost of your life. 
“There are many people, devoid of Dharma,
Who strive to harm such wise ones;
You should constantly prevent this through punishments,
Or else the way of the Dharma will quickly degenerate. 
“If the Lord of the World does not appear,
Those wise ones will be the teachers of the world.
They will light the lamp of the Dharma for the benefit of living beings. 
Therefore, devote yourself always to their benefit.
“There are many tens of billions of bodhisattvas
Who do not act for the benefit of sentient beings from their hearts.
They have neither a sincere attitude nor ethical discipline.
The Conqueror will not make prophecies about them. 
“Those who act in accordance with what I have just described
Are endowed with the experience of nonarising. 
You, King, having listened to these correct practices,
Should abide by these teachings I have revealed.” 
Thereafter, King Brahmadatta said the following to the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin: “Amoghadarśin, apparently I have all of the shortcomings  but none of the good qualities. Amoghadarśin, I am contaminated with harmful pollutants. Amoghadarśin, I am strongly addicted to unjust actions. I always intensely seek out wealth and gather attendants. Consequently, my thoughts arise due to a malevolent attitude that I am incapable of removing. Besides that, I have also thrashed others with sticks and struck them with weapons. Therefore, Amoghadarśin, I did not generate the mind of awakening. I generated a malevolent attitude toward others, even in my dreams. Amoghadarśin, I shall now generate with a sincere attitude the unsurpassed, complete, and perfect mind of awakening. Amoghadarśin, if I do not train in the precepts of bodhisattvas as they are delineated, it will amount to deceiving all the blessed buddhas who dwell in the world systems of the ten directions. In order to fully accomplish unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening, I shall act exactly as you have spoken.” 
Thereafter eighty thousand beings, following after King Brahmadatta, generated the unsurpassed, complete, and perfect mind of awakening for the first time, and they also prayed to achieve the conduct of a bodhisattva as it was expounded. Twenty thousand beings acquired the pure eye of Dharma that is flawless and without defilements with respect to all phenomena.
Then, King Brahmadatta said the following to the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin: “Amoghadarśin, out of your love for me and for the benefit of the people gathered here, please consent to remain here at my place to observe the summer retreat. 
“Amoghadarśin, we may not meet the conditions of being a vessel,  we may not meet the conditions of having the scope of experience, and we may not be people of equal status to the fortunate ones. Also, since we do not see the Thus-Gone One or listen to the Dharma continuously, our accumulation of the roots of virtue may not be so large, and we may not have matured many sentient beings. Nevertheless, your presence will benefit us.” 
Then, the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin, along with some five hundred other bodhisattvas, accepted King Brahmadatta’s request out of love for him. King Brahmadatta prepared a variety of bedding, cushions, mats, clothing, and food for the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin and his retinue of five hundred bodhisattvas. He also made various Dharma offerings to the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin.
At that time, there were sixty monks staying in that place. All of them were lazy, limited in their studies, full of hostile intent, and resentful when others received offerings. They claimed to be bodhisattvas themselves, but were coarse, crude bodhisattvas. They indulged their senses; they were wild, proud, and vain; they talked nonsense and were deceitful like crows. They had no regard for their next lives and no fear of karma; they enjoyed foolish talk, slept excessively, and had desire for what is not the Dharma. Their physical, verbal, and mental actions were without any restraint; they were argumentative, resented those with ethical discipline, and took no interest at all in the knowledge of others.
They did not even like to see the teacher, let alone fellow practitioners of pure conduct. Thus, they denigrated the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin in a manner that was not in accord with the Dharma.  Moreover, they spread such remarks by visiting the homes of brahmins and householders with little faith, who, as a result of listening, would be born and live as denizens of the great hells for eight hundred million eons. The bodhisattva Amoghadarśin did not tell this to King Brahmadatta because of his compassion for those sentient beings. 
At that time, King Brahmadatta had a court priest, a brahmin named Thorough Obscurer. He caused a rift between the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin and the monks who were there, and he made rude remarks that were at odds with the Dharma. He also secretly caused a rift between King Brahmadatta and the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin. He furthermore discouraged all those who had developed extraordinary joy in the Dharma and used every possible means to plant disdain for the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin in their minds. Even when he participated in Dharma discussions, he spoke in opposition to the Dharma, thereby carrying out by every means the activities of the crude bodhisattvas.
In this regard, bodhisattvas are crude when they possess four attributes. What are these four? They are as follows: (1) They are deceitful like a crow, talk nonsense, and do not accommodate other perspectives. (2) They praise themselves and criticizes others. (3) They are obsessed with this life and have negative thoughts. (4) They aggressively sow discord. Bodhisattvas are crude when they possess these four attributes. 
The bodhisattva Amoghadarśin completed the summer retreat there in both comfort and suffering, and with happiness and sadness. Why was this so? Well, someone who dwells with a lazy person tends to suffer. Thus, the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin observed the summer retreat, and after the three months had passed, he  made and completed a Dharma robe. He then left, carrying his alms bowl and Dharma robe. After passing through several kingdoms, he finally arrived at the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, where the Blessed One was residing. Arriving there, he touched the Blessed One’s feet with his head to pay homage and sat to one side.
King Brahmadatta later heard the news that the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin had gone directly to the Blessed One because the resident monks had mistreated him. King Brahmadatta, along with ten thousand others, thus left the region of Pañcāla for Kośala where the Blessed One was residing. Arriving there, he touched the Blessed One’s feet with his head to pay homage and sat to one side. After he sat down, King Brahmadatta said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin left my country too soon.” 
The Blessed One replied, “Great King, the Thus-Gone One and the hearers of the Thus-Gone One do not share a dwelling with individuals who are jealous, make no effort whatsoever, are fond of gossip, engage in excessive foolish talk, are very poorly behaved, and do not practice. Great King, know that there are ten causes for a person's lack of effort. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) sleeping excessively, (2) cultivating the blatant pride of thinking oneself wise, (3) praising oneself, (4) criticizing others, (5) being fond of foolish talk, (6) being fond of gossip, (7) being fond of crowds, (8) clinging strongly to wealth, (9) clinging strongly to respect, and (10) being a hypocrite.
“Great King, an individual who possesses these ten causes  is known as one who lacks effort.”
Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses:
“Those who are unreasonable are always inharmonious;
They remain as far from the wise ones
As a corpse in the ocean
Or a creature riding on a bird.
“Those without faith search for faults in others;
They speak foolishly and are fond of being in a crowd,
They do not respect the teachings of the conquerors,
And they will migrate to the lower realms immediately after death.
“Those who are lacking have neither mindfulness nor wisdom;
They will not pass into or reach nirvāṇa and do not have ethical discipline,
And like a blind person on a road,
They stray farther and farther from the path of the noble ones. 
“Persons who are lacking will talk too much;
They like to laugh and their senses are always distracted; 
Regarding the teachings, they are not fit to drink the dregs of a water pot,
And the food they receive from villages will go down like lumps of iron.
“When a donor makes an offering out of faith,
For those not lacking and for the liberated, it is I who give it.
If one who is lacking consumes even a single morsel,
My disapproval will be as great as Mount Meru. 
“According to the teachings, food provided by royalty is difficult to purify.
Even those who are not lacking abstain from it. 
If those who are lacking consume it like a vulture,
They will be reborn as an elephant, horse, cow, or donkey.
“When they eat it they will take contemptible forms,
Becoming skeletal, weak, and loathsome. 
After eating alms food they will be filthy and exude a foul odor,
And can only be purified by being struck with a rod. 
“Their minds will be distracted, and their mindfulness will erode away;
They will be forced to beg and will go mad. 
Despite obtaining this meritorious platform of the teachings,
If they are not heedful, they will fall into the lower realms.
“For an infinite million trillion years,
They will undergo great suffering in the lower realms,
After which they will obtain the relief of the human world,
But due to their misdeeds they will fall again into the lower realms. 
“When a lump of iron plummets into the great ocean
Its location is not fixed. 
Even after ten billion years
It will be impossible to recover it again from the ocean.
“It is the same for the childish ones who fall into the lower realms.
For a hundred billion trillion eons,
It is doubtful that they will again be born as human beings.
How can they attain the higher realms and awakening?
“With a pure mind and lasting diligence,
With perfect restraint and without being deceptive,
And with a mind of equanimity, one can attain awakening. 
For such a person, the state of omniscience is not difficult.
“Great King, recognize the following sixteen things as characteristics of jealous people. What are these sixteen? They are as follows: (1) being deceitful like a crow, (2) talking foolishly, (3) lacking self-control, (4) being pleased when others are denounced, (5) doubting the qualities of others, (6) thinking excessively, (7) being excessively sorrowful, (8) possessing extreme mental discomfort, (9) being envious, (10) possessing a decrepit figure and complexion, (11) being overwhelmed with pride, (12) disliking monks, (13) being rude toward unexpected visitors, (14) looking for mistakes to start an argument, (15) being stingy regarding one’s residence, and (16) not attending teachings, not listening with attention but having a distracted mind, spreading rumors, and saying with contempt for the Dharma, ‘I don’t understand what was said. It is a foolish, mundane, and conventional Dharma being taught.’ 
“These people, who have no respect for the Vinaya and Dharma that was realized by the noble ones, are ignorant fools. 
“Saying, ‘I shall attain awakening; only then shall I sit under the Bodhi tree and be respectful toward the Dharma,’ they stand outside the door and listen even when the Dharma is being taught to the monks. They think, ‘I am not willing to sit down. But, since it provides the monks with their livelihood, I will listen when there is a talk on the eight branches of awakening. If I listen to this, my illness will be dispelled.’  Thus these foolish people who chase after awakening by yearning for what is not the Dharma are like people who pluck out their eyes and then want to see. They are like those wishing to satisfy many guests after getting rid of all their wealth. They are like those wishing to follow a path after cutting off their legs. Great King, this is how these foolish people with such wishes think about awakening.
“Great King, someone who has fallen away from awakening should be understood as having the following twenty-five attributes. What are the twenty-five? They are as follows: (1) being stingy regarding their residence; (2) being stingy regarding their household; (3) being stingy with their praise; (4) being jealous; (5) having no faith; (6) being shameless; (7) being immodest; (8) being malicious; (9) being deceptive; (10) being harmful toward others; (11) behaving in a way that is self-absorbed; (12) being hypocritical; (13) being vengeful; (14) excessively accumulating wealth; (15) misinterpreting and exaggerating the teachings of the Thus-Gone One out of fear and thus (16) abandoning the Dharma; (17) not asking any questions because of excessive pride; (18) lacking remorse, even after betraying the Dharma; (19) being dislikable and having many enemies; (20) after joining the assembly, exposing someone’s faults immediately upon seeing them in an attempt to reverse others’ fondness for them; (21) scorning those who have trust in secret topics; (22) disparaging monks whether one has previously seen them or not, thinking that no one should like them; (23) disparaging in order to harm; (24) forsaking others in order to disparage them; and (25) guarding their ethical discipline motivated by the thought that failing to keep the fully ordained monk’s vows would not bring as much profit.
“Great King, such individuals will seriously drift from the teachings,  or they will become householders.” 
Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses: 
“Like crows they are deceitful and talk nonsense without restraint.
They are disrespectful to the teachings of the knowers of the world,
Proud, shameless, and combative at all times— 
These are the signs of those who are overwhelmed with jealousy.
“How can awakening be achieved 
By those who feel no unhappiness when others are criticized,
Who like a pauper finding gold, cherish it and forsake all else,
And who have the intention to cause harm?
“In the past they cultivated a vindictive attitude, 
Which ripened in their experience of the lower realms. 
They are jealous even now, despite having found a human body,
And in appearance are dull and ugly.
“Time and again, they mock everyone;
Their minds are always hostile.
Even upon seeing the expertise of others,
They become jealous and so abandon the Dharma.
“As they are wild and their hearts know no restraint,
They speak about many bad things with others;
And even when others have not spoken negatively,
They pass their nights intending to fight.
“In town they behave differently,
While in the temple they act like wild horses.
They recognize others’ faults but not their own.
Such are the attributes of those who are jealous. 
“They will think, ‘Now, I definitely won't stay around here,
But will say such-and-such things in that person's house.
Tomorrow I will speak offensively . . . .’ 
This is how they keep plotting with a malicious mindset. 
“Their minds are full of sorrow and without joy.
When they see others venerated because of what they know,
They lose their conviction in the ripening of karma,
And, controlled by vice, they speak critically.
“When honor and respect grows
For wise ones who have mastered the remedies,
Jealous people do not recognize them as holders of the supreme Dharma
Who practice unsurpassed, supreme generosity.
“If they see monks who are gentle in their pure activity
Suddenly coming, they feel ashamed.
With disrespect they say faithless things, 
Such as ‘What do you want in this miserable place? 
“ ‘There is always a lot of work in this monastery,
And with nothing to gain, your activities here will be unbearable.’
If the monks refuse to leave despite their dissuasions, 
They will lose their temper and pick a fight.
“There are no such people in this pure place.
Remember what happened in the other land?
After the resident monks expelled you,
Did you come here to disparage them?
“Naive lay disciples do not understand;
They do not know who has ethical discipline or who is unethical.
Monks leave frequently, both willingly and unwillingly, 
And certainly leave when facing spite and viciousness.
“When this is seen by Dharma teachers,
Students of the Buddha who are gentle, superior, and steadfast,
They say it is inappropriate to clash with fools,
And that they will just go back where they came from.
“How sad! These teachings of mine that guide,
This Dharma of the conquerors, will come to an end;
These wicked monks will proliferate,
While those who preach the Dharma decrease. 
“When a learned individual suddenly arrives
And reveals that which brings joy to many people,
They say, ‘What does one with such little intelligence know?’ 
And they pronounce to others their lack of respect. 
“They have neither received transmissions nor asked Dharma questions.
What is their preceptor like and who is their master?
Like a self-sprouting tree, they don their Dharma robe
And seek wealth for their own happiness.
“They think, ‘He is not learned in the collection of sūtras,
And we know as much as he knows.’ 
They are foolish and refute the teachings.
They have not attained samādhi, and they think like a child. 
“King, as I recall in past times,
There was a buddha called Jñānaprabha.
He taught the Dharma for eighty thousand years,
After which the conqueror attained nirvāṇa. 
“After that conqueror had passed,
When the sublime Dharma declined and came close to an end,
A monk named Mindful Intellect appeared—
He did not attain dhāraṇī, but he had obtained eloquence. 
“He was good looking, gentle, and well-spoken,
And always satisfied with plain, simple things.
Like a cloud satisfying all beings with its rain,
He satisfied all migratory beings, including the gods, with the Dharma.
“At that time, there was upon the earth a town
Called Vyūharāja;
It measured eight yojanas in circumference,
And the people there were intelligent and happy with bountiful harvests.
“When Mindful Intellect, the teacher of the Dharma, arrived,
He gave Dharma teachings for the benefit of all living beings.
Two hundred thirty million living beings 
Became established in the state of unsurpassed awakening.
“With flowers, incense, and garments, 
And with delicacies, libations, and wholesome songs, 
And with excellent sounds from musical instruments,
They worshiped him as they would a buddha.
“Five hundred monks became extremely hostile;
They spread criticism of him in the town,
Saying, ‘He has no ethical discipline; he is a miscreant, and I know this to be so’
To each and every person they met.
“During the restoration and purification rites on the day of the full moon,
Some of these wicked monks stood up and said,
‘If you do not leave quickly, by tonight,
We will slash your vital parts and kill you.’
“With compassion for those monks,
The pure sentient being left undismayed.
Thousands of gods mourned and cried,
‘Why is this child of the Buddha being harassed?’
“All of the five hundred monks there
Passed the whole night laughing, elated.
They thought, ‘At last! We are finally free of him,’
And felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted. 
“When the five hundred monks died,
They remained in hell for eighty eons.
For a period of seven hundred sixty trillion eons,
Those monks lived in the world of hungry ghosts.
“Life after life, these sentient beings will become blind.
They will be born as venomous snakes and eat dust.
Children will pelt them with clods of dirt when they see them.
They will have neither protectors nor defenders.
“For one hundred eighty billion lifetimes,
They will be born into poverty in the human realm. 
They will go mad and go blind, and their bodies will continuously rot.
They will look ugly, be contemptible, and have little power.
“They will be afflicted in that way for five billion years. 
They themselves will always do many unpleasant things
And find fault in the generous acts of others.
They will throw themselves into a deep abyss.
“In the future, the sixtieth eon
Will be called the Eon of Great Fame.
During that time there will appear ten thousand thus-gone ones
Who will protect and benefit the world.
“During the time of the last of those buddhas,
Those five hundred monks will obtain their human forms.
After seeing that buddha, they will attain the state of acceptance
And will see as many buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River.
“In the past, all of them together
Had made aspirations for the mind of omniscience,
Yet at that stage they had not generated the mind of awakening.
Depending on their particular mental states, they fell into the lower realms. 
“At that time, I was a Dharma preacher, a conqueror’s son, 
Known as Mindful Intellect.
Those who refuted me were shown to be refuted.
Thus, they gave up pride and left it behind.
“They gave up what was unsuitable and practiced wisdom. 
Those who do not wish to destroy themselves,
After discarding all ignorant speaking,
Should also get rid of jealousy as if it were a mass of flame.
“Whether they are seen or unseen, heard or unheard,
True or untrue, do not discuss them with others—
A monk who wishes to attain supreme awakening
Will remove his own faults.
“Those who are gentle will give away
All outer and inner things. 
Why would one aspiring to my supreme awakening
Take delight in anything else?
“In the future many crude people
Will deny awakening in connection with my teachings.
They plunge into gorges and chasms—
How can one with degenerate thoughts reach awakening? 
“One who wishes to attain my supreme awakening
Gets rid of pride, as does a low-caste boy,
Generates the mind of love for all sentient beings,
And is never dissatisfied whether there is attainment or no attainment. 
“Also, Great King, the Thus-Gone One and the hearers of the Thus-Gone One will not want to stay for long in places where there are people who lack  respect and faith and who hate others and seek to harm them. They will leave such places immediately.
“Great King, there are sixteen attributes that describe an individual who lacks faith. What are these sixteen? They are (1) instigating discord, (2) considering wicked teachings reasonable, (3) considering Dharma talks unreasonable, (4) having wicked thoughts, (5) having a mind that is proud, (6) seeking to harm, (7) having ulterior motives, (8) possessing a livelihood that is totally impure, (9) desiring respect, (10) having a mental continuum that is not virtuous, (11) lacking practice, (12) belittling others, (13) being fully intent on finding only faults, (14) not ascertaining the teachings, (15) holding wrong views, and (16) doubting the ripening of karma.
“Great King, these sixteen attributes describe an individual who lacks faith.” 
Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses: 
“Those who do not properly adhere to the teachings
Abandon them completely like a dried-up well.
Those who follow another stream that is incompatible with liberation
Are no different from hostile-minded heretics.
“They do not believe in the ripening of karma.
Since they do not believe, they do not provide for others.
Regarding themselves to be as high as the summit of Mount Meru,
They act like someone who is intoxicated with pride. 
“When the well-spoken Dharma is explained to them,
They find it disagreeable due to their wicked perspective.
Without faith, they generate doubt toward the Dharma
And lose their minds for many tens of millions of eons.
“They will become wicked from their thoughts that lack faith.
They do nothing to guard against a mind filled with anger.
Abandoning everything that is of substance,
Those without faith will cling to defilements.
“Posturing and always arrogant,
Those who lack faith will not bow to others.
After their deaths, they will be born into lower castes,
Become destitute, and resent others. 
“Those who lack faith do not assess themselves.
They find faults in others and hold on to their mistakes.
Like a castor-oil tree in a forest,
They are neither householders nor monks.
“They are as deceitful as they are impure.
They simply do not follow anyone’s teachings.
They resent others, even when they are trusted.
They will never be a friend, even if one sustains them for an eon. 
“Their livelihood is impure.
Without faith, these ordained monks 
Forsake the many teachings that liberate them,
And thus, before very long, they will fall. 
“Since, lacking faith, they desire veneration,
They make others understand things that are untrue.
Acting deceitfully and hiding their true nature,
They attempt to trick and flatter. 
“Their mental states are always hateful and discordant.
Even when they hear others talk,
They think the conversation is about them.
Without faith, they become consumed by doubt.
“They make comments about others
And see others as impure as they are themselves. 
Without faith, they are like frightened deer—
They find that no one is reliable or agreeable.
“Their practice is degenerate and they disregard the feelings of others.
They become intimidated at gatherings;
With trembling hands, they pick fights,
And they even put an end to those they come across.
“Thus, their assertions and criticisms are unfounded.
Slanderous by nature, they are abundantly wicked,
And they are unfriendly, confrontational, and angry.
These are the natural marks of those who are without faith. 
“After those without faith are ordained, 
They refute even the teachings of the Guide.
Whenever there is harmony among the Saṅgha,
They contradict with words that are not of the Dharma. 
“Since they question the teachings of the conquerors, 
They are like heretics doubting and hesitating, 
Bringing harm to the Dharma and contradicting it.
Without faith, they reject even the Dharma.
“When they fail to abandon wrong views,
They are condemned to join with non-Buddhist heretics. 
They are not rooted in the teachings
And are called monks merely because they wear Dharma robes.
“By deeply cultivating immutable selflessness,
A monk free of the view of the transitory collection
Will experience the wisdom of the teachings
And like the wind will not be attached to compounded things.
“Without faith, they are not convinced of karma.
Falling under the power of wicked thoughts,
They will soon reside in the lower realms,
Tormented just as they tormented others. 
“Just as water constitutes the great ocean,
Faith in this teaching is the basis.
As for anyone who does not have faith in the teachings,
I am not for them, and they are not for me.
“Faith is the basis for this wondrous journey.
It is the path and light that lead to the elixir.
Just like the king of Jambudvīpa,
It is the foremost of all qualities. 
“Great King, the monks in your monastery lacked qualities such as these. Therefore, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin examined them individually and did not stay but quickly departed. 
“Great King, after they die and pass on, all of those sixty monks will circle in the lower realms for three eons. Thereafter, they will be born into low classes of beings for eighty thousand lives; they will be inferior, survive on leftover food, and be reviled by the world. They will have emaciated bodies, be of hideous complexion, be considered insignificant, be disfigured, and be afflicted with chronic ailments in almost all successive lifetimes. They will be agitated due to imbalanced health, wail with pitiful voices, and die in a bad state. 
“Then, after dying in their last lifetime, they will be reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī. For eighty thousand years they will hear but not understand the teachings of the thus-gone Amitāyus. They will be able to see that thus-gone one’s light but not him; his light will not even shine on their bodies. In order to purify their faults completely,  they will confess their faults to the gathering of bodhisattvas three times a day and three times a night, with their limbs and heads touching the ground. Only then will their actions become completely purified. Thereafter, they will be able to see the Thus-Gone One, understand the teachings, and receive predictions regarding their awakening.”
Then King Brahmadatta said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, give me your permission to remove these monks. I do not wish for such wicked monks to be known among my subjects, let alone be seen.” Then King Brahmadatta dispatched his men in order to remove those monks, ensuring that they did not remain among his subjects. “Blessed One, this is the fruition of their karma in this life. These are people who will harm themselves in future lives as well.” 
As he said this, the Blessed One said to King Brahmadatta, “Great King, there are four pitfalls for those who have gone forth into this teaching of mine. What are these four? They are as follows: (1) not respecting the Buddha, (2) forsaking the supreme Dharma, (3) loathing those who teach the Dharma, and (4) taking offerings given with faith when one lacks true effort.
“Great King, these are the four pitfalls for those who have gone forth into this teaching of mine.” 
Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses: 
“Doubting the Buddha is the ultimate pitfall.
The whole word cannot protect such a person.
Such a narrow-minded person turns from the teacher,
And without a protector will migrate to the lower realms. 
“Forsaking the Dharma, they migrate to a lower existence.
For a period of no less than a thousand years,
They will be blind, with dull senses and a degenerate mind.
This great suffering is the second pitfall. 
“To deprecate those who are fearless in upholding the Buddha's teachings,
And who sustain the wisdom of omniscience,
Is the third great pitfall; 
It is experienced for many tens of millions of eons. 
“Those who misuse offerings given by the faithful,
Which is the fourth great pitfall,
Will be impossible to protect, even by the entire world.
Possessing bad karma, they will wander through all lower existences. 
“The purity of thoughts is the purity of the noble ones.
Not wavering from awakening, that is the basis of the mind.
One cannot attain awakening through mere words.
One must also purify the mind—this is taught by the Thus-Gone One.
When the Blessed One spoke this discourse of the Dharma, five thousand beings generated the aspiration for unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening, which they had never done before, and achieved the acceptance of phenomena as unarisen. King Brahmadatta also became irreversibly oriented toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening. One hundred thousand beings possessed the pure eye of the Dharma, which is devoid of stains and free from defilements with respect to phenomena. One hundred million gods generated the mind of awakening, which they had never done before. 
The Blessed One then smiled, and as happens whenever the blessed ones smile, at that moment light of myriad colors—blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystalline, and silver—emerged from his mouth. The light illuminated boundless, limitless realms and reached all the way up to the world of Brahmā. It even eclipsed the magnificence of the sun and moon. Then the light rays returned, circled around the Blessed One three times, and dissolved into the crown of his head. 
Then the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin folded his hands and bowed in the direction of the Blessed One and asked him, “Blessed One, what are the causes of your smile? What are the conditions?” 
The Blessed One said,  “Amoghadarśin, King Brahmadatta will not fall into any bad state for thirty eons, and after enjoying the bounties of the gods and humans, he will please eight hundred million buddhas. In all his lives, he will be universal emperor. Forsaking the four continents completely, he will respect and revere the blessed buddhas with an intention free of any hostility.
“Thereafter, he will actually attain buddhahood—unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening—in a buddha field that will be equal in display to Sukhāvatī, and he will become a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha called King of Limitless Display.” 
Thus, King Brahmadatta felt contented, elated, jubilant, and overjoyed. Happy and blissful, he bowed down with the five points of his body at the feet of the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin. He then said, “Blessed One, because Amoghadarśin endured being with that community of monks for my sake, I sincerely appeal to him for forgiveness.” Out of his love for King Brahmadatta, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin then forgave him. 
When the Blessed One spoke thus, King Brahmadatta, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas all rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One. 
Here ends the noble Mahāyāna sūtra “The Questions of Brahmadatta.”
It was translated, edited, and finalized by the Indian preceptors Surendrabodhi and Prajñāvarman, as well as the editor and translator Bandé Yeshé Dé and others. 
It consists of three hundred stanzas.
