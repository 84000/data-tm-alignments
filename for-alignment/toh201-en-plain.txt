The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
The Seal of Engagement in Awakening the Power of Faith
 Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in an abode of the thus-gone ones, a secluded Dharma hermitage, a luminous mansion. This mansion had amassed gatherings of ornaments of great merit. It was beyond reproach, possessed boundless qualities, and was built as solid as vajra. The indestructible ground was ornamented with flowers studded with every type of precious gem and decorated with a lattice of jewels that shone immaculately. A vast ocean of precious gems of myriad colors glimmered brilliantly; it was made up of the kings of precious gems that rained down in an unceasing shower.  There were rivers swirling with a variety of flowers with jeweled stems and branches. The land was arrayed with webs of every kind of flower, incense, and gemstone. Resplendent with all these adornments, this environment had been emanated by the blessings of the Buddha. 
It was a vast seat of awakening, pure and adorned with an immense amount of gold and jewels in every direction. Its vast mass was adorned with beryl gemstones and encircled by a ring made of the king of precious gems. It was decorated with heaps of precious pearls, and arrayed with parasols, victory banners, flags on poles, and canopies made of a lattice of large and small bells. It was perfumed with uragasāra sandalwood, covered in precious wish-fulfilling gemstones, arrayed as a pure oceanic abode, filled with a network of luminous pillars of jewels, and overlaid with planks made of precious “lion’s mane” jewels. This mansion was adorned with vestibules made of precious “lion’s banner” jewels, architraves, and windows, and decorated with tufts of silk. There were also many scattered flowers of various types: mandārava, mahāmandārava, mañjuṣaka, mahāmañjuṣaka, roca, mahāroca, cakra, mahācakra, jasmine, agarwood, aloe, valla aloe, surabhi, dhanuṣkārika, ravishing divine blue lotus flowers, pink lotuses,  water lilies, and white lotuses, and other large flowers. 
On a lion throne at the center of this arrangement sat the Blessed One, unattached and with utterly pure mind. He was without duplicity in his behavior and entirely immersed in the Dharma free of characteristics. He was grounded in the way of the buddhas and had attained a level on a par with all buddhas. As he had no obscurations, he had achieved realization. He possessed the qualities of non-regression and his domain was inalienable. He rested in an inconceivable manner. He had reached the full measure of the equality of the three times. He had a body that pervaded every universe. He possessed wisdom that harbored no doubts about anything, and intelligence regarding every behavior. He had no uncertainty about awakened wisdom and possessed a non-conceptual body. He had genuinely perfected the wisdom of all bodhisattvas. He had reached the true transcendence of the non-dual way of the buddhas. He had brought to culmination the unshared liberating wisdom of the thus-gone ones. He had comprehended the equality of the state of buddhahood that is without center or periphery. He was as limitless as the realm of phenomena. He had gone to the limit of space. Through spontaneous wisdom, all of his awakened activities unfolded unceasingly. He blessed all the numerous future eons with the turning of the Dharma wheel of non-regression. He demonstrated the essential, boundless display. He possessed boundless wisdom. He never parted from, nor dwelled in, the knowledge that is supreme in every respect. He was skilled in displaying, simultaneously within all the infinite universes, the processes of dwelling in the supreme Heaven of Joy, dying and passing on, being born, departing, practicing austerities, going to the seat of awakening, vanquishing the demons,  fully awakening, turning the wheel of Dharma, and passing into parinirvāṇa, as well as the remaining and eventual waning of the Dharma.
Moreover, all of the assembled bodhisattva great beings, as numerous as the atoms in all the ineffably, inexpressibly many trillions of buddha realms, were sporting in the absorption of the heroic progress. They attained a form that actualized the perfection of limitless bodily hues. They were skilled in displaying the emergence of a buddha in worlds where otherwise there were none. Each one of them had purified the defiled worlds. Together with them was an unfathomable, countless number of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakras, Brahmās, world protectors, humans, and non-human beings.
Then Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together he bowed toward the Blessed One and requested him, “Will the Blessed One please teach the ways of gaining inspiration, which prepares one for the first bodhisattva level?”
The Blessed One replied to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, “Mañjuśrī, there are five ways to gain inspiration that prepares one for the first bodhisattva level. What are the five, you may ask? They are as follows. 
“(1) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by a motivation, thereby inspiring others toward that motivation.’ In this case, motivation means to have undivided trust in specific aspects of the different roots of virtue undertaken. 
“(2) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by a higher motivation, thereby inspiring others toward such motivation.’ In this case, higher motivation means to focus intensively on the qualities that distinguish the Buddha’s greatness. 
“(3) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by trust, thereby inspiring others toward such trust.’ In this case trust means to be involved in actions that stem from the root of insight. 
“(4) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by sublime joy, thereby inspiring others toward such joy.’ In this case, sublime joy means to have thoroughly purified body and mind. 
“(5) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by buddha activity—which is no different from demonic activity—thereby inspiring others toward buddha activity, which is no different from demonic activity.’ In this case, demonic activity refers to any viewpoint that arises due to error, as well as the demonic actions that arise due to such a viewpoint.

“(1) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the fact that wisdom neither eradicates nor maintains afflictions, thereby inducing in others the fact that wisdom neither eradicates nor maintains afflictions.’ Why? Because the nature of afflictions is nothing other than wisdom. Since there is no other wisdom than the nature of the afflictions, the nature of the afflictions is wisdom.

“(2) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the dictum that all phenomena are permanent, thereby inspiring others with the dictum that all phenomena are permanent.’ In this case, all phenomena are permanent because there is no middle and no extremes. All phenomena have no middle or extremes because this is nothing other than the nature of conditioned phenomena. Since there is no absence of middle and extremes other than the nature of conditioned phenomena, the nature of conditioned phenomena is the absence of middle and extremes. That which is devoid of middle and extremes is permanent, stable, and eternal.
“(3) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the preeminent practice of making offerings to the Buddha, thereby inspiring others toward the preeminent practice of making offerings to the Buddha.’  In this case, the preeminent practice of making offerings to the Buddha means to follow and apprentice oneself to bodhisattvas who are devoted to the Great Vehicle, to serve them, give them wealth, and venerate them.

“(5) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the fact that all phenomena are empty, thereby inducing in others the fact that all phenomena are empty.’ In this case, emptiness is a reference to views. Why? Because emptiness is nothing other than the nature of views. Therefore, since there is no other nature of views than emptiness, emptiness is the nature of views. By recognizing that the nature of views is emptiness, it is known that all phenomena are empty.
“Mañjuśrī, these five ways of finding inspiration prepare one for the first bodhisattva level.
“Mañjuśrī, there are also five other ways of finding inspiration that prepare one for the first bodhisattva level. What are the five, you may ask? 
“(1) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the difficulty in perceiving all phenomena, thereby inspiring others about the difficulty in perceiving all phenomena.’ In this case, the difficulty in perceiving all phenomena is due to the nature of causes and conditions. 
“(2) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the difficulty in realizing all phenomena, thereby inspiring others about the difficulty in realizing all phenomena.’ In this case, the difficulty in realizing all phenomena is due to the fact that their nature cannot be observed or brought to mind.
“(3) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the difficulty in knowing all phenomena, thereby inspiring others about the difficulty in knowing all phenomena.’ In this case, the difficulty in knowing all phenomena is due to the realization that knowledge and the objects of knowledge are the same.

“(5) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the inexhaustibility of all phenomena, thereby inspiring others about the inexhaustibility of all phenomena. In this case, all phenomena are inexhaustible because they have no essence to use as an analogy or referent. 
“Mañjuśrī, these five ways of finding inspiration prepare one for the first bodhisattva level.
“Mañjuśrī, there are also five other ways of finding inspiration that prepare one for the first bodhisattva level. What are the five, you may ask? 
“(1) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the indivisibility of all phenomena, thereby inspiring others about the indivisibility of all phenomena.’ In this case, the indivisibility of phenomena refers to engaging in the equality of the three times with the realization that all phenomena are inseparable from the realm of phenomena.
“(2) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the indivisibility of the four truths of the noble ones, thereby inspiring others about the indivisibility of the four truths of the noble ones.’ In this case, the indivisibility of the four truths of the noble ones refers to inner purity. 
“(3) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by understanding the indivisibility of ignorance and formations, thereby inspiring others to understand the indivisibility of ignorance and formations.’ Why? Because ignorance is nothing other than the nature of formations. If ignorance were something other than formations, formations would be causeless. However, since formations are nothing other than ignorance, they are utterly pure. Thus, they are related as cause and effect. 
“(4) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the impermanence of all phenomena, thereby inspiring others about the impermanence of all phenomena.’ Why? Because impermanence is nothing other than the nature of permanence. Therefore, since impermanence is nothing other than the nature of permanence, the nature of permanence is impermanence.
“(5) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the fact that the Thus-Gone One does not arise or cease, thereby inspiring others about the fact that the Thus-Gone One does not arise or cease.’ In this case, it is said the Thus-Gone One does not arise or cease because there is nothing to contradict it. For instance, while space surely does not arise or cease, and has no center or periphery, we nevertheless conceptualize it as being small, medium, or vast. In this way we say, ‘This is the eye of a needle,’ ‘This is the interior of a vase,’ or ‘The sky is immeasurable.’ Nonetheless, because it is beyond arising and ceasing, space itself is not subject to any such categories. And while space surely has no thoughts or concepts, it nonetheless has unique qualities that allow it to function spontaneously and without thought. 
“Mañjuśrī, in the same way, while the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, does not arise or cease, and has no center or periphery, beings nevertheless form concepts such as ‘small,’ ‘medium,’ and ‘vast.’  In this way distinctions are made such as, ‘This is the Vehicle of Hearers. This is the Vehicle of Solitary Buddhas. This is the Great Vehicle that is available to all beings.’ While the Thus-Gone One indeed has no thoughts or concepts, he nonetheless has unique qualities that allow him to function spontaneously and without thought.
“Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of sunlight. Due to location and perspective, there can be a variety of different types of shade. However, since sunlight has unique qualities, it shines without thoughts or concepts. In the same way, Mañjuśrī, due to the various ideas and perspectives of sentient beings, several types of wisdom of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, come about. While the Thus-Gone One himself has no thoughts or concepts, he nonetheless has unique qualities that allow him to function spontaneously and without thought. In this sense, there is no such thing as vehicle or non-vehicle.

“(3) One can find inspiration by thinking, “I will live by insight concerning the gateways that illuminate wisdom, thereby inspiring others about insight concerning the gateways that illuminate wisdom.’ Mañjuśrī, insight concerning the gateways that illuminate wisdom comes about through four factors. Which four, you may ask? The accumulation of merit, the accumulation of wisdom, devotion to emptiness, and inducing the mind of awakening in others. Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattvas’ insight concerning the gateways that illuminate wisdom comes about through these four factors.

“(4) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by insight immersed in the inexhaustible spirit of generosity, thereby inspiring others about the insight immersed in the inexhaustible spirit of generosity.’ In this case, Mañjuśrī, insight immersed in the inexhaustible spirit of generosity is what enables bodhisattvas to bring miserly beings to maturity.
“(5) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by insight immersed in the inexhaustible spirit of discipline, thereby inspiring others about insight immersed in the inexhaustible spirit of discipline.’ In this case, Mañjuśrī, insight immersed in the inexhaustible spirit of discipline is what enables bodhisattvas to bring beings with faulty discipline to maturity.

To relate in this way is called ‘the intrinsic nature of the conditioned.’
“(3) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the nature of the unconditioned, thereby inspiring others toward the nature of the unconditioned.’ In this case, the nature of the unconditioned means that one does not divide, reify, conceptualize, or form thoughts about such phenomena.
“(4) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by correct perception, thereby inspiring others toward correct perception.’ In this case, correct perception means to relate to things without the characteristics of dual or nondual.

Similarly, Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas’ activity takes on a broad spectrum of different colors on account of the beings who are to be brought to maturity. While the thus-gone ones indeed have no thoughts or concepts, they nonetheless possess unique qualities, and therefore such activity unfolds. This, Mañjuśrī, is the unimpeded display of the blessed buddhas.
“Mañjuśrī, about the thus-gone ones’ unimpeded knowledge: they have unimpeded knowledge that penetrates every world-system, continent, and every atom throughout the infinite universes in the ten directions— it encompasses each and every particle in the ocean-like quantity of universes. In a single instant, within each atom in every continent in every world, they have unimpeded knowledge of the various ways of showing the individual instances of the boundless, ocean-like accumulation of merit, of which there are as many as there are atoms in every realm.

“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. When beings make many noises in a cave, the echoes that ensue will continue to reverberate endlessly. While an echo in fact has no thoughts or concepts, it nonetheless has unique qualities that allow this to happen, non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones are able to dispense their teachings in languages that accords with beings’ wishes and the proper way of guidance. The thus-gone ones indeed have no thoughts or concepts, and yet, because they possess unique qualities, such activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ unimpeded knowledge. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity. A thus-gone one’s uṣṇīṣa fills space throughout every continent in every world-system in all the infinite universes in the ten directions,  in a way that is unhindered, unobstructed, and indivisible. As thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity, they remain until the end of the eon. Mañjuśrī, the Thus-gone One’s hair-coils fills space throughout every continent in every world-system in all the infinite universes in the ten directions, in a way that is unhindered, unobstructed, and indivisible. As thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity, they remain until the end of the eon. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, each of the Thus-gone One’s major marks fills space throughout every continent in every world-system in all the infinite universes in the ten directions, in a way that is unhindered, unobstructed, and indivisible. As thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity, they remain until the end of the eon. In the same way, the Thus-gone One’s excellent signs fill space throughout every continent in every world-system in all the infinite universes in the ten directions, in a way that is unhindered, unobstructed, and indivisible. As thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity, they remain until the end of the eon.

As thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity, they remain until the end of the eon. Why? Because they possess unique qualities. They possess unique qualities because they are blessed with the power of aspiration. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the way the thus-gone ones are foremost in bringing beings to maturity. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon. 
“Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones’ manifestations are extremely numerous: there is an ocean-like quantity of bodhisattvas in every part of every atom of every continent of every world-system in every one of the infinite universes throughout the ten directions. Say there are as many world-systems as there are atoms in fifty world-systems. The atoms in this innumerable ocean-like quantity of world-systems would still be much fewer than the thus-gone ones’ manifestations. These bodhisattvas manifest unimpededly and unobstructedly—acting later just as they did before—among all sentient beings and all worlds; continents; mountains such as Meru, Mahāmeru, Cakravāla, and Mahācakravāla; villages; cities; towns; countries; kingdoms; royal palaces; waterfalls; ponds; and pools. They are able to do this because the thus-gone ones possess unique qualities. Various beings—whether gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharva, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahma, world protectors, humans, non-humans, or bodhisattvas— can directly see the thus-gone ones present right in front of them precisely in accord with their particular inclinations and ways of being guided.  Why? Because they possess the unique qualities.
“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. At midnight on the night of the fifteenth day of the waxing moon, all the world’s men, women, boys, and girls can behold the orb of the moon right there before them. The orb of the moon has no thoughts or concepts, and yet it possesses unique qualities that enable this to happen, non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similar to this, Mañjuśrī, are the thus-gone ones. The beings in all the infinite universes in the ten directions—with their particular wishes and ways of being guided—can behold the thus-gone ones present before them. While the thus-gone ones indeed have no thoughts or concepts, they nonetheless possess unique qualities, and so their activity unfolds in this way, non-conceptually and spontaneously. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ manifestations. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones are undaunted by the task of purifying buddha realms. The thus-gone ones enter into each atom in every world-system throughout all the infinite universes in the ten directions—they enter into an ocean-like quantity of world-systems, as many as there are atoms in every universe. Certain of these ocean-like quantities of world-systems they purify with the wisdom that specifically shows the incalculable, ocean-like accumulation of merit.

It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.

“The thus-gone ones have no thoughts or concepts. Why? Because they have achieved spontaneous wisdom. Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of the sun’s orb, which appears in any bowl filled with pure and stainless water. The orb of the sun has no thoughts or concepts, and yet it has unique qualities that enable this to take place non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, beings on all the continents in all the worlds in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions—no matter their hopes or ways of being guided—can simultaneously behold the Thus-gone One. The thus-gone ones have no thoughts or concepts, and yet they have the unique quality of unhindered bodies, and so this sort of activity unfolds non-conceptually and spontaneously. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ infinite bodies. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon. 
“Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones’ objects must be described by means of analogy. Why? Because when a learned being uses analogies, the meaning can be grasped. So consider this analogy, Mañjuśrī. Imagine a lake 500,000 leagues across where birds come to drink. It has equal proportions on all sides and is covered in lotus petals. On that lake there is someone speedily driving an iron chariot that has thousand-spoked wheels and is pulled by an extraordinary horse that can run faster than a garuḍa can fly. As the fast chariot rolls along its wheels do not touch the water, nor do the horse’s hooves damage the lotus petals.  Then as this chariot is speeding along, a venomous snake emerges from the great lake and in a single moment it circles the chariot ten times. Mañjuśrī, in the same amount of time that the venomous snake takes to circle the chariot once, the monk Ānanda can expound on—and cause others to understand—ten Dharma topics. In the same time that it takes the monk Ānanda to teach one Dharma topic, the monk Śāriputra is able to teach—and cause understanding of—one thousand Dharma topics. In the same time that it takes the monk Śāriputra to teach one Dharma topic, the elder Maudgalyāyana can travel beyond eighty thousand world-systems. In the same time that it takes the elder Maudgalyāyana to travel beyond one world-system, the Thus-Gone One is able to demonstrate—on every continent in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions—dwelling in and descending from the Heaven of Joy, being born, departing, practicing austerities, endeavoring, going to the seat of awakening, taming the demons, fully awakening, turning the wheel of Dharma, displaying the great passing of nirvāṇa, and the persistence and eventual disappearance of the Dharma. He appears simultaneously in all his lives, including those where he practices among people living in non-Buddhist communities. Why? Because he is inseparable from unimpeded knowledge and unimpeded vision, as well as from the non-abiding state. 
“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. With the aid of other implements, an infinite variety of activities can be performed with a precious beryl gem. While the beryl itself has no thoughts or concepts, it nonetheless has certain unique qualities that allow such things to happen, non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, in a single moment in time, in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions, an immeasurable amount of activities unfold from the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas,  due to the act of bringing others to maturation. All the while though, the thus-gone ones have no thoughts or concepts, and yet such non-conceptual and spontaneous activity unfolds because of their unique qualities. 
“Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of the orbs of the moon and sun, which can simultaneously appear in any bowl filled with pure and stainless water in the world, without moving from their abodes. In a similar way, in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions, pure and stainless beings—in accordance with their wishes and in the particular way they are to be guided—are able to behold the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha. The Thus-Gone One himself indeed does not part from the Heaven of Joy, and yet he appears to be carrying out activities in all the world-systems throughout the ten directions. Why? Because he has achieved unwavering wisdom.
“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. Due to the ripening of superior, medium, or lesser karma, beings develop formations of a superior, medium, or lesser type. The formations themselves have no thoughts or concepts, and yet their unique qualities allow for such things to occur non-conceptually and spontaneously. In a similar way, due to the ripening of lesser, medium, or superior karma, any being might see the Thus-Gone One in a lesser, medium, or superior way. While the Thus-Gone One himself has no thoughts or concepts, he nonetheless has unique qualities that allow for such activity to unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. 
“Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of the rain that falls uniformly from clouds.  As it descends it takes on various colors and scents due to the specific things it touches. The clouds have no thoughts or concepts, and yet their unique qualities make all of this occur non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, the Thus-gone One’s realm of phenomena is uniform, and yet this realm of phenomena appears differently due to the process of bringing beings to maturity. The Thus-gone One has no thoughts or concepts and yet, due to his unique qualities, such activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously.
“Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of the precious vaśirāja gem. Wherever it might appear, there is no iron, nor anything made of iron. Why? Because it possesses unique qualities. In the same way, Mañjuśrī, wherever the Thus-gone One resides, there will not be any light from fires, lightning, the sun, or jewels. There will be no light from gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, or world protectors. Royal decrees will not apply there. The four castes will not exist. No one will be born in an unfree state. No one will be born as hell beings, animals, hungry spirits, or in the realm of the Lord of Death. There will be no paths of the ten unwholesome actions. There will be no afflictions. There will be no quarrels. There will be no rival communities such as the carakas, parivrājakas, nirgranthas, and ājīvikas. The thus-gone ones indeed have no thoughts or concepts, and yet since they have unique qualities and are not attached to objects,  such activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ objects. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Next, Mañjuśrī, is the thus-gone ones’ spontaneous wisdom. Mañjuśrī, take an ocean-like quantity of world-systems—as many as there are atoms in fifty world-systems. All atoms there would be far fewer than the much greater amount of the thus gone ones’ form bodies—with all their colors, ways of being, and manifestations—occurring simultaneously moment by moment in every continent of every world-system throughout the ten directions. Why? Because they possess unique qualities.
“Mañjuśrī, take an ocean-like quantity of world-systems—as many as there are atoms in fifty world-systems. All atoms there would be far fewer than the much greater amount of the thus-gone ones’ spontaneous wisdom endeavors to instill in other beings the roots of virtue and all the fields of work and craftsmanship, which occur on every continent in every world-system throughout the ten directions. The thus-gone ones have no thoughts or concepts, and yet they possess unique qualities, so all this activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. 
“Mañjuśrī, all the activities that unfold in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions—both mundane and supramundane, including those in all the abodes of rival communities—occur due to the thus-gone ones’ spontaneous wisdom. Why? Because they possess unique qualities. 
“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. Based on the earth and in dependence on the earth every seed, blade of grass, shrub, herb, and tree can grow, develop, and flourish. The earth has no thoughts or concepts,  and yet it possesses unique qualities that allow for such things to unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, based on the thus-gone ones, and in dependence on the thus-gone ones, the roots of virtue of all beings in every universe throughout the ten directions—both mundane and supramundane, and even those of rival communities, such as the carakas, parivrājakas, and nirgranthas—can grow, develop, and flourish. The thus-gone ones indeed have no thoughts or concepts, and yet due to their unique qualities such activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. 
“Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of pain medicine, which can soothe all the ailments of those who acquire it. The pain medicine has no thoughts or concepts, and yet it possesses unique qualities, and so this can happen non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, even touching a picture of the Thus-gone One, or a volume of teachings, can be the cause for soothing the pain of all afflictions such as desire, anger, and ignorance. The thus-gone ones indeed have no thoughts or concepts, and yet they possess unique qualities, and so such activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. 
“Mañjuśrī, consider the analogy of the king of gems, the wish-fulfilling jewel, which can fulfill all the wishes of every being. The precious wish-fulfilling jewel has no thoughts or concepts, yet it possesses unique qualities, thus all of this can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, gods, humans, asuras, and bodhisattvas who long for Dharma teachings  will seek out the thus-gone ones and hear such Dharma teachings from them. The thus-gone ones have no thoughts or concepts, yet they possess unique qualities, and so such activity can unfold non-conceptually and spontaneously. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ spontaneous wisdom. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, next is the thus-gone ones’ quality of being inconceivable. Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones manifest in every atom in every world-system in all the infinite universes throughout the ten directions—in an amount of world-systems that is the same as the amount of atoms in every world-system. Take, for comparison, the atoms of every continent, in every world-system of five hundred sextillion ocean-like universes. These would still be much fewer than the far more numerous, boundless, ocean-like quantity of unique demonstrations by the thus-gone ones of the ways to accumulate merit. These demonstrations transcend classification; arise unimpededly, unobstructedly, and identically, moment by moment; expansively pervade the entirety of space; and remain until the end of the eon. Similar to this is the boundless, ocean-like quantity of unique demonstrations of the various accumulations of wisdom, which transcend classification; arise unimpededly, unobstructedly, and identically, moment by moment; expansively pervade the entirety of space; and remain until the end of the eon.

“Mañjuśrī, the entire ocean of the world-systems that have existed in the past, exist now, or will exist in the future—in all the infinite universes throughout the ten directions—is formed and then annihilated within the individual pores of the thus-gone ones. Why? Because they have discovered reality beyond center or periphery. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ inconceivability. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, next is the thus-gone ones’ quality of being all-seeing. The thus-gone ones can see all beings in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions as they die and pass on, take birth, migrate to blissful states, or migrate to lower states. They can also see all of this with their uṣṇīṣa, as well as with their hair coil, with each of their major marks, with each of their excellent signs, and with each pore of their skin. Moreover, they can see all beings in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions as they die and pass on, take birth, migrate to blissful states, or migrate to lower states— all this in a single instant. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ quality of being all-seeing. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, next is the thus-gone ones’ renown.  Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones pervade every atom, every continent, and every world-system in all the infinite universes throughout the ten directions—in an ocean-like amount of world-systems equal to the amount of atoms in all world-systems. In a single moment of mind, on each continent in every world-system, they have an amount of manifestations that equals the number of atoms in every world-system, which they unfold unimpededly, unobstructedly, and identically, to expansively pervade the entirety of space. In order to bring beings to maturity, these manifestations remain until the end of the eon due to their unique qualities. Similarly, an amount of manifestations equal to the number of atoms in all world-systems—including manifestations of realms, the Dharma, bodies, aspirations, domains, wisdoms, super-knowledges, miracles, and powers—unfold unimpededly, unobstructedly, and identically, moment by moment, expansively pervading the entirety of space. In order to bring beings to maturity, they remain until the end of the eon. Why? Because they possess unique qualities. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ renown. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, next is the thus-gone ones’ quality of being indivisible and non-abiding. Mañjuśrī, the Thus-gone One is separate from this world-system, and yet does not abide in another world-system. The Thus-gone One is separate from this continent, and yet does not abide in another continent. The Thus-gone One is separate from this home, and yet does not abide in another home.  The Thus-gone One is separate from this class of gods, and yet does not abide in another class of gods. The Thus-gone One is separate from this birth in the state of an animal, and yet does not abide in another animal state. The Thus-gone One is separate from this existence as a hungry spirit, and yet does not abide in another existence of a hungry spirit. The Thus-gone One is separate from this existence as a hell being, and yet does not abide in another existence of a hell being. The Thus-gone One is separate from the desire realm, and yet does not abide in the form realm. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ quality of being indivisible and non-abiding. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, regarding how the thus-gone ones’ bodies are unimpeded: it may be possible that there could be an end to space within the buddha realms among the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions. However, you will never find an end to the Victorious One’s uṣṇīṣa—a place where it appears to arise or cease—anywhere in any of the infinite directions throughout the three times. Similarly, while it may be possible that there could be an end to space, you will never find an end to the Victorious One’s hair coil, to any of his major marks, to any of his excellent signs, or to any of his pores. 
“Gods, humans, and bodhisattvas perceive the Dharma teachings as unfolding in precisely the way that they are to be guided. For instance, certain gods, humans, and bodhisattvas might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like accumulation of merit emerging from the uṣṇīṣa. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like accumulation of wisdom. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like perfections.  Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like levels. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like dhāraṇīs. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like absorptions. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like liberations. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like correct understandings. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like super-knowledges. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like aspirations. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like ways of engendering discipline. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like ways of finding inspiration. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like entrances into the state of a bodhisattva. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like entrances into the state of the thus-gone. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like ways of engaging with beings’ intentions and actions. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like entrances into world-systems. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like entrances into eons. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like entrances into the three times. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like displays of the three times. Others might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like ways of arousing indefatigable resolve. 
“Certain gods, humans, and bodhisattvas  might perceive a specific teaching on the boundless, ocean-like inseparable wisdom emerging from the uṣṇīṣa. Similarly, in any given moment of mind, gods, humans, and bodhisattvas might perceive—precisely in accord with their wishes and ways of being guided—an ocean-like variety of specific Dharma teachings emerging from the hair coil, from each of the major marks, from each of the excellent signs, or from each pore. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the thus-gone ones’ unimpeded body. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, next is the thus-gone ones’ invisible crown. Mañjuśrī, take an ocean-like quantity of world-systems—as many as there are atoms in fifty world-systems. The amount of atoms in all those world-systems would still be far fewer than the thus gone ones’ far greater ocean-like assembly of bodhisattvas. Some of those bodhisattvas measure a league in height. Other bodhisattvas measure ten, twenty, thirty, or forty leagues in height. Certain other bodhisattvas measure one hundred leagues in height, while others measure one thousand, two thousand, three thousand, or four thousand leagues in height. Some bodhisattvas in the retinue measure one thousand leagues in height, while others in the retinue measure ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand, forty thousand, or fifty thousand leagues in height. Certain bodhisattvas measure ten million leagues in height, while other bodhisattvas measure one hundred million, two hundred million, three hundred million, four hundred million, or five hundred million leagues in height. Some bodhisattvas measure one billion leagues in height. Other bodhisattvas measure ten billion leagues in height,  while there are still other bodhisattvas who measure one hundred billion, two hundred billion, three hundred billion, four hundred billion, or five hundred billion leagues in height. On every continent in all of the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions, all of them simultaneously see the Thus-gone One as double their own size. 
“Mañjuśrī, say that in one moment of mind, a bodhisattva who dwells in inconceivable liberation, seeking the crown of the Thus-gone One’s head, were to walk upward the amount of steps that there are atoms in fifty world-systems. Say, moreover, that with each step he traveled the distance of an ocean-like quantity of world-systems, the same amount as there are atoms in fifty world-systems. And say as well that he traveled for an ocean-like quantity of eons, the same as there are atoms in fifty world-systems. Still he would see the Thus-gone One as double that distance. Why? Because the Thus-gone One possesses unique qualities. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of how the crown of the Thus-gone One’s head is invisible. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, next is the abodes where the thus-gone ones bring beings to maturity. Mañjuśrī, take all the atoms in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions. These would still be far fewer than the much more numerous abodes where the thus-gone ones bring beings to maturity within every atom, on every continent, and in every world-system. Mañjuśrī, as many abodes as there are where the thus-gone ones bring beings to maturity—in every atom, on every continent, and in every world-system—the ocean-like quantity of light rays that are emitted from the Thus-gone One’s body proclaiming the bodhisattva conduct are still far more. In each moment of mind, an ocean-like quantity of light rays, as many as there are atoms in all realms, are emitted from the Thus-gone One’s uṣṇīṣa and hair coil, as well as from each of his major marks,  excellent signs, and pores of his skin. A portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like accumulation of merit. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like accumulation of wisdom. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like perfections. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like levels. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like absorptions. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like liberations.

Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like ways of engendering diligence. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like ways of finding inspiration. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like entrances into the state of a bodhisattva. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like entrances into the state of the thus-gone. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like ways of engaging with beings’ intentions and actions. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like entrances into world-systems. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like entrances into eons. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like entrances into the three times. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like displays of the three times. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless, ocean-like ways of arousing indefatigable resolve. Another portion of this ocean-like quantity of light rays proclaims the boundless ocean of various wisdoms.  All of these arise unimpededly, unobstructedly, and identically, expansively pervade the entirety of space, and remain until the end of the eon. Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the abodes where the thus-gone ones bring beings to maturity. They could not be described in all their detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Next, Mañjuśrī, is the way that the thus-gone ones are fearless in bringing beings to maturity. Mañjuśrī, in each moment, in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions, the thus-gone ones instantaneously bring an ocean-like quantity of beings, as many as there are atoms in every realm, to maturity within a single particle. Among this ocean-like quantity of beings, some are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various accumulations of merit. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various accumulations of wisdom. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various perfections. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various levels. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various dhāraṇīs. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various absorptions.

Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various entrances into the state of the thus-gone. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various ways of engaging with beings’ intentions and actions. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various entrances into world-systems. Other beings among this ocean-like quantity are brought to maturity through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of the various entrances into eons. Similarly, other beings are brought to maturity through the inseparable wisdoms related to the various entrances into the three times, the displays of the three times, and the ways of arousing indefatigable resolve. Moreover, an ocean-like quantity of beings, as many as there are atoms in all realms, is instantaneously brought to maturity within a single particle through the wisdom that specifically expresses the boundless ocean of wisdoms that manifest in the form of emanated beings, emanated realms, emanated Dharma, emanated bodies, emanated aspirations, emanated domains, emanated wisdoms, emanated super-knowledges, emanated miracles, and emanated powers.  Mañjuśrī, this was an overview of the way the thus-gone ones are fearless in bringing beings to maturity. It could not be described in all its detail even if we remained until the end of the eon.
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family, on a daily basis for an ocean-like span of eons numbering the same amount as sand in the Ganges, gave flavorful, divine food as well as divine garments to as many beings as there are atoms in every world-system. Compared to that, say that another son or daughter of noble family offered a single meal to a layperson, who follows the path of the ten wholesome deeds without relying on any other teacher, thinking, ‘This layperson trains in the practices of the blessed Buddha.’ The latter would create incalculably greater merit than the former.

“Conversely, the opposite could also be said about disrespectfully carrying out non-virtuous actions. This applies to those who ‘ride ox-carts,’ those who ‘ride goat-carts,’ those who ‘ride elephant-carts,’ those who ‘ride sun and moon-carts,’ and those who ‘proceed due to the miraculous powers of the hearers.’ Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family made an obstacle for the roots of virtue of as many bodhisattvas who ‘proceed due to the miraculous powers of the hearers’ as there are atoms in every world-system. Mañjuśrī, suppose that another son or daughter of noble family made an obstacle for one bodhisattva who ‘proceeds due to the miraculous powers of the Thus-gone One’—even for a root of virtue associated with rebirth as an animal—with an angry and abusive attitude. The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former.
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family plucked out the eyes of as many beings as there are atoms in all the world-systems in the ten directions and then robbed them of all their possessions. Then say that another son or daughter of noble family developed an abusive attitude and then berated, spoke harshly to, or disturbed a bodhisattva. The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former. Mañjuśrī, if a son or daughter of noble family, for whatever reason, feels contempt for and criticizes a bodhisattva,  that non-virtuous action will result in him or her being reborn in the Great Howling Hell. There he or she will have a body that is five hundred leagues tall with five hundred heads. Each head will have five hundred mouths, each mouth will have five hundred tongues, and each tongue will be plowed by five hundred plows. 
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family were to strike every being born in all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm with sticks and weapons and then rob them of all their possessions. Then say that another son or daughter of noble family developed a critical attitude and then became angry, malicious, harsh, and furious toward a bodhisattva. The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former. 
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family became aggressive and wished to harm beings. Say, moreover, that he or she killed as many worthy ones as sand in the Ganges on each continent in every world-system, of which there were as many as there is sand in the Ganges. And say finally that he or she also destroyed as many stūpas—each made of jewels, and encircled by jewel shrines with parasols, victory banners, and divine pennants—as there are sands in the Ganges. Mañjuśrī, suppose that another son or daughter of noble family developed some exaggerated notions about the Great Vehicle of those bodhisattvas who are devoted to the Great Vehicle, and then with an attitude of contempt, for whatever reason, became angry, abused it, spoke unpleasantly about it, and deprecated it. The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former. Why? Because bodhisattvas are destined to become thus-gone ones— in that way the family line of the buddhas remains intact. Whoever denigrates a bodhisattva  forsakes the Dharma. There is no other Dharma besides the bodhisattvas who foster the Dharma in others; bodhisattvas are the Dharma. 
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family became angry and locked all beings in all the world-systems in the ten directions away in dark dungeons. Then say that another son or daughter of noble family became so angry as to turn his or her back on a bodhisattva and then say, ‘No one pay any attention to this horrible being!’ The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former.
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family robbed the possessions of every being in the world. Then say someone else disparaged any bodhisattva. The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former.
“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. Mount Meru, the king of mountains, is so tall, wide, and immense that it outshines every other mountain. It is radiant, clear, and brilliant. Similarly, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas with devotion to this discourse on the Dharma are tall, wide, and immense. They outshine all bodhisattvas who do not feel devotion toward this Dharma discourse, even if they are as numerous as the atoms in every world-system, and have accumulated roots of virtue that arise from the five perfections over the course of countless eons. Doing so, they are radiant, clear, and bright.
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family established every being in every world-system throughout the ten directions in the mind of awakening. Then say another son or daughter of noble family developed conviction in the basis for the absence of the aggregates. The latter would create incalculably more merit than the former. 
“Mañjuśrī,  say every being developed conviction in the basis for the absence of the aggregates. Then say that another son or daughter of noble family became devoted to this Dharma discourse, recorded it in writing, arranged to have it recorded in writing, recited it, arranged to have it recited, or even kept and venerated a written version of it, honoring it with candles, flowers, incense, fragrances, garlands, and perfumes. The latter would create incalculably more merit than the former.
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family destroyed the roots of virtue of the beings in every world-system throughout the ten directions who were following the Vehicle of the Hearers—including the immeasurable and innumerable roots of virtue that each one has as a follower of the Vehicle of the Hearers, as well as the roots of virtue that lead to becoming a universal monarch, and the roots of virtue that lead to rebirth in the god realms. Then say someone else destroyed one single root of virtue of a bodhisattva. In this case the latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former, so no need to mention someone abusing or speaking unpleasantly to a bodhisattva. 
“Mañjuśrī, say that a son or daughter of noble family demolished and incinerated as many stūpas as there are sands in the Ganges. Then say that another son or daughter of noble family developed a malicious, harsh, and angry state of mind, and then spoke abusively and unpleasantly toward a bodhisattva. The latter would create incalculably more negativity than the former. Why? Because bodhisattvas are destined to become the blessed buddhas, while stūpas—as well as everything pleasurable in the whole world and in all the divine existences—come from the buddhas.  Since buddhas themselves develop from bodhisattvas, to disrespect a bodhisattva is to disrespect every buddha. To respect a bodhisattva, then, is to respect every buddha. If you want to make the most unexcelled offering to all the buddhas, make offerings to the bodhisattvas.
“Mañjuśrī, say there was city where there resided a number of bodhisattvas as high as one billion, ten billion, one trillion, or an immeasurable and incalculable number. If they nonetheless did not have devotion to this Dharma discourse, they would create the karma for conflicts with the king, disturbances related to water, disturbances related to thieves and bandits, disturbances related to famine, disturbances related to fire, or disturbances related to barbarians. On the other hand, if in that city there were a bodhisattva who was devoted to this Dharma discourse, the associated karma would lead him or her not to be reborn in the abodes of immediate retribution for innumerable eons. The city, moreover, would be free of disturbance. However, it could happen that the karma of those bodhisattvas did not cause conflicts with the king, disturbances related to water, disturbances related to thieves and bandits, disturbances related to famine, disturbances related to fire, or disturbances related to barbarians. Still, if the bodhisattva devoted to this Dharma discourse had the karma to be reborn for countless eons in the hells, or as an animal, or a hungry spirit, such disturbances would in fact occur in that city. Why is that? It is because any karma that he or she might have to be reborn into immediate retribution for an inexpressible, incalculable number of eons, as well as the karma he or she might have to suffer through the lower realms for ten, twenty, or thirty eons, would be experienced already in this life.  Through such disturbances, that karma would be purified. Why? Because of the great amount of merit that he or she had accumulated.
“Mañjuśrī, consider this analogy. A pool filled with water of the eight qualities that is one hundred leagues in width would render safe even one thousand tulā units of poison. Why? Because of the immensity of the body of water. Similarly, although the karma of having to dwell among hell beings, animals, and hungry spirits for countless eons is immense, it would not ripen. Why not? Because of the great amount of merit that had been accumulated.”
After the Blessed One had spoken these words, the whole world, including the monks and the unfathomably innumerable bodhisattvas who had gathered there from all ten directions, as well as the gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said. 
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “The Seal of Engagement in Awakening the Power of Faith.”
