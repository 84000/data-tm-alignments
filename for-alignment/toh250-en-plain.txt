The Sūtra on
The Four Factors
 Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas! 
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Śrāvastī at Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, together with a great saṅgha of 1250 monks. 
At that time, the Blessed One addressed the monks in a voice that was steady, deep, harmonious, and far-reaching, saying, “Monks, there are four beliefs that a wise son of good family does not hold for as long as he lives. What are these four? 
“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that there is pleasure to be found in women.
“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that there is pleasure to be found at the court of the royal palace.
“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that he is attractive, handsome, good looking, and in good health.
“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that he is rich, wealthy, and has abundant resources.”
The Blessed One spoke these words. Once the Sugata had spoken in this way, he, the Teacher, also said the following: 
“How could it be right to depend on women? 
How could the royal palace ever be delightful? 
How could a bubble possess a solid core? 
How could one’s wealth possibly endure?
“Wealth is like a rushing river. 
A home is like a ferryboat. 
One’s body resembles a flower. 
Life itself is like a water bubble.”
When the Blessed One had said this, the monks, together with the world of devas, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One. 
This concludes “The Sūtra on the Four Factors.”
