The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on 
The Four Factors
 Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park, together with a great community of monks, consisting of 1,250 monks, and a great assembly of bodhisattvas. At that time, the Blessed One addressed the monks: 
“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon four factors even at the cost of their lives. What are these four? 
“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon the thought of awakening even at the cost of their lives.
“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon the spiritual friend even at the cost of their lives.
“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon tolerance and lenience even at the cost of their lives.
“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon dwelling in the wilderness even at the cost of their lives.
“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon these four factors even at the cost of their lives.”
The Blessed One spoke these words, and once the Sugata had spoken in this way, he, the Teacher, also said the following: 
“Let the wise conceive the thought of perfect awakening,
And not cast aside the thought of omniscience;
Let them maintain the strength of tolerance and lenience,
And never forsake the spiritual friend.
“If the wise, like the king of beasts, abandon fear, 
Always remain dwelling in the wilderness, 
And constantly maintain these factors,
They will conquer the māras and attain awakening.”
When the Blessed One had said this, the monks and bodhisattvas, together with the entire assembly, rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One. 
This concludes “The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on the Four Factors.”
