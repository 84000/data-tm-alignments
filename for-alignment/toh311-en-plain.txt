The Noble Sūtra
Teaching the Eleven Thoughts
 Homage to the Three Jewels.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Grove of Twin Sal Trees, in the city of Kuśinagarī in the country of the Mallas.
At the time of his parinirvāṇa, he spoke to the bhikṣus: “Bhikṣus, at the time of death you should bring to mind eleven thoughts. What are the eleven? You should bring to mind the thought of nonattachment to this life,  the thought of love for all beings, the thought of giving up all resentments, the thought of acknowledging all faulty moral discipline, the thought of undertaking the entirety of moral discipline, the thought that even great harms that have been caused are insignificant, the thought that small acts of virtue are significant, the thought of a lack of fright with respect to the next world, the thought that everything conditioned is impermanent, the thought that all phenomena lack a self, and the thought that nirvāṇa is peace.”
When the Blessed One had spoken thus, the bhikṣus rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said. 
This completes “Teaching the Eleven Thoughts,” the Blessed One’s final testament.
