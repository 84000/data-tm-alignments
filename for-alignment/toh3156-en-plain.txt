The Dhāraṇī of Siṃhanāda
namo ratna­trayāya | nama āryāvalokiteśvarāya bodhi­sattvāya mahā­sattvāya mahā­kāruṇikāya | tadyathā | oṁ akaṭe vikaṭe nikaṭe kaṭaṃkaṭe karoṭe karoṭavīrye svāhā ||
In the early morning, in front of the blessed, noble Lokeśvara, make eight maṇḍalas out of cow dung that has not fallen to the ground. Recite this thirteen times at each maṇḍala, then incant the resulting dung with the mantra seven times. Smear it on the sick person and all of their illnesses will be cured. 
If this is not successful after seven, thirteen, or twenty-one days, even if performed by someone who has carried out the five deeds of immediate retribution, then I myself will have carried out the five deeds of immediate retribution, and I will have deceived the blessed buddhas. 
This completes “The Dhāraṇī of Siṃhanāda.”
