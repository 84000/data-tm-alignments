The Sūtra of the Moon (2)
Homage to the Three Jewels!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on the bank of Traveler’s Pond in the country of Campā. At that time, the entire moon was covered by Rāhu, lord of the asuras. Then the god who dwells on the disk of the moon, frightened, terrified, and dismayed, approached the Blessed One, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet, and sat to one side. He then appealed to him in verse:
“I pay homage to you,
Thoroughly liberated, heroic Buddha! 
I am in distress. 
Please grant me refuge!
“Candramas took refuge 
In the Worthy One in the world, the Well-Gone One. 
Therefore, free the moon from Rāhu! 
Buddhas have compassion for the world.”
The Blessed One said:
“Rāhu! The moon dispels darkness.
Illuminating the sky,
It is radiant, 
Shining with white and pristine light.
Instead of seizing it in the sky,
Instantly release the lamp of beings!”
Then Rāhu, in a hurry, 
Covered in sweat, agitated, 
And confused like a sick person,
Released the moon.
When the great son of Virocana saw that Rāhu, lord of the asuras, had very swiftly released the moon, he asked him in verse:
“Why did you, Rāhu, 
Covered in sweat, agitated, 
And confused like a sick person,
Hurriedly release the moon?” 
Rāhu replied:
“As the Buddha uttered that verse, 
If I had not released the moon, 
My head would have split into seven pieces,
And even while alive I would not find happiness.”
The great son of Virocana exclaimed:
“Oh wonder! Amazing is the emergence of buddhas,
Who see peace!
If they utter a verse,
Rāhu will free the moon.”
This concludes “The Sūtra of the Moon.”
