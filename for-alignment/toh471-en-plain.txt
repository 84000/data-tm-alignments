The Myth Chapter
Homage to the glorious Vajrabhairava.
“Now, I will explain
How the great Vajrabhairava—
He who has emerged from the vajras
Of the Blessed One’s body, speech, and mind—
Crossed the southern ocean 
And reached the city of Yama.
“With his overwhelming sixteen legs
He trampled the sixteen gateless iron castles.
With his organ of single-pointed wisdom 
He pounded the great central iron castle.
“Once he gained victory over the great Māra,
He roared ha ha hi hi.
Yama Dharmarāja and the rest,
Feeling overwhelmed, said to him:
“ ‘Great hero, what is this? 
We will do whatever you require, hero.
We likewise offer our essential life forces.
Please accept them, hero.’
“The eight classes of beings also offered their essential life forces:
Yama offered ya, the mātṛsma,
The rākṣasas offered ra, the yakṣas kṣe,
The humans offered ṇi, the earth lords sa,
The tsen offered tsa, and the māras da.
“They came together as one
And promised to become his servants. 
Due to this great declaration,
They were well-regarded by the wisdom deity
And gained a profound experience of service.
“After they gained this experience of serving the deity,
They would never transgress their former oath 
And it became impossible for them to fail.
‘ya ma rā ja sa do me ya | ya me do ru ṇa yo da ya | ya da yo ni ra yakṣe ya | yakṣe yaccha ni rā ma ya’ 
“After saying this,
The great Vajrabhairava
Empowered Yama Dharmarāja
And all of Yama’s messengers
To become servants of liberation.
“To their mothers, sisters, daughters,
And their retinues, he gave this command:
“ ‘In the final five hundred years
During which my teachings appear,
You must correctly carry out activities
Of yogins and vidyādharas.’
They took this oath and were released from the oppression that afflicted them.
