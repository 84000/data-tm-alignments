The Dhāraṇī “Cloud of Offerings”
Homage to the Three Jewels. 
namo ratna trayāya| namo bhagavate| vajrasāra pramardani| tathāgatāya| arhate samyaksaṃ­buddhāya| tadyathā| oṃ vajre vajre| mahā­vajre| mahāteja­vajre| mahā­vidyāvajre| mahā­bodhi­citta­vajre| mahā­bodhi­maṇḍōpasaṃ­kramaṇa­vajre| sarva­karma āvaraṇa­viśodhana­vajre svāhā||
The rite for this dhāraṇī mantra is as follows. In the instant of recollecting it, one makes offerings to as many blessed buddhas who reside in the ten directions as there are coarse and subtle grains of sand in the river Gaṅga, and pays homage at their feet. These offerings are in the form of flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, scented unguents, powders, parasols, banners, pennants, seats, carpets, clothing, enjoyments, food, and so forth, as well as ornaments and flowing garments. One will be freed from all evil deeds and will possess every virtue. One will see all the buddhas and bodhisattvas and thereby be comforted. All the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, as well as the Lords of Secrets, such as Vajrapāṇi, as well as the Four Great Kings, will follow, protect, guard, and remain near to one. When one dies and transmigrates, one will be born in the realm of Sukhāvatī. If one has not accomplished these special qualities, they will be obtained with just a single recitation. 
This completes the dhāraṇī called “The Cloud of Offerings.”
