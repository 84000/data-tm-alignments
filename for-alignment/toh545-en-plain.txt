The Noble Dhāraṇī
Spoken by Mañjuśrī Himself
 Homage to the Three Jewels! Homage to noble Mañjuśrī!

As for the benefits of this dhāraṇī, even a single recitation will purify the karmic obscurations accrued over a thousand eons,  and at the time of death one will behold noble Mañjuśrī. One will also behold the body of noble Avalokiteśvara, his head adorned with a topknot. In short, the benefits of this dhāraṇī are limitless.
This concludes the noble dhāraṇī “Spoken by Mañjuśrī Himself.”
