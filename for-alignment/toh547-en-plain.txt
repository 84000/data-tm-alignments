The Dhāraṇī
Mañjuśrī’s Promise
namo mañjuśriye kumārabhūtāya bodhisattvāya mahāsattvāya mahākaruṇikāya || tadyathā | oṁ araje viraje | śuddhe viśuddhe | śodhani viśodhani | amale vimale | jaye vahini ru ru cale | hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ | phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ svāhā ||
Those who uphold, read aloud, or teach this dhāraṇī will obtain a keen intellect. If they chant it a single time, they will memorize a hundred dhāraṇīs, and every single one of the evil deeds they have accumulated over a thousand eons will be purified. If they recite it a hundred thousand times, they will become erudite in the five sciences. If they recite it two hundred thousand times,  they will retain in memory all the teachings they have heard. If they recite it three hundred thousand times, they will behold the body of Mañjuśrī.
This concludes the dhāraṇī “Mañjuśrī’s Promise.”
