The Noble Lord Mañjuśrī’s Dḥāraṇī for Increasing Insight and Intelligence
 Homage to the Three Jewels!
namo mañjuśriye kumārabhūtāya  || 
 tadyathā | oṁ araje viraje | śuddhe viśuddhe | śodhani  viśodhani | śodhaya viśodhaya | amale vimale | jayavati ru ru cale | hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ | phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ svāhā ||
Those who memorize this will become intelligent within one month. Their voice will be melodious. Their appearance will be beautiful. After a single reading they will turn their back on cyclic existence for a thousand eons. By merely holding it in their hands they will recall former lives. After a hundred thousand recitations they will become erudite. After two hundred thousand recitations they will become vidyādharas.  After three hundred thousand recitations they will behold the face of Mañjuśrī.
If one who has committed the five misdeeds with immediate retribution does not thus succeed, then may I myself become guilty of committing the five misdeeds with immediate retribution and of deceiving the blessed buddhas.
This concludes “The Noble Lord Mañjuśrī’s Dḥāraṇī for Increasing Insight and Intelligence.”
