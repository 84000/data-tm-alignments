The Eight Maidens’ Praise of Mañjuśrī, Lord of Speech
Possessor of youthful body, 
Adorned by the lamp of wisdom 
That removes the darkness of delusion from the world—
Homage to Mañjughoṣa.
Your flood of radiance
Outshines the full moon
And banishes ignorance—
Homage to Mañjuśrī. 
Upon whose topknot, uncreated and vivid,
Rests a form glittering with gems,
Whose body is a delight to all—
Homage to you, Mañjuśrī.
Like ambrosia, soft and deep,
The pleasing sound of your voice, 
O holy one, trove of Dharma jewels—
Homage and praise to you, Mañjuśrī. 
Countless as drops of water in the Ganges
Are the stains of affliction
You dispel in every world—
Homage and praise to you, Mañjuśrī.
Terrifying is your body’s manner
When, fangs bared in fearsome pose, 
You shatter the Lord of Death’s arrogance—
Homage and praise to you, Mañjuśrī.
You are beautified by a blue utpala
That is like your eyes in luster,
As you bear an alms bowl in your hand—
Homage to you, Mañjuśrī.
With immense offerings and praise
To the buddhas dwelling in the ten directions
We pay homage to you, Mañjuśrī,
Teacher of the path to liberation.
This concludes “The Eight Maidens’ Praise.”
