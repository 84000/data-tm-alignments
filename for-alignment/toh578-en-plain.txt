The Dhāraṇī of “The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines”
Homage to the Blessed Lady, the Mother Perfection of Wisdom.
tadyathā—oṃ hrīḥ śruti­smṛti­vijaye svāhā! prajñā­pāramitāyai sarva­durgati śodhaya rājāya svāhā!
By upholding this, one will have upheld The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines. It will block all kinds of negative omens. All karmic obscurations and unfavorable kinds of rebirth will be purified.
