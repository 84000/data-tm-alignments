The Dhāraṇī-Mantra to Have the Entire Noble “Sūtra of Descent into Laṅkā” Read
Homage to the noble Descent into Laṅkā.
“Mahāmati, I shall speak these mantra-words: 
tadyathā—padme padmadeve hine hine hine culu culu culu hule hule hule yule yule yule pale pale pale muñce chinde bhinde bhañje marde pramarde dinakare svāhā!
“Mahāmati! If any son of good family or daughter of good family upholds these mantra-words, retains them, recites them, and masters them, then no one will be able to find a weak point in them, be that a god or a goddess, a nāga or a nāgī, a yakṣa or a yakṣī, an asura or an asurī, a garuḍa or a garuḍī, a kinnara or a kinnarī, a mahoraga or a mahoragī, a gandharva or a gandharvī, a bhūta or a bhūtī, a kumbhāṇḍa or a kumbhāṇḍī, a piśāca or a piśācī, an ostārako or an ostārakī, an apasmāra or an apasmārī, a rākṣasa or a rākṣasī, a ḍāka or a ḍākī, an ojohāra or an ojohārī, a kaṭapūtana or a kaṭapūtanī, or a human man or a woman. One who recites these mantra-words will have recited the entire Sūtra of Descent into Laṅkā. The Blessed One taught these mantra-words so that rākṣasas and others will be kept at bay.”
