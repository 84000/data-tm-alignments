The Noble Dhāraṇī of
Dhvajāgrakeyūrā
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, sitting on the Pāṇḍukambala rock, when Śakra, lord of the gods, who had just lost in war against the asuras and had been completely defeated, rushed in distress to the Blessed One. He bowed his head down at the feet of the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, we fought with the asuras, and I have been vanquished by their king, Vemacitri, completely defeated, and all the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three were also routed. Blessed One, what should we do?”
The Blessed One replied, “Listen, lord of the gods, retain the unsurpassedDhāraṇī of Dhvajāgrakeyūrā. I received it from the Tathāgata Unsurpassed Standard when I was a bodhisattva, and then I explained it extensively to others. Recalling it, I have not experienced fear, anxiety, gooseflesh, or physical harm, even for an instant.” 
“Blessed One, what is the unsurpassed Dhāraṇī of Dhvajāgrakeyūrā?” 
The Blessed One replied:

King of the gods, with the unsurpassed Dhāraṇī of Dhvajāgrakeyūrā, whether in war, in fights, in quarrels, in disagreements, or wherever you go, you will never be afraid and will always be victorious. If it is tied atop a standard or worn around the neck, kings of humans and courageous ones will be protected. The dhāraṇī will take the appearance of a woman who will stand in front of them. She will eliminate their fears and protect them; she will produce excellent circumstances, make opposing armies retreat; and she will constantly bring about auspiciousness, purity, good reputation, prosperity, and abundance.” 
After the Blessed One had spoken, Śakra, lord of the gods, and the bhikṣus and bodhisattvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.
The Noble Dhāraṇī of Dhvajāgrakeyūrā is complete.
