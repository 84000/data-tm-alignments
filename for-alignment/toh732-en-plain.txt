When one has contracted a disease, the disease will be cured by reciting this mantra while bathing. If one takes medicine that has been incanted with this mantra, the illness will be cured. If one eats food that has been incanted with this mantra, one will not be harmed by poison. For those who are possessed by any kind of bhūtagraha, one should take a thread spun by a young girl, incant it with the mantra twenty-one times, and tie it to them. They will then be released.
