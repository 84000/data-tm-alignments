The Dhāraṇī
Vajra Conqueror
 Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was abiding in the vajra. Through the power of the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi consecrated his entire body as vajra and entered the vajra absorption. Then, through the power of the Buddha, the blessings of all buddhas, and the blessings of all bodhisattvas, Vajrapāṇi proclaimed the vajra essence that emanated from vajra wrath. It is invulnerable, indivisible, indestructible, true, durable, stable, completely indestructible, and completely invincible. It routs all beings, expels all beings, interrupts all spells, subdues all spells, counters all activities, and routs all actions. It destroys all grahas, liberates all grahas, summons all bhūtas, and annihilates all bhūtas.  It enacts the activities of all spells, accomplishes what has not been accomplished, and preserves what has been accomplished. It fulfills all desires and protects all beings. It pacifies and enriches. It paralyzes all beings and stupefies all beings. Through the power of the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi proclaimed this exceedingly powerful mantra:

“Purifying all negativity 
And annihilating all suffering,
This, the root of all tantras,
Is well adorned by every kind of splendor.
“All beings with declining faculties,
Those whose longevity is diminished or weakened, 
Those in poverty or beset with desire, 
Those whom the deities have abandoned,
“Those who are at odds with their families,
Oppressed servants and slaves, 
Parties in disagreement with each other, 
Those harmed by loss of wealth,
“Those who are pained by weariness and grief,
Fearful and destitute people,
Those harmed by planets, constellations, curses,
And unbearable grahas,
“And even those who have nightmares 
Born from their weariness and grief—
This will cleanse them completely; 
All should listen to this sacred discourse.
“Those whose minds are virtuous and pure 
And who are dressed in clean clothes
Should listen to this discourse—
The profound domain of the buddhas.
“Then, through the splendor of this discourse,
Even the most unbearable diseases
Of all living beings
Will be quelled.
“Beings’ lifespans and merit will increase, 
And they will be liberated from all negativity.
Gather jewels, mustard seeds, doob grass,
Gems, flawless sandalwood,
“Crystals, diamonds, and flowers,
And use water to fill a vase of proper material, 
Such as gold or silver,
And wrap it in clean cloth. 
“After reciting the vajra conqueror
Twenty-one or one hundred and eight times,
A king should, in this way, 
Always perform ablutions.
This concludes the dhāraṇī “Vajra Conqueror.”
