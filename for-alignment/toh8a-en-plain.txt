The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines
Chapter 1: The Context
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha, with a large monastic gathering comprising some five thousand monks. All of them were arhats who had attained the cessation of contaminants, free of afflicted mental states, fully controlled, their minds thoroughly liberated, their wisdom well liberated, thoroughbreds, mighty elephants, their tasks accomplished, their work completed, their burdens relinquished, their own objectives fulfilled, the fetters binding them to the rebirth process completely severed, their minds thoroughly liberated through perfect instruction, supreme in their perfection of all mental powers, with the exception of just one person—the venerable Ānanda, a trainee who had entered the stream. Also present were some five hundred nuns—Yaśodharā and Mahāprajāpatī and so on— and a great many laymen and laywomen, all of whom had seen the Dharma. 
There, too, were innumerable, inestimable bodhisattva great beings, all of whom had attained the dhāraṇīs and attained the meditative stabilities, acting in accord with emptiness, their perceptual range being one of signlessness, their aspirations free from deliberation. They had attained forbearance for the sameness of all phenomena, possessed inspired eloquence that was unimpeded, had comprehended the inexhaustible teachings according to their exact knowledge, and used miraculous displays through their great extrasensory powers. With their extrasensory powers never failing, and with engaging speech, without indolence but with perseverance, without regard for their bodies or their lives, their conduct unpretentious, without fawning, and without thoughts of ulterior fame, profit, or respect, free from self-interest they taught the Dharma. They had realized and integrated the sublime acceptance of the profound dharmas, had acquired the great fearlessnesses, were without discouragement, and they had gone completely beyond all the works of Māra. Having interrupted the continuity of karmic obscurations, they had overcome karma, the afflicted mental states, and hostile forces, and in the face of all challenges had remained undefeated. They were difficult for all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to understand, and through their realization were skilled in analyzing and teaching the Dharma. They had energetically applied themselves to their aspirations over countless eons. Smiling and speaking first in welcome, their faces without frowns of anger, with their sweet, gentle words they were skilled in addressing others in melodic verse. As their inspired eloquence flowed uninterrupted, they possessed the fearlessness that overwhelmed endless assemblies. They were skilled in emancipation by means of the transcendental knowledge from having taught for endless tens of millions of eons. They had comprehended that all phenomena are like an illusion, a mirage, a reflection of the moon in water, a dream, an echo, an optical aberration, empty space, a castle in the sky, a reflection, and a magical display. Without discouragement, they were skilled in comprehending the mental attitudes, subtle knowledge, conduct, and interests of all beings. Their attitude toward all beings was free of any animosity, and their tolerance was immense. They were skilled in the transcendental knowledge that brings the sameness of all phenomena to be understood, and because they were possessed of profound reality their depth was hard to estimate. They had fully attained power over their own minds, and they had entirely attained power over all phenomena. They were liberated from all karma, afflicted mental states, and obscurations of view. They were skilled in teaching in dependence on the audience, and had engaged in all the inexhaustible modes of dependent origination, were free from all views, latent impulses, and obsessions, and had abandoned all fetters. They were skilled in bringing peace from all actions and afflicted mental states, skilled in the transcendental knowledge that brings realization of the truth, constantly and uninterruptedly considering all phenomena to resemble an echo, fearless in their measureless teachings of the ways of the Dharma, and skilled in bringing forth comprehension of the true nature itself. Their progress was governed by their aspirational vow to establish infinite buddhafields. Constantly and uninterruptedly they actualized the meditative stability of recollecting the buddhas who reside in countless world systems; they were skilled in going everywhere buddhas arise and skilled in requesting the innumerable buddhas to teach. They were skilled in bringing about peace from the afflicted mental states that are generated through the diverse false views of beings, and skilled in bringing forth realization of the transcendental knowledge that revels in the miraculous production of a hundred thousand meditative stabilities. Every one of them had qualities of which a full description would be incomplete even if infinite eons were spent on it.
Among them were the following: the bodhisattva great being Bhadrapāla, the bodhisattva great being Ratnākara, the bodhisattva great being Ratnagarbha, the bodhisattva great being Ratnadatta, the bodhisattva great being Susārthavāha, the bodhisattva great being Naradatta, the bodhisattva great being Guhagupta, the bodhisattva great being Varuṇadeva, the bodhisattva great being Indradatta, the bodhisattva great being Bhadrabala, the bodhisattva great being Uttaramati, the bodhisattva great being Viśeṣamati, the bodhisattva great being Vardhamānamati, the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin, the bodhisattva great being Anāvaraṇamati, the bodhisattva great being Susaṃprasthita, the bodhisattva great being Suvikrāntavikrāmin, the bodhisattva great being Anantavīrya, the bodhisattva great being Nityodyukta, the bodhisattva great being Nityaprayukta, the bodhisattva great being Anikṣiptadhura, the bodhisattva great being Sūryagarbha, the bodhisattva great being Candragarbha, the bodhisattva great being Anupamamati, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the bodhisattva great being Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, the bodhisattva great being Māra­bala­pramardin, the bodhisattva great being Vajramati, the bodhisattva great being Ratnamudrāhasta, the bodhisattva great being Nityotkṣiptahasta, the bodhisattva great being Mahā­karuṇā­cintin, the bodhisattva great being Mahāvyūha, the bodhisattva great being Vyūharāja, the bodhisattva great being Merukūṭa, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, and many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion others as well. 
At that time, the Blessed One himself arranged his seat, the lion throne, and sat upright with his legs crossed, directing his mindfulness. Seated there, he was absorbed in the meditative stability called king of meditative stabilities, in which all meditative stabilities are gathered, comprehended, pursued, and subsumed.
The Blessed One, mindful and with full awareness, then arose from that meditative stability and observed this buddhafield with divine clairvoyance. Seeing in this manner, he sent out light from his entire body. Sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of the two thousand-spoked wheels that were imprinted on the soles of his feet. Sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of the ten toes of his two feet. Sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two ankles, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two shins, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two knees, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two thighs, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two hips, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from his navel, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of the two sides of his ribs, and sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from the śrīvatsa at his heart, which is one of the major marks of a great person. Sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light also issued from each of his ten fingers, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two arms, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two shoulders, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from his neck, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his four incisors, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his forty teeth, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two eyes, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two ears, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from each of his two nostrils, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from the hair ringlet between his eyebrows, sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from his uṣṇīṣa, and sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light issued from his mouth. 
All of those sets of sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light permeated all the world systems in the great billionfold world system with a great brightness. The world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. All the beings who beheld the light and who were touched by that light became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
Then again, the Blessed One caused light rays to be diffused from all his pores, and that light again permeated this great billionfold world system with a great brightness. The world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. All the beings who beheld that light and who were touched by that light became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
Then again, with the natural light of the tathāgatas the Blessed One caused this great billionfold world system to be permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. The world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were permeated with a great brightness. All the beings who beheld that light and who were touched by that light became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
Then the Blessed One extended his tongue from his mouth. Covering this entire great billionfold world system with his tongue, he smiled, and from his tongue issued forth many hundred thousand ten million billion variegated rays of light. On all those rays of light, in their entirety, appeared manifold lotus flowers, fashioned of diverse gemstones, shining like gold, with a thousand petals, diverse, beautiful to behold, captivating, brilliant, scented, soft, and blissful to the touch like kācalindika. On these lotuses, furthermore, were seated many embodied tathāgatas, and the Dharma teaching they taught was this very Dharma teaching concerning the six perfections. They departed for the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and on arriving there the Dharma teaching they taught was this very Dharma teaching concerning the six perfections. They departed for the world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and on arriving there the Dharma teaching they taught was this very Dharma teaching concerning the six perfections. They departed for the world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and on arriving there the Dharma teaching they taught was this very Dharma teaching concerning the six perfections.

They departed for the world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and on arriving there the Dharma teaching they taught was this very Dharma teaching concerning the six perfections. And they departed for the world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and on arriving there the Dharma teaching they taught was this very Dharma teaching concerning the six perfections. All the beings who heard those teachings became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
Then, while seated on the lion throne, the Blessed One became absorbed in the meditative stability of the buddhas called the lion’s play and manifested his miraculous abilities. By manifesting those miraculous abilities, he caused this great billionfold world system to shake in six ways. That is to say, it shook, shuddered, and juddered; it rocked, reeled, and tottered; it quivered, careened, and convulsed; it trembled, throbbed, and quaked; it rumbled, roared, and thundered; and it faltered, lurched, and staggered. As its eastern sides reared up its western sides plunged down; as its western sides reared up its eastern sides plunged down; as its southern sides reared up its northern sides plunged down; as its northern sides reared up its southern sides plunged down; as its edges reared up its centers plunged down; and as its centers reared up its edges plunged down. Then, slowly and gradually, it settled down, producing benefit and happiness for all beings.
Then, at that time—at that moment, minute, and second—in this great billionfold world system, the hells, the animal realms, the world of Yama, the states that lack freedom, the lower realms, the terrible forms of life, and the degenerations, as many as there are, were all interrupted. All of the beings there were then reborn equal in fortune to human beings; they were reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, or the gods of the Trayastriṃśa, Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, or Paranirmitavaśavartin realms. Then those gods and those human beings joyfully, with serene confidence, and with ease recollected their former lives. Having recollected those lives, they then joyfully, with serene confidence, and with ease departed for where there were blessed ones, and on arriving there paid homage to the blessed ones.

Having recollected those lives, they then joyfully, with serene confidence, and with ease departed for the respective buddhafields where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided, and on arriving there paid homage at their feet. Placing their hands together, they bowed toward those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas.

Then, at that time—at that moment, minute, and second—in the world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, the hells, the animal realms, the world of Yama, the states that lack freedom, the lower realms, the terrible forms of life, and the degenerations, as many as there are, were all interrupted.

Then, at that time, in this great billionfold world system, the beings who were blind, as many as there were, saw sights with their eyes. The deaf heard sounds with their ears. The insane came to their senses. Those who were agitated attained a state of mind without agitation. Those without clothing obtained clothing. The poor obtained wealth. The hungry obtained food. The thirsty obtained drink. Those struck with illness were healed. Those with physical disabilities and with imperfect sense faculties were restored to full perfection of the body and sense faculties, and flourished. The weary were refreshed. Those who had not forsaken nonvirtuous deeds of body, speech, and mind, or nonvirtuous livelihoods, gave up their nonvirtuous deeds of body, speech, and mind, and nonvirtuous livelihoods. All beings too became even-minded toward all other beings, considering one another as just like their father, mother, brother, sister, partner, close relative, or friend. All beings too acquired the path of the ten virtuous actions, and they maintained the practice of chastity and purity, without the stench of immorality and without the notion of nonvirtue. At that time all beings possessed happiness such that it resembled, by comparison, the happiness experienced by monks absorbed in the third meditative concentration. They possessed all such happiness. At that time all beings possessed wisdom such that they knew, “Excellent is generosity! Excellent is discipline! Excellent is restraint! Excellent is truth! Excellent is carefulness! Excellent is loving kindness! Excellent is compassion! Excellent is nonviolence with respect to all living creatures!” And at that time the blessed buddhas in other buddhafields cried out cries of delight: “Ah! It is wonderful that these beings are possessed of wisdom such that they know, ‘Excellent is generosity! Excellent is discipline! Excellent is peace! Excellent is restraint! Excellent is truth! Excellent is carefulness! Excellent is loving kindness! Excellent is compassion! Excellent is the practice of chastity! Excellent is nonviolence with respect to all living creatures!’ ”
At that time the Blessed One, seated on this very lion throne, resembled, as an analogy, the unobscured sun in the clear expanse of space, or the disk of the full moon. He outshone the great billionfold world system with its Sumerus and encircling mountain ranges, with its god realms, with its Indra realms, with its Vaśavartin realms, with its classes of gods and asuras, with its Brahmās, and with its Śuddhāvāsas. He was adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. And while the Blessed One remained seated, outshining this great billionfold world system, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining, he similarly outshone the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. Similarly, he outshone the world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. And similarly, he outshone the world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, being adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining.
To illustrate, just as Sumeru, king of mountains, stands outshining all other dark mountains, adorned, sparkling, gleaming, and shining; just as, to illustrate, the disk of the moon stands outshining all the stars, adorned, sparkling, gleaming, and shining; and just as, to illustrate, the disk of the sun stands outshining all other lights, adorned, sparkling, gleaming, and shining, so too the Blessed One stood outshining the worlds of the ten directions with their gods, Indras, Brahmās, and Śuddhāvāsa realms, adorned with light, a lustrous complexion, splendor, and glory, sparkling, gleaming, and shining.
Then again, the Blessed One showed, in this great billionfold world system, his original body, just as it is. All the gods, as many as there are, of the Śuddhāvāsas, the Ābhāsvara and Brahmakāyika, and the Paranirmitavaśavartin, Nirmāṇarati, Tuṣita, Yāma, Trayastriṃśa, and Cāturmahārājika realms saw the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha seated on the lion throne. They were pleased. They were delighted. They were contented and overjoyed, giving rise to such delight and contentment that they took many divine flowers, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, and divine perfumes; divine blue lotuses, day lotuses, red lotuses, white lotuses, water lilies, and saugandhaka lilies; divine kesara flowers and tamāla leaves; divine robes, divine ornaments, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and set out for the place where the Blessed One was seated. Going there, they sprinkled, scattered, and showered down upon the Blessed One those flowers, garlands, incenses, unguents, powders, and perfumes; blue lotuses, day lotuses, red lotuses, white lotuses, water lilies, and saugandhaka lilies; kesara flowers and tamāla leaves; robes, ornaments, divine parasols, victory banners, and flags of the gods. Those human beings who were disciplined and suitable recipients of the teachings, as many as there were in this great billionfold world system, also brought manifold flowers, ones that grow in water and grow on the plains, and they set out for the place where the Blessed One was seated. Going there, they offered these to the Blessed One.
Through the sustaining power of the Blessed One, all those flowers, garlands, incenses, unguents, powders, and so on, and the robes, ornaments, parasols, victory banners, and flags immediately formed a towering mansion of flowers and so on, as large as the great billionfold world system, in the sky above the head of the Blessed One. From that towering mansion, many tassels made of divine flowers and silk were suspended, draped, and floated in the air. This whole great billionfold world system was exquisitely adorned by these tassels made of flowers and silk, and it was exquisitely adorned, too, by the golden light of the Blessed One, sparkling, gleaming, and shining. And just like this great billionfold world system, so too the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were pervaded and illuminated by that light of the Blessed One. The world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were also pervaded and illuminated by that light of the Blessed One.

Now then, beyond all the world systems in the eastern direction, more numerous than the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is the world system called Ratnavatī. There the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha called Ratnākara resides and maintains himself, teaching this very perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Now then, in that world system there was a bodhisattva great being named Samantaraśmi who, on beholding that great light, the great trembling of the earth, and the body of the Tathāgata, looked upon him insatiably, and set out for the place where the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara was residing. Going there, he inquired of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, “Blessed Lord, what are the causes and what are the conditions for such a great light to manifest in the world, for the earth to tremble in this manner, and for the body of a tathāgata, such as this, to be present?” 
The bodhisattva great being Samantaraśmi having thus inquired, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, replied to him, “Child of a good family, in the western direction, beyond world systems numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is a world system called Patient Endurance. There a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha named Śākyamuni resides and maintains himself at present. He is teaching the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Such is his power.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Samantaraśmi said to the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, “Blessed Lord, I too will go to that world system of Patient Endurance to behold the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, to pay homage and respect to him, and also to see all those bodhisattva great beings, most of whom are crown princes who have acquired the dhāraṇīs and exact knowledges, and have mastered all the meditative stabilities and absorptions.”
The Blessed One, the Tathāgata Ratnākara, then replied, “Go then to that world system of Patient Endurance, child of a good family, if you think it is timely.” 
Then the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, gave the bodhisattva great being Samantaraśmi a thousand lotus flowers, made of diverse jewels, golden in color, each with a thousand petals, and instructed him, “Child of a good family, strew these over the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, and inquire of the Blessed One in my words, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ Child of a good family, you should conduct yourself with care in that buddhafield. If you ask why, it is because bodhisattva great beings who are born in that world system are hard to satisfy. So, beware of harm there.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Samantaraśmi received from the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, those golden thousand-petaled lotuses. Accompanied by many hundred thousand ten million billion bodhisattvas in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women, he vanished from that buddhafield. After serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping all the blessed lord buddhas residing and maintaining themselves in the eastern direction, as many as there were, with flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, unguents, powders, robes, ornaments, parasols, victory banners, and flags, through the bodhisattvas’ great miraculous ability and the bodhisattvas’ great power he set out for the place where the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni resided. 
Arriving there, he bowed his head toward the feet of the Blessed One and took a place to one side. Having taken a place to one side, the bodhisattva great being Samantaraśmi then addressed the Blessed One as follows: “The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, has inquired of the Blessed One, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ And the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara, has sent these golden-colored, thousand-petaled lotuses as an offering to you, Blessed Lord.” 
The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered all those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure. All the beings who heard that teaching of the Dharma also became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. And those bodhisattva great beings in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women also served, respected, honored, and worshiped the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, through the roots of their respective virtuous actions. 
Now then, beyond all the world systems in the southern direction, more numerous than the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is the world system called Sarvaśokāpagata. There the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha called Aśokaśrī resides and maintains himself, teaching this very perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Now then, in that world system there was a bodhisattva great being named Vigataśoka who, on beholding that great light, the great trembling of the earth, and the body of the Tathāgata, looked upon him insatiably, and set out for the place where the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Aśokaśrī, was residing. Going there, he inquired of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Aśokaśrī, “Blessed Lord, what are the causes and what are the conditions for such a great light to manifest in the world, for the earth to tremble in this manner, and for the body of a tathāgata, such as this, to be present?” 
The bodhisattva great being Vigataśoka having thus inquired, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Aśokaśrī, replied to him, “Child of a good family, in the northern direction, beyond world systems numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is a world system called Patient Endurance. There a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha named Śākyamuni resides and maintains himself at present. He is teaching the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Such is his power.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Vigataśoka said to the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Aśokaśrī, “Blessed Lord, I too will go to that world system of Patient Endurance to behold the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, to pay homage and respect to him, and also to see all those bodhisattva great beings, most of whom are crown princes who have acquired the dhāraṇīs and exact knowledges, and have mastered all the meditative stabilities and absorptions.”
The Blessed One, the Tathāgata Aśokaśrī, then replied, “Go then to that world system of Patient Endurance, child of a good family, if you think it is timely.” 
Then the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Aśokaśrī, gave the bodhisattva great being Vigataśoka a thousand lotus flowers, made of diverse jewels, golden in color, each with a thousand petals, and instructed him, “Child of a good family, strew these over the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, and inquire of the Blessed One in my words, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ Child of a good family, you should conduct yourself with care in that buddhafield.

Then the bodhisattva great being Vigataśoka received from the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Aśokaśrī, those golden thousand-petaled lotuses. Accompanied by many hundred thousand ten million billion bodhisattvas in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women, he vanished from that buddhafield. After serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping all the blessed lord buddhas residing and maintaining themselves in the southern direction, as many as there were, with flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, unguents, powders, robes, ornaments, parasols, victory banners, and flags, through the bodhisattvas’ great miraculous ability and the bodhisattvas’ great power he set out for the place where the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni resided.

The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into the world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered all those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure.

Now then, beyond all the world systems in the western direction, more numerous than the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is the world system called Upaśāntā. There the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha called Ratnārcis resides and maintains himself, teaching this very perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Now then, in that world system there was a bodhisattva great being named Cāritramati who, on beholding that great light, the great trembling of the earth, and the body of the Tathāgata, looked upon him insatiably, and set out for the place where the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnārcis, was residing. Going there, he inquired of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnārcis, “Blessed Lord, what are the causes and what are the conditions for such a great light to manifest in the world, for the earth to tremble in this manner, and for the body of a tathāgata, such as this, to be present?”

Arriving there, he bowed his head toward the feet of the Blessed One and took a place to one side. Having taken a place to one side, the bodhisattva great being Cāritramati then addressed the Blessed One as follows: “The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnārcis, has inquired of the Blessed One, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ And the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Ratnārcis, has sent these golden-colored, thousand-petaled lotuses as an offering to you, Blessed Lord.” 
The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into the world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered all those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure. All the beings who heard that teaching of the Dharma also became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. And those bodhisattva great beings in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women also served, respected, honored, and worshiped the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, through the roots of their respective virtuous actions.
Now then, beyond all the world systems in the northern direction, more numerous than the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is the world system called Jayā. There the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha called Jayendra resides and maintains himself, teaching this very perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Now then, in that world system there was a bodhisattva great being named Jayadatta who, on beholding that great light, the great trembling of the earth, and the body of the Tathāgata, looked upon him insatiably, and set out for the place where the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Jayendra, was residing. Going there, he inquired of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Jayendra, “Blessed Lord, what are the causes and what are the conditions for such a great light to manifest in the world, for the earth to tremble in this manner, and for the body of a tathāgata, such as this, to be present?” 
The bodhisattva great being Jayadatta having thus inquired, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Jayendra, replied to him, “Child of a good family, in the southern direction, beyond world systems numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is a world system called Patient Endurance. There a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha named Śākyamuni resides and maintains himself at present. He is teaching the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Such is his power.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Jayadatta said to the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Jayendra, “Blessed Lord, I too will go to that world system of Patient Endurance to behold the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, to pay homage and respect to him, and also to see all those bodhisattva great beings, most of whom are crown princes who have acquired the dhāraṇīs and exact knowledges, and have mastered all the meditative stabilities and absorptions.”
The Blessed One, the Tathāgata Jayendra, then replied, “Go then to that world system of Patient Endurance, child of a good family, if you think it is timely.”
Then the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Jayendra, gave the bodhisattva great being Jayadatta a thousand lotus flowers, made of diverse jewels, golden in color, each with a thousand petals, and instructed him, “Child of a good family, strew these over the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, and inquire of the Blessed One in my words, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ Child of a good family, you should conduct yourself with care in that buddhafield. If you ask why, it is because bodhisattva great beings who are born in that world system are hard to satisfy. So, beware of harm there.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Jayadatta received from the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Jayendra, those golden thousand-petaled lotuses. Accompanied by many hundred thousand ten million billion bodhisattvas in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women, he vanished from that buddhafield. After serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping all the blessed lord buddhas residing and maintaining themselves in the northern direction, as many as there were, with flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, unguents, powders, robes, ornaments, parasols, victory banners, and flags, through the bodhisattvas’ great miraculous ability and the bodhisattvas’ great power he arrived at the place where the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni resided.

The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into the world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered all those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure. All the beings who heard that teaching of the Dharma also became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. And those bodhisattva great beings in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women also served, respected, honored, and worshiped the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, through the roots of their respective virtuous actions.
Now then, beyond all the world systems in the intermediate northeastern direction, more numerous than the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is the world system called Samādhyalaṅkṛta. There the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha called Samādhihastyuttaraśrī resides and maintains himself, teaching this very perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Now then, in that world system there was a bodhisattva great being named Vijayavikrāmin who, on beholding that great light, the great trembling of the earth, and the body of the Tathāgata, looked upon him insatiably, and set out for the place where the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Samādhihastyuttaraśrī, was residing. Going there, he inquired of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Samādhihastyuttaraśrī, “Blessed Lord, what are the causes and what are the conditions for such a great light to manifest in the world, for the earth to tremble in this manner, and for the body of a tathāgata, such as this, to be present?”
The bodhisattva great being Vijayavikrāmin having thus inquired, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Samādhihastyuttaraśrī, replied to him, “Child of a good family, in the intermediate southwestern direction, beyond world systems numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is a world system called Patient Endurance. There a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha named Śākyamuni resides and maintains himself at present. He is teaching the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Such is his power.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Vijayavikrāmin said to the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Samādhihastyuttaraśrī, “Blessed Lord, I too will go to that world system of Patient Endurance to behold the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, to pay homage and respect to him, and also to see all those bodhisattva great beings, most of whom are crown princes who have acquired the dhāraṇīs and exact knowledges, and have mastered all the meditative stabilities and absorptions.”

The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into all the world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure. All the beings who heard that teaching of the Dharma also became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. And those bodhisattva great beings in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women also served, respected, honored, and worshiped the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, through the roots of their respective virtuous actions.
Now then, beyond all the world systems in the direction of the zenith, more numerous than the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is the world system called Nandā. There the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha called Nandaśrī resides and maintains himself, teaching this very perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Now then, in that world system there was a bodhisattva great being named Nandadatta who, on beholding that great light, the great trembling of the earth, and the body of the Tathāgata, looked upon him insatiably, and set out for the place where the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī, was residing. Going there, he inquired of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī, “Blessed Lord, what are the causes and what are the conditions for such a great light to manifest in the world, for the earth to tremble in this manner, and for the body of a tathāgata, such as this, to be present?” 
The bodhisattva great being Nandadatta having thus inquired, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī replied to him, “Child of a good family, in the direction of the nadir, beyond world systems numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, there is a world system called Patient Endurance. There a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha named Śākyamuni resides and maintains himself at present. He is teaching the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Such is his power.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Nandadatta said to the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī, “Blessed Lord, I too will go to that world system of Patient Endurance to behold the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, to pay homage and respect to him, and also to see all those bodhisattva great beings, most of whom are crown princes who have acquired the dhāraṇīs and exact knowledges, and have mastered all the meditative stabilities and absorptions.”
The Blessed One, the Tathāgata Nandaśrī, then replied, “Go then to that world system of Patient Endurance, child of a good family, if you think it is timely.” 
Then the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Nandaśrī, gave the bodhisattva great being Nandadatta a thousand lotus flowers, made of diverse jewels, golden in color, each with a thousand petals, and instructed him, “Child of a good family, strew these over the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, and inquire of the Blessed One in my words, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ Child of a good family, you should conduct yourself with care in that buddhafield. If you ask why, it is because bodhisattva great beings who are born in that world system are hard to satisfy. So, beware of harm there.”
Then the bodhisattva great being Nandadatta received from the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī, those golden thousand-petaled lotuses. Accompanied by many hundred thousand ten million billion bodhisattvas in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women, he vanished from that buddhafield. After serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping all the blessed lord buddhas residing and maintaining themselves in the direction of the zenith, as many as there were, with flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, unguents, powders, robes, ornaments, parasols, victory banners, and flags, through the bodhisattvas’ great miraculous ability and the bodhisattvas’ great power he arrived at the place where the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni resided. 
Arriving there, he bowed his head toward the feet of the Blessed One and took a place to one side. Having taken a place to one side, the bodhisattva great being Nandadatta then addressed the Blessed One as follows: “The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī, has inquired of the Blessed One, ‘I trust you are free from sickness, free from all harms, in good spirits, have your physical strength, and are comfortable and well?’ And the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Nandaśrī, has sent these golden-colored, thousand-petaled lotuses as an offering to you, Blessed Lord.” 
The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into all the world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure. All the beings who heard that teaching of the Dharma also became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. And those bodhisattva great beings in the form of householders, those gone forth , young men, and young women also served, respected, honored, and worshiped the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, through the roots of their respective virtuous actions.
Thereupon, at that moment, minute, and second, the great billionfold world system was completely transformed into the nature of gemstones, replete with scattered flowers, and completely bedecked with tassels and bundles of silk. Various kinds of incense wafted from various containers, and it was completely adorned with wish-fulfilling trees with the tips of their branches bent down with ornaments and various fruits, and with flower trees, fruit trees, fragrance trees, garland trees, powder trees, and incense trees, just like, to illustrate, the world system of Padmavatī, the buddhafield of the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Samantakusuma, where Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta resides alongside Susthitamati Devaputra and other bodhisattva great beings of mighty splendor.

“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who want to train in the tathāgatas’ way of carrying themselves, and who want to train in the tathāgatas’ pure conduct and manner of acting, and in the enlightened activities of the tathāgatas’ body, the enlightened activities of their speech, and the enlightened activities of their mind, which are thoroughly purified and preceded by transcendental knowledge, should train in the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be that I, having looked down as an elephant looks, teach the doctrine to beings without hindrance? How will it come to be that I stretch with the stretch of a lion? How will it come to be that I tread with a tread that is not without purpose? How will it come to be that I walk on the earth without my feet touching it, by the measure of four finger-widths? How will it come to be that I place the soles of my feet on thousand-petaled lotuses and proceed without harming the living creatures that are present beneath my feet? How will it come to be that when I walk, I leave an imprint on the great earth with the soles of my feet with their thousand-spoked wheels? How will it come to be that I make a complete circumambulation of the entire earth within a dimension just the size of a wheel? How will it come to be that even while I am going out for a walk all over the earth I still will not be sullied by the dust of the earth? How will it come to be that I am not physically and mentally tired even while I go to, and walk through, buddhafields that are one yojana; or two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or one hundred yojanas; or one thousand yojanas; or a hundred thousand yojanas; or ten million yojanas, a hundred ten million yojanas, a thousand ten million yojanas, or a hundred thousand ten million yojanas; or ten million billion yojanas, a hundred ten million billion yojanas, a thousand ten million billion yojanas, or a hundred thousand ten million billion yojanas; or an aprameya of yojanas, an asaṃkhya of yojanas, an acintya of yojanas, an atulya of yojanas, an ananta of yojanas, an aparyanta of yojanas, an abhāṣya of yojanas, an anabhilāpya of yojanas, or an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of yojanas?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they also contemplate like this: ‘How will I diffuse one hundred thousand of ten million billion rays of light from the soles of my feet with their thousand-spoked wheels, and, having assuaged all the sufferings of the states lacking freedom and terrible forms of life, secure all beings in happiness?’ While thinking thus, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be that I, surrounded and attended by the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, and many hundred thousand of ten million billion gods of the Trayastriṃśa, Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Paranirmitavaśavartin; Brahmakāyika, Brahmapurohita, Brahma­pārṣadya, and Mahābrahmā; Ābha, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, and Ābhāsvara; Śubha, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, and Śubhakṛtsna; Vṛha, Parīttavṛha, Apramāṇavṛha, and Vṛhatphala; and Avṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha realms, approach the foot of the tree at the seat of enlightenment?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be, when I am seated at the foot of the tree at the seat of enlightenment, that the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, and many hundred thousand of ten million billion gods of the Trayastriṃśa, Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Paranirmitavaśavartin; Brahmakāyika, Brahmapurohita, Brahma­pārṣadya, and Mahābrahmā; Ābha, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, and Ābhāsvara; Śubha, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, and Śubhakṛtsna; Vṛha, Parīttavṛha, Apramāṇavṛha, and Vṛhatphala; and Avṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha realms spread out a cloth mat for me?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be that, while seated at the seat of enlightenment, I touch the great earth with my hand excellently adorned with its major marks and absolutely defeat the dark forces of Māra and his minions?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be that this region of the earth on which I will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and where I move, stand, sit, and recline, will become all diamond?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be that on that very day that I go forth I will defeat the dark forces of Māra and his minions and fully awaken, on that very day, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and, having fully awakened on that very day, how will it come to be that I will turn the wheel of the Dharma? How will it come to be that, having turned it, immeasurable and countless beings will be dust-free, which is to say, having become free from stains, their eye of the Dharma will be purified with respect to phenomena? How will it come to be that immeasurable and countless beings stop further grasping, and have minds free from contaminants, and how will it come to be that immeasurable and countless beings will not turn back from unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should set their minds on enlightenment as follows: ‘How will it come to be, when I have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, that the community of śrāvakas will be immeasurable and countless; that those who attain arhatship in a single sitting through a single teaching of the Dharma are immeasurable and countless; that the bodhisattva great beings do not turn back from unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; that the community of bodhisattvas will be immeasurable and countless; that the measure of my lifespan will be infinite; and that the boundless light will be endowed with excellence?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should set their minds on enlightenment as follows: ‘When I have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, how will there come to be not even the sound of the words attachment, aversion, and delusion in that buddhafield?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should set their minds on enlightenment as follows: ‘When I have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, how will all beings in my buddhafield have such wisdom that they know “generosity is virtuous, discipline is virtuous, restraint is virtuous, chastity is virtuous, nonviolence with respect to all living creatures is virtuous”?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should set their minds on enlightenment as follows: ‘After I have passed into final nirvāṇa, how will it come to be that there are not even the words disappearance of the good Dharma?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should contemplate like this: ‘How will it come to be that just from hearing my name multitudes of beings in world systems numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā become settled in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?’ And when they think such thoughts, they should train in the perfection of wisdom.
“Śāradvatīputra, at the time bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom accomplish these good qualities, then the Four Great Kings are overjoyed, saying, ‘We too will offer them the alms bowls which the Great Kings of the past offered to the tathāgatas of the past.’ The gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm are also overjoyed, saying, ‘We will serve and honor them.’ The gods of the Yāma realm are also overjoyed, the gods of the Tuṣita realm are also overjoyed, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm are also overjoyed, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm are also overjoyed. 
“The gods of the Brahmakāyika realm are also overjoyed, saying, ‘The ranks of the asuras will decline and the ranks of gods will flourish. We will request them, having attained complete buddhahood, to turn the wheel of the Dharma.’ The gods of the Ābhāsvara realm are also overjoyed, the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm are also overjoyed, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm are also overjoyed. The gods of the Avṛha realm are also overjoyed, the gods of the Atapa realm are also overjoyed, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm are also overjoyed, the gods of the Sudarśana realm are also overjoyed, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm are also overjoyed. 
“Śāradvatīputra, at that time when bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom flourish through the six perfections, the sons and daughters of good families in the Bodhisattva Vehicle are also overjoyed, and say, ‘We will become the mother, father, brother, sister, wife, son, daughter, confidant, advisor, relative, companion, and friend of that great being.’ 
“Also the Four Great Kings and the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm; the gods of the Ābha realm, the gods of the Parīttābha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm; the gods of the Śubha realm, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm; the gods of the Vṛha realm, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm; and the gods of the Avṛha realm, the gods of the Atapa realm, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, the gods of the Sudarśana realm, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha gods are overjoyed and say, ‘That bodhisattva great being has given up his entourage of queens.’
“Still, in order to establish beings in enlightenment these bodhisattvas practice celibacy. They do not engage in any sexual acts. They aspire that they might maintain celibacy from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment onward, and that they will not be noncelibate. 
“If you ask why, it is because the pursuit of sensual pleasures may even interrupt rebirth in the Brahmā worlds, so what need to say it may interrupt unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment! Therefore, having gone forth the bodhisattva great beings will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment just as celibate persons. They will not do so as noncelibate persons.” 
The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Śāradvatīputra then asked him, “Blessed Lord, is it definite that bodhisattva great beings will have a father, a mother, a wife, sons, and daughters? 
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “there are some bodhisattva great beings who definitely need to have a father and mother, but who do not need to have sons, daughters, or wives. There are some who definitely need to have a father and mother, and also wives, sons, and daughters.”
“Śāradvatīputra, some bodhisattva great beings take a vow of celibacy from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment onward, and who live as unmarried persons until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. There are some bodhisattva great beings who have engaged in the pleasures of the five senses in order to bring beings to maturity through skillful means. After going forth from their circle of wives they then fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. Śāradvatīputra, some bodhisattva great beings practice the deep perfection of wisdom and, separated from the afflicted mental states of the desire realm, in order to brings beings to maturity, make a show of thoroughly enjoying the five sorts of sense objects, but they do not thoroughly enjoy them with all their heart.
“Śāradvatīputra, if, as an analogy, an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist extremely well trained in magical spells and magical techniques were to conjure the five pleasures of the senses, and were then to make a show of dallying with, delighting in, and enjoying those five pleasures of the senses, do you think, Śāradvatīputra, that that illusionist or apprentice of an illusionist would have actually enjoyed the five pleasures of the senses?” 
“No, Blessed Lord.” 
“In the same way, Śāradvatīputra,” continued the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings who have trained extremely well in the illusion of the Great Vehicle acquire an enjoyment of the reality of phenomena as an illusion. Although they are free from all afflicted mental states, in order to bring beings who are to be trained to maturation they make a show of the enjoyment of the pleasures of the senses by the power of their great compassion, but they neither associate with those pleasures nor are they sullied by them.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings speak of the defects of sense pleasures using many descriptive expressions: ‘Sense objects are all ablaze, sense objects are debased, sense objects are murderous, sense objects are inimical, sense objects are aggressive, sense objects are like a brush fire, sense objects are like the deadly kimpāka fruit, sense objects are like holding the blade of a sword, sense objects are like a heap of embers, sense objects are like poisonous leaves, sense objects are like the iron hook used by an elephant trainer, and sense objects are like a cesspit.’ 
“So it is, Śāradvatīputra, that although bodhisattva great beings are thoroughly cognizant of sense objects, in order that unskilled beings might be brought to maturation, to make them disillusioned with the five sense objects and to separate them from the five sense objects, they demonstrate the five sense objects to them, but without being intoxicated by them, nor being careless, nor engaging in negative actions that have sense objects as their cause and have sense objects as their basis.” 
The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Śāradvatīputra then asked him, “Blessed Lord, how then should bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatīputra, in this regard, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe a bodhisattva. Nor do they observe the term bodhisattva. Nor do they observe the conduct of a bodhisattva. Nor do they observe the perfection of wisdom. Nor do they observe the term perfection of wisdom. Nor do they observe ‘practicing,’ and neither do they observe ‘not practicing,’ nor do they observe ‘practicing when they practice and not practicing when they do not practice,’ nor even do they observe ‘neither practicing nor not practicing.’ They also do not observe physical forms. Nor do they observe feelings. Nor do they observe perceptions. Nor do they observe formative predispositions. Nor do they observe consciousness. 
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because even bodhisattvas are empty of the inherent existence of bodhisattvas. Even the term bodhisattva is empty of the term bodhisattva. If you ask why, it is because such is their inherent nature. It is not owing to emptiness that physical forms are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than physical forms. Physical forms are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed physical forms. It is not owing to emptiness that feelings are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than feelings. Feelings are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed feelings. It is not owing to emptiness that perceptions are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than perceptions. Perceptions are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed perceptions. It is not owing to emptiness that formative predispositions are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than formative predispositions. Formative predispositions are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed formative predispositions. It is not owing to emptiness that consciousness is empty, nor is emptiness anything other than consciousness. Consciousness is indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed consciousness. If you ask why, it is because even this ‘enlightenment’ is merely a name. Even this ‘bodhisattva’ is merely a name. Even this ‘emptiness’ is merely a name. Even this ‘physical forms’ is merely a name, even this ‘feelings’ is merely a name, even this ‘perceptions’ is merely a name, even this ‘formative predispositions’ is merely a name, even this ‘consciousness’ is merely a name. 
“And that is because physical forms are like an illusion, feelings are like an illusion, perceptions are like an illusion, formative predispositions are like an illusion, and consciousness is like an illusion. Illusions are merely names. They are not located in any direction, nor are they located in any place. The illusions that are seen do not really exist. They have not arisen. They are false. They are without inherent existence. They are without essential nature, nonarising, unceasing, not remaining, without increase, without decrease, without defilement, and without purification. Bodhisattva great beings who practice accordingly do not observe any phenomenon that arises. 
“They do not observe anything that ceases. They do not observe anything that remains. They do not observe anything that increases. They do not observe anything that decreases. They do not observe anything that is defiled. They do not observe anything that is purified. They do not observe physical forms. They do not observe feelings. They do not observe perceptions. They do not observe formative predispositions. They do not observe consciousness. They do not even observe anything that is ‘enlightenment’ or ‘a bodhisattva.’ If you ask why, it is because the name of each separate phenomenon is an illusion, and from those designations that are unreal names that have adventitiously arisen, the falsely imagined are employed as conventions.
“Fixation on them comes about on the basis of convention. Therefore, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe—which is to say, do not apprehend—any phenomena. Since they do not observe and do not apprehend anything, they do not give rise to conceit. They do not become attached to them.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they investigate like this: ‘This bodhisattva is a mere name. This enlightenment is a mere name. This buddha is a mere name. This perfection of wisdom is a mere name. This practicing the perfection of wisdom is a mere name. This physical forms is a mere name. This feelings is a mere name. This perceptions is a mere name. This formative predispositions is a mere name. This consciousness is a mere name.’
“For example, Śāradvatīputra, one conventionally speaks of a self again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitively investigated. One conventionally speaks of a being again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitively investigated. One conventionally speaks of a life form again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a life again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of an individual again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a person again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of one born of Manu again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a child of Manu again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of an agent again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of an instigator of an agent again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of an experiencer again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of an instigator of an experiencer again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a motivator again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of an inciter again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a knower again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a viewer again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of a toucher again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitely investigated. One conventionally speaks of one who is conscious again and again even though it cannot be apprehended when definitively investigated, because of the emptiness of what cannot be apprehended. Rather, these are simply mere names and symbols employed as conventions. 
“Similarly, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they too do not observe a bodhisattva. They do not observe enlightenment. They do not observe buddhas. They do not observe the perfection of wisdom. They do not observe ‘they are practicing the perfection of wisdom.’ They do not observe physical forms. They do not observe feelings. They do not observe perceptions. They do not observe formative predispositions. They do not observe consciousness. Nor do they even observe those names that are employed as conventions. 
“Based on the emptiness of not apprehending, bodhisattva great beings who thus practice the perfection of wisdom outshine all wisdoms other than that, up to and including the wisdom of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, except for the wisdom of the tathāgatas. If you ask why, it is because they do not even apprehend anything on account of which they might be attached. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice accordingly are practicing the perfection of wisdom. 
“To illustrate, Śāradvatīputra, if this Jambudvīpa were filled entirely with monks of the caliber of Śāradvatīputra and Maudgalyāyana—like a thicket of naḍa reeds, or a thicket of rushes, or a grove of sugarcane, or a thicket of bamboo, or a paddy field of rice, or a field of sesame—their wisdom would not approach even a hundredth part of the wisdom of a bodhisattva great being who practices the perfection of wisdom. It would not approach a thousandth part, would not approach a hundred thousandth part, would not approach a hundred ten millionth part, would not approach a thousand ten millionth part, would not approach a hundred thousand ten millionth part, would not approach a hundred ten million billionth part, would not approach a thousand ten million billionth part, and would not approach a hundred thousand ten million billionth part—it would not approach any number, would not approach any fraction, would not approach any calculation, would not approach any example, and would not stand up even to any comparison. If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because that wisdom of bodhisattva great beings is established so that all beings will pass into final nirvāṇa. The wisdom of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is not so.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, a bodhisattva great being who practices the perfection of wisdom continues, even with as much wisdom as they have cultivated in a single day, to outshine the wisdom of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Śāradvatīputra, not to mention just this Jambudvīpa filled entirely with monks of the caliber of Śāradvatīputra and Maudgalyāyana, if this whole great billionfold world system were also filled entirely with monks similar to you, their wisdom would not approach even a hundredth part of the wisdom that has been cultivated for a single day by a bodhisattva great being practicing the perfection of wisdom. It would not approach a thousandth part, would not approach a hundred thousandth part, would not approach a hundred ten millionth part, would not approach a thousand ten millionth part, would not approach a hundred thousand ten millionth part, would not approach a hundred ten million billionth part, would not approach a thousand ten million billionth part, and would not approach a hundred thousand ten million billionth part—it would not approach any number, would not approach any fraction, would not approach any calculation, would not approach any example, and would not stand up even to any comparison.
“Śāradvatīputra, leaving aside this great billionfold world system, even if, Śāradvatīputra, the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were filled entirely with monks of the caliber of Śāradvatīputra and Maudgalyāyana, their wisdom would not approach even a hundredth part of the wisdom that a bodhisattva great being who practices the perfection of wisdom has cultivated in a single day. It would not approach a thousandth part, would not approach a hundred thousandth part, would not approach a hundred ten millionth part, would not approach a thousand ten millionth part, would not approach a hundred thousand ten millionth part, would not approach a hundred ten million billionth part, would not approach a thousand ten million billionth part, and would not approach a hundred thousand ten million billionth part—it would not approach any number, would not approach any fraction, would not approach any calculation, would not approach any example, and would not stand up even to any comparison.

Śāradvatīputra asked, “Blessed Lord, the wisdom of the śrāvakas who enter the stream, who are once-returners, who are non-returners, and who are arhats, and the wisdom of pratyekabuddhas, the wisdom of bodhisattvas, and the wisdom of tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas—all those wisdoms cannot be differentiated. They are indivisible, empty, void, nonarising in their inherent nature, and empty of essential nature. Blessed Lord, if no difference or distinction is to be found in that which is indivisible, void, nonarising, and empty of essential nature, how then, Blessed Lord, does the wisdom cultivated in a single session by bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom outshine the wisdom of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “do you think that the wisdom of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is established to be similar in purpose to that for which the wisdom cultivated in a single day by bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom is established, when they think, ‘Having practiced the knowledge of the aspects of the path and worked for the sake of all beings, having fully awakened to all phenomena in all aspects, we must cause all beings to pass into final nirvāṇa’?” 
“No, Blessed Lord!” he replied.
The Blessed One then asked, “Śāradvatīputra, do you think that there are any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas who think, ‘Once we have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, we must enable all beings to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa with no residue of the aggregates’?” 
“No, Blessed Lord, I do not think so!” he replied.
The Blessed One then said, “Therefore, for this reason also, Śāradvatīputra, you should understand that when that which is the wisdom of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas has been compared to this wisdom that is the wisdom of a bodhisattva great being, it does not approach even a hundredth part, does not approach a thousandth part, does not approach a hundred thousandth part, does not approach a hundred ten millionth part, does not approach a thousand ten millionth part, does not approach a hundred thousand ten millionth part, does not approach a hundred ten million billionth part, does not approach a thousand ten million billionth part, and does not approach a hundred thousand ten million billionth part—it does not approach any number, does not approach any fraction, does not approach any calculation, does not approach any example, and does not stand up even to any comparison.
“Śāradvatīputra, do you think that there are any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas who think, ‘Once we have practiced the six perfections, brought beings to maturity, refined the buddhafields, perfected the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and perfected the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, we must enable immeasurable, countless beings to attain final nirvāṇa’?”
“No, Blessed Lord, I do not think so!” he replied.
“Śāradvatīputra,” said the Blessed One, “a bodhisattva great being thinks, ‘Once I have practiced the six perfections, brought beings to maturity, refined the buddhafields, perfected the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and perfected the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, I must enable immeasurable, countless beings to attain final nirvāṇa.’ 
“To illustrate, Śāradvatīputra, just as a firefly-type creature does not think, ‘May my light illuminate all Jambudvīpa! May my light extensively fill Jambudvīpa!’ in the same way, Śāradvatīputra, there are no śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas at all who think, ‘Once I have practiced the six perfections, brought beings to maturity, refined the buddhafields, perfected the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and perfected the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, I will enable immeasurable, countless beings to attain final nirvāṇa.’
“Again to illustrate, Śāradvatīputra, just as the disk of the sun, when it rises, suffuses the entirety of Jambudvīpa with its light and illuminates the entirety of Jambudvīpa with its light, in the same way, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who have practiced the perfection of wisdom have also brought beings to maturity, refined the buddhafields, perfected the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and perfected the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, enable immeasurable, countless beings to attain final nirvāṇa.”
The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Śāradvatīputra then asked him, “Blessed Lord, how do bodhisattva great beings transcend the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, attain the level of an irreversible bodhisattva, and refine the path of a bodhisattva?” 
The venerable Śāradvatīputra having asked this, the Blessed One said to him, “Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings, starting from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment, practice the six perfections, they dwell in the practice of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. Through skillful means they will transcend the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and then attain the level of an irreversible bodhisattva.”
Śāradvatīputra asked, “Blessed Lord, standing at which level are bodhisattva great beings worthy of receiving the donations of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings who practice the six perfections from the time when they first set their minds on enlightenment until they are seated at the seat of enlightenment are worthy recipients of the donations of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. 
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because there are bodhisattva great beings that all virtuous attributes emerge in the world. So it is that the path of the ten virtuous actions emerges in the world, that the five trainings emerge in the world, that the eight-branched confession and restoration emerges in the world, that the four meditative concentrations emerge in the world, that the four immeasurable attitudes emerge in the world, that the four formless absorptions emerge in the world, that the five extrasensory powers emerge in the world, that the six mindfulnesses emerge in the world, that the perfection of generosity emerges in the world, that the perfection of ethical discipline emerges in the world, that the perfection of tolerance emerges in the world, that the perfection of perseverance emerges in the world, that the perfection of meditative concentration emerges in the world, and that the perfection of wisdom emerges in the world, that the emptiness of internal phenomena emerges in the world, that the emptiness of external phenomena emerges in the world, that the emptiness of external and internal phenomena emerges in the world, that the emptiness of emptiness emerges in the world, that the emptiness of great extent emerges in the world, that the emptiness of ultimate reality emerges in the world, that the emptiness of conditioned phenomena emerges in the world, that the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena emerges in the world, that the emptiness of the unlimited emerges in the world, that the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end emerges in the world, that the emptiness of nonexclusion emerges in the world, that the emptiness of inherent nature emerges in the world, that the emptiness of all phenomena emerges in the world, that the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics emerges in the world, that the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended emerges in the world, that the emptiness of nonentities emerges in the world, that the emptiness of essential nature emerges in the world, and that the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities emerges in the world; that the four applications of mindfulness emerge in the world, that the four correct exertions emerge in the world, that the four supports for miraculous ability emerge in the world, that the five faculties emerge in the world, that the five powers emerge in the world, that the seven branches of enlightenment emerge in the world, and that the noble eightfold path emerges in the world; and that the four truths of the noble ones emerge in the world, that the eight liberations emerge in the world, that the nine serial steps of meditative absorption emerge in the world, that the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation emerge in the world, that all the meditative stabilities emerge in the world, that all the dhāraṇī gateways emerge in the world, that the ten powers of the tathāgatas emerge in the world, that the four fearlessnesses emerge in the world, that the four kinds of exact knowledge emerge in the world, that great loving kindness emerges in the world, that great compassion emerges in the world, and that the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas emerge in the world.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are many phenomena—starting from those virtuous attributes—that emerge in the world. It is because those virtuous attributes appear in the world that there are great and lofty royal families, that there are great and lofty priestly families, and that there are great and lofty householder families; that there are the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, that there are the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, that there are the gods of the Yāma realm, that there are the gods of the Tuṣita realm, that there are the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and that there are the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; that there are the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, that there are the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, that there are the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and that there are the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm; that there are the gods of the Ābha realm, that there are the gods of the Parīttābha realm, that there are the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, and that there are the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm; that there are the gods of the Śubha realm, that there are the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, that there are the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and that there are the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm; that there are the Vṛha gods, that there are the Parīttavṛha gods, and that there are the Apramāṇavṛha gods; that there are the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm, that there are the gods of the Avṛha realm, that there are the gods of the Atapa realm, that there are the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, that there are the gods of the Sudarśana realm, and that there are the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm; that there are the gods of the sphere of infinite space, that there are the gods of the sphere of infinite consciousness, that there are the gods of the sphere of nothing-at-all, and that there are the gods of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception; that there are those who have entered the stream in the world, that there are once-returners in the world, that there are non-returners in the world, that there are arhats in the world, that there are pratyekabuddhas in the world, and that there are bodhisattvas in the world—which is to say, that there are tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas in the world.”
Then he asked, “Blessed One, in that case do bodhisattva great beings purify those donations?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings purify those donations in many ways. If you ask why, it is because, for bodhisattva great beings, all donations are indeed utterly pure. Furthermore, it is in that very manner, Śāradvatīputra, that bodhisattva great beings offer their gifts. If you ask what sorts of gifts they offer, they offer the gift of many virtuous attributes. Thus they offer the gift of the path of the ten virtuous actions, the five trainings, the eight-branched confession and restoration, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the five extrasensory powers, and the six mindfulnesses; the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; and the four truths of the noble ones, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, all the meditative stabilities, all the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.”
“Blessed Lord, how do bodhisattva great beings ‘engage’ with it when they engage with the perfection of wisdom?”
The Blessed One said, “Bodhisattva great beings are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of physical forms. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of feelings. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of perceptions. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of formative predispositions. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the eyes. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the ears. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the nose. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the tongue. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the body. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the mental faculty. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of sights. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of sounds. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of odors. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of tastes. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of tangibles. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of mental phenomena.
“They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of the eyes. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of sights. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of visual consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of the ears. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of sounds. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of auditory consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of the nose. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of odors. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of olfactory consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of the tongue. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of tastes. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of gustatory consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of the body. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of tangibles. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of tactile consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of the mental faculty. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of phenomena. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sensory element of mental consciousness. 
“They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of suffering. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the origin. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of cessation. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the path. 
“They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of ignorance. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of formative predispositions. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of consciousness. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of name and form. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the sense fields. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of sensory contact. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of sensation. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of craving. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of grasping. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of the rebirth process. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of birth. And they are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of aging and death. 
“They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of all phenomena. They are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of all those conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, as many as there are, that exist designated as names.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are said to engage with it when they engage with the emptiness of inherent nature. So, accordingly, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are said to engage with it when they engage with the seven emptinesses. Yet even though they are practicing the perfection of wisdom with these seven emptinesses, they are not said to be engaged with it or to be not engaged with it. 
“If you ask why, it is because they do not observe physical forms ‘engaged’ with it or ‘not engaged’ with the perfection of wisdom; do not observe feelings ‘engaged’ with it or ‘not engaged’ with it; do not observe perceptions ‘engaged’ with it or ‘not engaged’ with it; do not observe formative predispositions ‘engaged’ with it or ‘not engaged’ with it; and do not observe consciousness ‘engaged’ with it or ‘not engaged’ with it. 
“They do not observe physical forms qualified by arising or qualified by ceasing; do not observe feelings qualified by arising or qualified by ceasing; do not observe perceptions qualified by arising or qualified by ceasing; do not observe formative predispositions qualified by arising or qualified by ceasing; and do not observe consciousness qualified by arising or qualified by ceasing. 
“They do not observe physical forms qualified by defilement or qualified by purification; do not observe feelings qualified by defilement or qualified by purification; do not observe perceptions qualified by defilement or qualified by purification; do not observe formative predispositions qualified by defilement or qualified by purification; and do not observe consciousness qualified by defilement or qualified by purification.
“They do not observe physical forms ‘flowing along together’ with feelings. They do not observe feelings ‘flowing along together’ with physical forms. They do not observe feelings ‘flowing along together’ with perceptions. They do not observe perceptions ‘flowing along together’ with feelings. They do not observe perceptions ‘flowing along together’ with formative predispositions. They do not observe formative predispositions ‘flowing along together’ with perceptions. They do not observe formative predispositions ‘flowing along together’ with consciousness. They do not observe consciousness ‘flowing along together’ with formative predispositions. 
“If you ask why, it is because there is no phenomenon that is ‘flowing along together’ with any other phenomenon. Owing to the emptiness of inherent nature, there is no going together with any other phenomenon, no going separately, no connection, and no disconnection.
“Śāradvatīputra, the emptiness of physical forms is not physical forms, because the emptiness of physical forms does not obstruct. The emptiness of feelings is not feelings, because the emptiness of feelings does not feel. The emptiness of perceptions is not perceptions, because the emptiness of perceptions does not perceive. The emptiness of formative predispositions is not formative predispositions, because the emptiness of formative predispositions does not condition anything. And the emptiness of consciousness is not consciousness, because the emptiness of consciousness does not make anything conscious.
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because physical forms are not other than emptiness, and emptiness is not other than physical forms. Physical forms are emptiness. Emptiness is physical forms. Feelings are not other than emptiness, and emptiness is not other than feelings. Feelings are emptiness. Emptiness is feelings. Perceptions are not other than emptiness, and emptiness is not other than perceptions. Perceptions are emptiness. Emptiness is perceptions. Formative predispositions are not other than emptiness, and emptiness is not other than formative predispositions. Formative predispositions are emptiness. Emptiness is formative predispositions. Consciousness is not other than emptiness, and emptiness is not other than consciousness. Consciousness is emptiness. Emptiness is consciousness.
“Śāradvatīputra, that emptiness neither arises nor ceases. It is neither defiled nor purified. It neither decreases nor increases. It is neither past, nor is it future, nor is it present. In that which neither arises nor ceases, is neither defiled nor purified, neither decreases nor increases, and is neither past, nor future, nor present, there are no physical forms, there are no feelings, there are no perceptions, there are no formative predispositions, and there is no consciousness. In that, there are no eyes, there are no ears, there is no nose, there is no tongue, there is no body, and there is no mental faculty. In that, there are no sights, there are no sounds, there are no odors, there are no tastes, there are no tangibles, and there are no mental phenomena.
“In that, there is no sensory element of the eyes, there is no sensory element of sights, and there is no sensory element of visual consciousness. In that, there is no sensory element of the ears, there is no sensory element of sounds, and there is no sensory element of auditory consciousness. In that, there is no sensory element of the nose, there is no sensory element of odors, and there is no sensory element of olfactory consciousness. In that, there is no sensory element of the tongue, there is no sensory element of tastes, and there is no sensory element of gustatory consciousness. In that, there is no sensory element of the body, there is no sensory element of tangibles, and there is no sensory element of tactile consciousness. In that, there is no sensory element of the mental faculty, there is no sensory element of mental phenomena, and there is no sensory element of mental consciousness. 
“In that, there is no earth element, there is no water element, there is no fire element, there is no wind element, there is no consciousness element, and there is no space element. 
“In that, there is no ignorance, and there is no cessation of ignorance. In that, there are no formative predispositions, and there is no cessation of formative predispositions. In that, there is no consciousness, and there is no cessation of consciousness. In that, there are no name and form, and there is no cessation of name and form. In that, there are no six sense fields, and there is no cessation of the six sense fields. In that, there is no sensory contact, and there is no cessation of sensory contact. In that, there is no sensation, and there is no cessation of sensation. In that, there is no craving, and there is no cessation of craving. In that, there is no grasping, and there is no cessation of grasping. In that, there is no rebirth process, and there no cessation of the rebirth process. In that, there is no birth, and there is no cessation of birth. In that, there are no aging and death, and there is no cessation of aging and death.
“In that, there is no suffering, and there is no understanding of suffering. In that, there is no origin, and there is no abandonment of the origin. In that, there is no cessation, and there is no actualization of cessation. And in that, there is no path, and there is no cultivation of the path. 
“In that, there is nothing to be attained. There is nothing to be clearly realized. In that, there is no one who has entered the stream, and there is no fruit of having entered the stream. In that, there is no once-returner, and there is no fruit of once-returner. In that, there is no non-returner, and there is no fruit of non-returner. In that, there is no arhat, and there is no fruit of arhatship. In that, there is no individual enlightenment, and there is no pratyekabuddha. In that, there is no bodhisattva, and there is no knowledge of the aspects of the path. In that, there is no buddha, and there is no enlightenment.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice accordingly are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom, but, even though they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they do not observe that they either ‘engage’ or ‘do not engage’ with physical forms.

They do not practice the perfection of wisdom for the sake of the different sorts of miraculous ability.

“If you ask why, it is because when they practice the perfection of wisdom they do not even see the perfection of wisdom itself, let alone a bodhisattva, so, however could they apprehend the extrasensory powers that know all in all their aspects? Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not think, ‘I, standing on the supports for miraculous ability, will serve, will respect, will honor, and will worship all the blessed lord buddhas, as many as there are, who are present in the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā.’

“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they come face-to-face with the dhāraṇī gateways, the gateways of meditative stability, and the gateways of the kinds of exact knowledge, including the exact knowledge of inspired eloquence, without great difficulty. In every sphere of birth, furthermore, they will please the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas. They will never be separated from those blessed lord buddhas until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom do not think, ‘Is there any sort of phenomenon conjoined with or separated from, or that might come together or might not come together with, phenomena?’ If you ask why, it is because they do not observe any sort of phenomenon that is conjoined or separated, or that might come together or might not come together. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom do not think, ‘Might I fully awaken to the realm of phenomena or might I not?’ If you ask why, it is because the realm of phenomena has not fully awakened, will not fully awaken, and is not fully awakening to the realm of phenomena. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe any phenomenon at all that is different from the realm of phenomena. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not make a difference between the realm of phenomena and any phenomenon. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom do not think, ‘Will I comprehend the realm of phenomena, or will I not comprehend it?’ This is because they do not observe any phenomenon that is the sort of thing that would come to be comprehended by means of a phenomenon, because they do not associate the realm of phenomena with ‘empty’ and do not associate it with ‘not empty.’
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice in that manner are said to engage with the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not associate physical forms with emptiness, nor do they associate emptiness with physical forms. They do not associate feelings with emptiness, nor do they associate emptiness with feelings. They do not associate perceptions with emptiness, nor do they associate emptiness with perceptions.

They do not associate the sensory element of mental consciousness with emptiness, nor do they associate emptiness with the sensory element of mental consciousness.
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because this—the yogic practice of emptiness—is the ultimate yogic practice. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice emptiness do not fall to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas. They also refine the buddhafields, and they also bring beings to maturity. They will fully awaken swiftly to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Śāradvatīputra, whatever the yogic practices, among them the yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom is said to be the best, is described as the supreme, is described as the highest, is described as perfect, is described as the foremost, and is described as the most sublime. 
“If you ask why, it is because this—the yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom, a yogic practice of emptiness, of signlessness, and of wishlessness—is a yogic practice that is unsurpassed. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who engage in that manner are said to be prophesied because they are approaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Śāradvatīputra, although bodhisattva great beings who engage in that manner act on behalf of immeasurable, countless beings, they do not think, ‘I am engaging’ or ‘I am not engaging’ with the perfection of wisdom. They do not think, ‘I will be prophesied by the blessed lord buddhas. I am about to be prophesied. I will refine the buddhafields. I will bring beings to maturity. I will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. I will turn the wheel of the Dharma.’
“And why? It is because they do not distinguish details in the realm of phenomena. Apart from the realm of phenomena, they do not observe any sort of phenomenon at all that is a practice of the perfection of wisdom, or about which the blessed lord buddhas will make a prophecy, or that will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. If you ask why, it is because when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, the perception of beings does not arise.
“The perception of a self does not arise. The perception of a life form does not arise. The perception of a living being does not arise. The perception of a life does not arise. The perception of an individual does not arise. The perception of a person does not arise. The perception of one born of Manu does not arise. The perception of a child of Manu does not arise. The perception of an actor does not arise. The perception of an experiencer does not arise. The perception of a knower does not arise. The perception of a viewer does not arise.
“If you ask why, it is because beings absolutely do not arise, nor do they cease. A being has no arising or cessation, so how could that which neither arises nor ceases practice the perfection of wisdom? Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner practice the perfection of wisdom as beings who do not arise. They practice the perfection of wisdom as beings who are emptiness. 
“They practice the perfection of wisdom as beings who cannot be apprehended. They practice the perfection of wisdom as beings who are void. They practice the perfection of wisdom as beings who are without inherent existence. They practice the perfection of wisdom as beings who are without an essential nature. 
“Śāradvatīputra, this is the bodhisattva great beings’ supreme yogic practice. It is a yogic practice of emptiness. Śāradvatīputra, this is the yogic practice of bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom. It endures when all other yogic practices have been surpassed. 
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who are practicing this yogic practice achieve the ten powers of the tathāgatas. They achieve the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings maintaining this yogic practice do not entertain thoughts of miserliness, and do not entertain thoughts of degenerate morality, thoughts of agitation, thoughts of indolence, thoughts of distraction, or thoughts of stupidity.”
The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Śāradvatīputra then inquired of him, “Blessed Lord, where did they die and transmigrate from, those bodhisattva great beings who are reborn here, who practice in accordance with this yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom? And where will they be reborn when they have died here?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “you should know that these bodhisattva great beings who practice in accordance with this yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom have died and transmigrated from other buddhafields, so as to be reborn here, or else they have died a god of the Tuṣita class, or died a human and transmigrated so as to be reborn here.
“In this regard, Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings who have died in, and transmigrated from, other buddhafields, so as to be reborn here, swiftly achieve the yogic practice—that is, this yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom. Even after passing away from this life, these profound dharmas become manifest to them. Then again they will be absorbed in the yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom. They will be reborn in whichever buddhafield the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas reside and maintain themselves, and will again please those tathāgatas, worthy ones, perfectly complete buddhas. 
“In this regard, Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings who have died a god of the Tuṣita class and transmigrated, so as to be reborn here, are also those with keen faculties. They are bound by a single birth. They will be undiminished in their understanding of the six perfections, and there are none of the dhāraṇī gateways and the gateways of meditative stability that will not be brought together in them.
“Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings who have died in, and transmigrated from, the human realm, so as to be reborn with the same good fortune of humankind, will have dull faculties, unless they are irreversible bodhisattva great beings. They will not become swiftly absorbed in the yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom. Nor indeed will the dhāraṇī gateways or the gateways of meditative stability swiftly become manifest to them.
“Śāradvatīputra, you asked, ‘Where will those bodhisattva great beings who are absorbed in this yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom be reborn when they have died here and transmigrated?’ Śāradvatīputra, having died in, and transmigrated from, this buddhafield, those bodhisattva great beings will go from here to those buddhafields where the blessed lord buddhas reside and maintain themselves. They will never be separated from the blessed lord buddhas until they have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings are engaging in the perfection of wisdom in order to bring beings to maturity, even though they may have actualized, through the power of skillful means, the fruit of having entered the stream, they still do not feel pride on account of that.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are bodhisattva great beings without skillful means who become absorbed in the first meditative concentration, become absorbed in the second meditative concentration, become absorbed in the third meditative concentration, become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration, and practice the six perfections. Since they have attained the meditative concentrations, they will be reborn among the long-living gods. Even if they do obtain a rebirth among human beings and please the blessed lord buddhas, they are still those with dull faculties, not keen faculties.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, there are bodhisattva great beings who also are absorbed in the meditative concentrations and also practice the perfections, but since they are without skillful means, after abandoning the meditative concentrations they too will be reborn in this realm of desire. Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings too will have dull faculties, not keen faculties. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who become absorbed in the first meditative concentration, become absorbed in the second meditative concentration, become absorbed in the third meditative concentration, and become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration; become absorbed in loving kindness, become absorbed in compassion, become absorbed in empathetic joy, and become absorbed in equanimity; become absorbed in the sphere of infinite space, become absorbed in the sphere of infinite consciousness, become absorbed in the sphere of nothing-at-all, and become absorbed in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception; become absorbed in the four applications of mindfulness, become absorbed in the four correct exertions, become absorbed in the four supports for miraculous ability, become absorbed in the five faculties, become absorbed in the five powers, become absorbed in the seven branches of enlightenment, and become absorbed in the noble eightfold path; and become absorbed in great compassion. Endowed as they are with great compassion, owing to their skillful means, their rebirth will not be influenced by the meditative concentrations, their rebirth will not be influenced by the pure abidings, and their rebirth will not be influenced by the formless absorptions, but they will be reborn wherever the blessed lord buddhas reside and maintain themselves. Since they do not part from the yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom, they will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment right here in this Auspicious Eon.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who become absorbed in the first meditative concentration, become absorbed in the second meditative concentration, become absorbed in the third meditative concentration, and become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration; become absorbed in loving kindness, become absorbed in compassion, become absorbed in empathetic joy, and become absorbed in equanimity; and become absorbed in the sphere of infinite space, become absorbed in the sphere of infinite consciousness, become absorbed in the sphere of nothing-at-all, and become absorbed in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception, who, owing to their skillful means, will not be reborn through the influence of the meditative concentrations, meditative stabilities, or meditative absorptions. Even though they later they might be reborn in this realm of desire, they will be born into great and lofty royal families, they will be born into great and lofty priestly families, or they will be born into great and lofty householder families. This is not out of yearning for the rebirth process but in order to bring beings to maturity.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who become absorbed in the first meditative concentration, become absorbed in the second meditative concentration, become absorbed in the third meditative concentration, and become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration; become absorbed in loving kindness, become absorbed in compassion, become absorbed in empathetic joy, and become absorbed in equanimity; and become absorbed in the sphere of infinite space, become absorbed in the sphere of infinite consciousness, become absorbed in the sphere of nothing-at-all, and become absorbed in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception, who, owing to their skillful means, will not be reborn through the influence of the meditative concentrations, meditative stabilities, or meditative absorptions. They will be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm.
“They will be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm. They will be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Tuṣita realm. They will be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm. They will be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm. Dwelling in these realms, they will bring beings to maturity. They will refine the buddhafields, and they will also please the blessed lord buddhas.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom, and who, owing to their skillful means, become absorbed in the first meditative concentration, become absorbed in the second meditative concentration, become absorbed in the third meditative concentration, and become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration; become absorbed in loving kindness, become absorbed in compassion, become absorbed in empathetic joy, and become absorbed in equanimity; and become absorbed in the sphere of infinite space, become absorbed in the sphere of infinite consciousness, become absorbed in the sphere of nothing-at-all, and become absorbed in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception.
“Having died here and transmigrated, they are reborn in the Brahmaloka. They become the best, supreme, and most excellent of beings there, like those holding sway over one thousand powerful Brahmās and Mahābrahmās. Residing there, they move from buddhafield to buddhafield, like the ones where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have fully awakened and remain turning the wheel of the Dharma. They also request those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas to turn the wheel of the Dharma.
“Śāradvatīputra, also there are bodhisattva great beings bound by a single birth who practice the perfection of wisdom, and who, owing to their skillful means, become absorbed in the first meditative concentration, become absorbed in the second meditative concentration, become absorbed in the third meditative concentration, and become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration; become absorbed in loving kindness, become absorbed in compassion, become absorbed in empathetic joy, and become absorbed in equanimity; and become absorbed in the sphere of infinite space, become absorbed in the sphere of infinite consciousness, become absorbed in the sphere of nothing-at-all, and become absorbed in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception.
“They cultivate the four applications of mindfulness. They cultivate the four correct exertions. They cultivate the four supports for miraculous ability. They cultivate the five faculties. They cultivate the five powers. They cultivate the seven branches of enlightenment. They cultivate the noble eightfold path.
“They become absorbed in the meditative stabilities on emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. However, they will not be reborn due to their influence. They please the blessed lord buddhas who have become manifest, and having practiced the chaste conduct, are reborn equal in fortune to the gods of Tuṣita. Remaining there for a lifetime, with undiminished sense faculties, mindfulness, and alertness, surrounded by, and at the head of, many one hundred thousand one hundred million billion gods, they demonstrate a birth here, and, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, turn the wheels of the Dharma in various buddhafields. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who have attained the six extrasensory powers, who do not take birth in the realm of desire, do not take birth in the realm of form, and do not take birth in the realm of formlessness. They serve, respect, honor, and worship the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, proceeding on from buddhafield to buddhafield.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also the bodhisattva great beings who have attained the six extrasensory powers, and who, playing with the six extrasensory powers, pass on from buddhafield to buddhafield—the sorts of buddhafields where, apart from the Great Vehicle, there is not even the sound of the names vehicle of the srāvakas or vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who have attained the six extrasensory powers, and who, playing with the six extrasensory powers, proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield—the sorts of buddhafields where the lifespan of beings is for an aprameya.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who have attained the six extrasensory powers, and who proceed from world system to world system, where the minds of those beings are then illuminated by the sound of Buddha, the sound of Dharma, and the sound of Saṅgha. They too will be reborn wherever the blessed lord buddhas reside and are alive at present.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who have attained the six extrasensory powers, and who proceed from world system to world system—the sorts of world systems where the sound of Buddha does not resonate, where the sound of Dharma does not resonate, and where the sound of Saṅgha does not resonate. They speak of the excellence of the Buddha, they speak of the excellence of the Dharma, and they speak of the excellence of the Saṅgha, so that, on account of the sound of Buddha, the sound of Dharma, and the sound of Saṅgha, those beings also become serenely confident and they take birth, after their death there, wherever those blessed lord buddhas are residing.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, after they first set their minds on enlightenment, have attained the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, and the five extrasensory powers; the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; and the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. They are never reborn in the realm of desire, nor are they reborn in the realm of form or the realm of formlessness, but still they work there for the benefit of beings.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who practice the six perfections, and who, through first setting their minds on enlightenment, enter a bodhisattva’s maturity and attain the level at which progress becomes irreversible. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, through first setting their minds on enlightenment, fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and who, having fully awakened, turn the wheel of the Dharma. Acting for the benefit of countless and immeasurable beings, they attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of final nirvāṇa where no residue of the aggregates is left behind; and, even after passing into final nirvāṇa, their Dharma will remain for an eon, or for more than an eon.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also the bodhisattva great beings who, through first setting their minds on enlightenment, become absorbed in the yogic practice of the perfection of wisdom, and who, accompanied by many hundred thousand one hundred million billion bodhisattvas, also move from buddhafield to buddhafield together with them in order to behold the blessed lord buddhas, to bring beings to maturity, and to refine the buddhafields. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom, and who have attained the four concentrations, have attained the four immeasurables, and have attained the four formless absorptions. They play in many ways with these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions. That is to say, they become absorbed in the first meditative concentration and, having arisen from that first meditative concentration, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the second meditative concentration. Having arisen from that second meditative concentration, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the third meditative concentration. Having arisen from that third meditative concentration, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the fourth meditative concentration. Having arisen from that fourth meditative concentration, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the sphere of infinite space. Having arisen from that sphere of infinite space, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the sphere of infinite consciousness. Having arisen from that infinite consciousness, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the sphere of nothing-at-all. Having arisen from that sphere of nothing-at-all, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. Having arisen from that cessation absorption, they become absorbed in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception. And, having arisen from that sphere of neither perception nor nonperception, they become absorbed in the cessation absorption. 
“Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings thus practicing the perfection of wisdom with skillful means again and again press down on and become absorbed in those meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, meditative stabilities, and absorptions. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who have attained the four applications of mindfulness, who have attained the four correct exertions, who have attained the four supports for miraculous ability, who have attained the five faculties, who have attained the five powers, who have attained the seven branches of enlightenment, and who have attained the noble eightfold path; who have attained the four truths of the noble ones, who have attained the meditative concentrations, who have attained the immeasurable attitudes, who have attained the formless absorptions, who have attained the eight liberations, who have attained the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, who have attained emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, who have attained the extrasensory powers, who have attained the meditative stabilities, and who have attained the dhāraṇīs; and who have attained the ten powers of the tathāgatas, who have attained the four fearlessnesses, who have attained the four kinds of exact knowledge, and who have attained the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. But even though they have attained them, the three gateways to liberation do not cause them to attain the fruit of entering the stream, do not cause them to attain the fruit of once-returner, do not cause them to attain the fruit of non-returner, do not cause them to attain arhatship, and do not cause them to attain individual enlightenment. Practicing the perfection of wisdom and assisted by skillful means they teach the noble eightfold path to beings and cause them to attain the fruit of entering the stream, cause them to attain the fruit of once-returner, cause them to attain the fruit of non-returner, cause them to attain arhatship, and cause them to attain individual enlightenment. Śāradvatīputra, the transcendental knowledge of the fruits that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are to attain is a bodhisattva great being’s forbearance. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner are known to be irreversible.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections, and who refine the paradise of Tuṣita. Śāradvatīputra, they are known as bodhisattva great beings of the Auspicious Eon.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom, who have attained the four meditative concentrations, who have attained the four immeasurable attitudes, who have attained the four formless absorptions, who have attained the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment, who have attained the six extrasensory powers, and who have attained the ten powers of the tathāgatas, who have attained the four fearlessnesses, who have attained the four kinds of exact knowledge, and who have attained the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Even though they practice in order to comprehend the four truths of the noble ones, the four truths are not what they finally realize. Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings are known to be bound by a single birth.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who practice the six perfections and who move from world system to world system. They encourage the beings there toward enlightenment, and they refine the buddhafields. Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment over the course of countless, immeasurable eons.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections and who always persevere for the sake of beings. They never speak harmful words. Nor indeed do they commit physical acts or mental acts that are harmful. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections who always persevere for the sake of beings. They move from buddhafield to buddhafield, interrupting the three pathways on which beings proceed to terrible forms of life.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections who, having become a wheel-turning emperor, are actively engaged in the perfection of generosity, arranging all the resources that bring comfort to beings and supplying them with the decent requisites for life: food to those who want food, drinks to those who want drink, vehicles to those who need vehicles, flowers to those who want flowers, incense to those who want incense, garlands to those who want garlands, unguents to those who want unguents, seats and beds to those who want seats and beds, clothes to those who want clothes, jewels to those who want jewels, pearls to those who want pearls, gold to those who want gold, silver to those who want silver, corals to those who want corals, ornaments to those who want ornaments, sustenance to those who want sustenance, and families to those who want families.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections and who are actively engaged in the perfection of ethical discipline, who will establish beings in the vows pertaining to body, speech, and mind. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections and who are actively engaged in the perfection of tolerance, who will establish beings in nonanger and nonmalice.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections and who are actively engaged in the perfection of perseverance, who will establish beings in manifestly engaging in all virtuous dharmas.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections and who are actively engaged in the perfection of meditative concentration, who will establish beings one-pointedly in stilling, and in detachment from desires.
“Having established beings in, up to the ten virtuous action paths they are reborn among the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, up to among the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm and fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment in various buddhafields. Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings who, having perfectly developed the four meditative concentrations, weaken them down to the first meditative concentration, having dwelled on the experience of the first meditative concentration, take birth among the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm. They again, having perfectly developed the concentrations and having taken birth among the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm, fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment in various buddhafields. Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings who, having died in the Brahmaloka, have taken birth in a Śuddhāvāsa, having jumped over one or two of the Śuddhāvāsa, are reborn in Akaniṣṭha and fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment in various buddhafields.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections and who are actively engaged in the perfection of wisdom. They emanate a body like that of the tathāgatas. They teach the Dharma in order that denizens of the hells, beings born within the animal realm, and beings of the world of Yama might transcend all the lower realms.
“Śāradvatīputra, thus there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections, who emanate a body like that of the buddhas, and who, proceeding to the buddhafields of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, teach the Dharma to beings, please the tathāgatas, listen to their Dharma, and behold the community of bodhisattvas and also the distinguishing attributes of the buddhafields.

“They fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment in various buddhafields.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are bodhisattva great beings who, having dwelled on the experience of the meditative concentrations and the formless absorptions take birth as gods of the Brahmakāyika up to as gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realms. They then take birth in the sphere of infinite space up to the peak of existence and then take birth in various buddhafields. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are those bodhisattva great beings who, having attained the meditative concentrations and the formless absorptions, take birth as gods of the Brahmakāyika realm up to as gods of the Bhavāgra realm. They then take birth in various buddhafields.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the six perfections, having acquired the thirty-two major marks of a great human being, become endowed with clear sense faculties and a purified body. Through their purified bodies they will cause many beings to rejoice and aspire. They become pleasing and agreeable to the hearts of many people. Just that wholesome root of those beings with that aspiration, furthermore, enables them to attain final nirvāṇa in a gradual manner by means of the three vehicles.
“Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they should train in the purity of body, they should train in the purity of speech, and they should train in the purity of mind. 
“Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings who practice the six perfections and have obtained extremely clear sense faculties, owing to these extremely clear sense faculties, neither praise themselves nor do they disparage others.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, from when they first set their mind on enlightenment, maintain the perfection of generosity and the perfection of ethical discipline, and until they attain the level at which progress becomes irreversible, are never destitute, do not go wrong, and never fall to the lower realms.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, from when they first set their minds on enlightenment, until they attain the level at which progress becomes irreversible, will never forsake the path of the ten virtuous actions. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the perfection of generosity and the perfection of ethical discipline, and who, on becoming wheel-turning emperors, establish beings in the path of the ten virtuous actions, and attract beings through their generosity and pleasant voice.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the perfection of generosity and the perfection of ethical discipline, and who, on assuming the empire of a wheel-turning emperor, maintain many hundreds of thousands of empires of wheel-turning emperors. Maintaining them, they please many one hundred thousand one hundred million billion buddhas, and they serve, respect, honor, and worship those blessed lord buddhas with all sorts of resources and various offerings.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who maintain the six perfections, who illuminate the darkness of beings with wrong views through the Dharma of the buddhas, and they themselves will never be without that illumination of the buddhas’ Dharma until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings will fully awaken to a pratyekabuddha’s awakening in the world systems where there are no buddhas and there are no śrāvakas. With skillful means, having brought many one hundred thousand ten million living creatures to maturation, they will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. This, Śāradvatīputra, is the arising of the bodhisattva great beings in the qualities of the buddhas.
“Therefore, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they provide no opportunity for physical, verbal, and mental action that is basically unethical.”
The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Śāradvatīputra then inquired of him, “Blessed Lord, what are the physical actions that are basically unethical, which bodhisattva great beings might have? What are the verbal actions that are basically unethical? And what are the mental actions that are basically unethical?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “when bodhisattva great beings think, ‘This is the body on the basis of which I will undertake a physical action. This is the speech on the basis of which I will undertake a verbal action. This is the mind on the basis of which I will undertake a mental action,’ Śāradvatīputra, that undertaking of a physical, verbal, or mental action of a bodhisattva great being is basically unethical.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom do not apprehend the body, they do not apprehend speech, and they do not apprehend the mind—the sorts of body, speech, or mind that would generate thoughts of miserliness, or that would generate thoughts of degenerate morality, or that would generate thoughts of malice, or that would generate thoughts of indolence, or that would generate thoughts of distraction, or that would generate thoughts of stupidity. 
“Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they will not be known even to cause a physical negativity to arise, cause a verbal negativity to arise, or cause mental negativity to arise. It is impossible. If you ask why, it is because, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they purify the negativity of body, they purify the negativity of speech, and they purify the negativity of mind. These, Śāradvatīputra, are the bodhisattva great beings’ absence of physical action that is basically unethical, absence of verbal action that is basically unethical, and absence of mental action that is basically unethical.”
Śāradvatīputra then asked, “Blessed Lord, how do bodhisattva great beings purify the negativity of body? How do they purify the negativity of speech? How do they purify the negative of mind?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “when bodhisattva great beings do not apprehend the body, do not apprehend speech, and do not apprehend the mind, then, Śāradvatīputra, these bodhisattva great beings purify the negativity of the body, purify the negativity of speech, and purify the negativity of the mind.
“Moreover, I say, Śāradvatīputra, were bodhisattva great beings, commencing from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment, to have adopted and continued to pursue the paths associated with the ten virtuous actions without ever developing the mindset of the śrāvakas or the mindset of the pratyekabuddhas, were they to have constantly and always established an attitude of great compassion at all times for the sake of all beings, that would be the bodhisattva great beings’ purification of the negativity of the body, purification of the negativity of speech, and purification of the negativity of the mind.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom who refine the path to enlightenment, and who practice the perfection of generosity, practice the perfection of ethical discipline, practice the perfection of tolerance, practice the perfection of perseverance, practice the perfection of meditative concentration, and practice the perfection of wisdom.” 
“What, Blessed Lord, is the bodhisattva great beings’ path to enlightenment?” asked Śāradvatīputra.
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom they do not apprehend a body, do not apprehend speech, and do not apprehend a mind; they do not apprehend the perfection of generosity, do not apprehend the perfection of ethical discipline, do not apprehend the perfection of tolerance, do not apprehend the perfection of perseverance, do not apprehend the perfection of meditative concentration, and do not apprehend the perfection of wisdom; and they do not apprehend a vehicle of the śrāvakas, do not apprehend a vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, do not apprehend a vehicle of the bodhisattvas, and do not apprehend a vehicle of the perfectly complete buddhas. This, Śāradvatīputra, is the path to enlightenment that bodhisattva great beings will have because they thus do not apprehend, do not accept, and do not reject any phenomena.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice and earnestly apply the six perfections on such a path as this cannot be overcome by anyone.”
“In what manner, Blessed Lord, do bodhisattva great beings who cannot be overcome practice?” asked Śāradvatīputra.
The Blessed One replied, “When bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not give rise to conceit about physical forms, do not give rise to conceit about feelings, do not give rise to conceit about perceptions, do not give rise to conceit about formative predispositions, and do not give rise to conceit about consciousness. They do not give rise to conceit about the eyes and sights, do not give rise to conceit about the ears and sounds, do not give rise to conceit about the nose and odors, do not give rise to conceit about the tongue and tastes, do not give rise to conceit about the body and tangibles, and do not give rise to conceit about the mental faculty and mental phenomena.

They proceed to the world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and please the tathāgatas, arhats, and perfectly complete buddhas, and serve, respect, honor, and worship them. They proceed to the world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and please the tathāgatas, arhats, and perfectly complete buddhas, and serve, respect, honor, and worship them. They proceed to the world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and please the tathāgatas, arhats, and perfectly complete buddhas, and serve, respect, honor, and worship them. They proceed to the world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and please the tathāgatas, arhats, and perfectly complete buddhas, and serve, respect, honor, and worship them. 
“ ‘These will attain the extrasensory powers, and those will not attain the extrasensory powers. These have attained the forbearance, and those have not attained the forbearance. These have attained the faculties, and those have not attained the faculties. The buddhafields of these bodhisattva great beings will be utterly pure and the buddhafields of those bodhisattva great beings will not be utterly pure. These bodhisattva great beings have the great aspiration and those bodhisattva great beings do not have the great aspiration. These have brought beings to maturity, and those have not brought beings to maturity.
“ ‘These bodhisattva great beings are praised by the blessed lord buddhas, throughout the world systems of the ten directions, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, and those are not praised. These bodhisattva great beings will stand alongside the blessed lord buddhas, and those will not stand alongside them. Having attained enlightenment, the lifespan of these bodhisattva great beings will be infinite, and the lifespan of those will be finite. The luminosity, voice, and community of monks of these bodhisattva great beings will be immeasurable, while of those they will be measurable. These bodhisattva great beings, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, will have a community of bodhisattvas, and those will not. These will engage in austerities, and those will not engage in them. These are in their final rebirth, and those are not in their final rebirth. These will sit upon the seat of enlightenment, and those will not sit there. These bodhisattva great beings will not face Māras, and those will face Māras.’
“Like this, then, Śāradvatīputra, is the bodhisattva great beings’ refined eye of the Dharma.” 
Śāradvatīputra then asked, “Blessed Lord, what is the bodhisattva great beings’ refined eye of the buddhas?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings, after the mind of enlightenment, become absorbed in the vajra-like meditative stability, and then attain all-aspect omniscience. They are endowed with the ten powers of the tathāgatas, endowed with the four fearlessnesses, endowed with the four kinds of exact knowledge, endowed with the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, endowed with great loving kindness, endowed with great compassion, endowed with great empathetic joy, endowed with great equanimity, and endowed with the unobscured liberation of the buddhas.
“This is their eye. Endowed with that eye, there is nothing at all that bodhisattva great beings do not see, do not hear, do not know, or do not comprehend. This, Śāradvatīputra, is the refined eye of the buddhas of the bodhisattva great beings who have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who wish to refine and who want to acquire those five eyes should persevere in the six perfections.
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because there are no virtuous attributes that are not gathered in the six perfections. There are no attributes of the śrāvakas, no attributes of the pratyekabuddhas, no attributes of the bodhisattvas, and no attributes of the buddhas that are not gathered in the six perfections—all are. Śāradvatīputra, when those who speak correctly are required to speak of that in which all virtuous attributes are gathered, they speak of the perfection of wisdom. If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, the perfection of wisdom generates the five eyes. Bodhisattva great beings who train in those five eyes will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom acquire perfection in the extrasensory powers and experience many facets of miraculous ability. They may even cause this mighty earth to shake. They can be one and become many. They can be many and become one. They can also experience themselves as appearing and as disappearing. With their body unobstructed they go right through walls, right through enclosures, and right through mountains, as they would through the sky. They can also move through space, sitting with their legs crossed, like a bird on the wing. They also emerge up onto the earth and sink down into it, as they would do in water. They can walk on water, without sinking, as if on solid ground. They can also emit smoke and flames of fire, like a big bonfire.
“However miraculous, powerful, and mighty the sun and the moon might be, they can stroke them with their hands, extending their power, up to Brahmaloka, with their physical bodies. Yet, they do not give rise to conceit on account of such miraculous abilities. If you ask why, it is because those abilities are essentially empty, essentially void, and essentially nonarising, so they do not apprehend those miraculous abilities on the basis of which they might give rise to conceit. 
“Apart from focusing on omniscience, they do not entertain even just the thought of a miraculous ability or of manifesting a miraculous ability. Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they will manifest knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the facets of miraculous ability are realized. 
“Since they have the refined divine sensory element of the ears, which surpasses that of human beings, they can hear the voices of gods and humans. However, they do not give rise to conceit on account of that divine sensory element of the ears, thinking, ‘I can hear voices,’ because they do not apprehend them as ears and voices because they are essentially empty, essentially void, and essentially nonarising. Apart from focusing on omniscience, they do not entertain even just the thought of a divine sensory element of the ears. Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they accomplish the knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the divine sensory element of the ears is realized.
“They can correctly cognize with their own minds the minds of other beings and the minds of other persons, exactly as they are. They correctly cognize greedy minds as greedy minds, and they correctly cognize minds free from desire as minds free from desire. They correctly cognize minds with hatred as minds with hatred, and they correctly cognize minds free from hatred as minds free from hatred. They correctly cognize minds with delusion as minds with delusion, and they correctly cognize minds free from delusion as minds free from delusion. They correctly cognize minds with craving as minds with craving, and they correctly cognize minds free from craving as minds free from craving. They correctly cognize minds with grasping as minds with grasping, and they correctly cognize minds free from grasping as minds free from grasping. They correctly cognize minds that are composed as minds that are composed, and they correctly cognize minds that are distracted as minds that are distracted. They correctly cognize minds that are circumscribed as minds that are circumscribed, and they correctly cognize minds that are expanded as minds that are expanded. They correctly cognize minds that are broad as minds that are broad.
“They correctly cognize minds that have gotten bigger as minds that have gotten bigger, and they correctly cognize minds that are unlimited as minds that are unlimited. They correctly cognize minds that are in absorption as minds that are in absorption, and they correctly cognize minds that are not in absorption as minds that are not in absorption. They correctly cognize minds that are liberated as minds that are liberated, and they correctly cognize minds that are unliberated as minds that are unliberated. They correctly cognize minds that are contaminated as minds that are contaminated, and they correctly cognize minds that are uncontaminated as minds that are uncontaminated. They correctly cognize minds with a blemish as minds with a blemish, and they correctly cognize minds without a blemish as minds without a blemish. They correctly cognize minds that are surpassed as minds that are surpassed, and they correctly cognize minds that are unsurpassed as minds that are unsurpassed. Yet they do not give rise to conceit on account of this knowledge of other minds. It is thus, because the mind itself is inconceivable, so they do not give rise to the conceit ‘I know.’ Because it is essentially empty, essentially void, and essentially nonarising, they do not apprehend a mind on the basis of which they would give rise to conceit. Apart from focusing on omniscience, they do not entertain either the thought of knowing minds, or even just the thought of manifesting the knowing of minds. Therefore, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they manifest knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the minds and conduct of all beings are realized. 
“They manifest many facets of the knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the recollection of past lives is realized. That is to say, they may recollect one thought, or they may recollect anything from that up to a hundred thoughts.
“They may recollect one day, or they may recollect anything from that up to a hundred days. They may recollect one month, or they may recollect anything from that up to a hundred months. They may recollect one year, or they may recollect anything from that up to a hundred years. They may recollect one eon, or they may recollect anything from that up to a hundred eons. They may recollect even many thousand eons. They may recollect even many hundred thousand eons. They may recollect even many hundred thousand ten million billion eons. 
“ ‘I was in such-and-such a place, named so-and-so, in such-and-such a lineage, with such-and-such a birth status, following such-and-such a diet, with an allotted lifespan of such-and-such a duration, living for such-and-such a length of time. Thus, having died there I was born in such-and-such places, up to, and having died there then I took birth here.’ In this way, they can recollect in many details their own past lives and those of others, along with the conditions, the reasons for them, and the bad they foretell. Yet, they do not give rise to conceit even on account of this knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the recollection of past lives is realized, because that knowledge is not knowledge—it is inconceivable. They do not give rise to the conceit ‘I know.’ It is thus because it is essentially empty, essentially void, and essentially nonarising, so they do not apprehend any knowledge on the basis of which they would give rise to conceit.
“Apart from focusing on omniscience, they do not entertain even just a thought directed toward knowledge that recollects anything. Therefore, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they will manifest knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the recollection of past lives is realized.
“They cognize through their refined divine eye of clairvoyance, which surpasses the vision of humans, those beings who are dying, those who are reborn, those who are beautiful, those who are ugly, those who are excellent, those who are vile, those who dwell in the lower realms, and those who dwell in blissful realms. They cognize, ‘These beings misconduct themselves physically, these misconduct themselves verbally, and these misconduct themselves mentally. They deprecate sublime beings. Due to the causes and conditions of adopting wrong views, when they have died, they will be reborn in inferior realms, falling into the lower abodes, as denizens of the hells! These beings are endowed with noble conduct of the body. They are endowed with noble conduct of speech, and they are endowed with noble conduct of the mind. They do not deprecate sublime beings. Due to the causes and conditions of adopting correct views, when they have died, they will be reborn within the blissful and exalted realms!’ So it is that they correctly cognize the births and deaths of all those included within the six classes of beings in all world systems of all ten directions within the whole infinity of the realm of phenomena and the very reaches of the realm of space. Yet, they do not give rise to conceit even on that account. That is because this eye is not an eye—it is inconceivable.
“They do not give rise to the conceit ‘I see.’ It is thus because it itself is essentially empty, essentially void, and essentially nonarising, so they do not apprehend an eye on the basis of which they would give rise to conceit. Apart from focusing on omniscience, they do not entertain even just a thought of a divine eye of clairvoyance, or of manifesting the divine eye of clairvoyance. Therefore, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they will manifest knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the divine eye of clairvoyance is realized. 
“They manifest knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the cessation of contaminants is realized, and yet do not acquire the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas. Nor do they see anything at all that would become unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“With that extrasensory power, having attained the vajra-like meditative stability, they abandon all the propensities for afflicted mental states that cause linking up. Yet they do not give rise to conceit even on account of that extrasensory power through which the cessation of contaminants is realized, because that knowledge is not knowledge—it is inconceivable. They do not give rise to the conceit ‘I know.’ It is thus because it itself is essentially empty, essentially void, and essentially nonarising, so they do not apprehend any such extrasensory power realizing knowledge of the extinction of contaminants, on the basis of which they would give rise to conceit. Apart from focusing on omniscience, they do not entertain even just a thought of a knowledge of the extinction of contaminants, or manifesting the knowledge of the extinction of contaminants.
“Therefore, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, they will manifest knowledge of the extrasensory power through which the cessation of contaminants is realized.
“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner and perfect the six extrasensory powers flourish through unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, dwell in the perfection of generosity, and also refine the path to all-aspect omniscience, because their minds are unattached, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, dwell in the perfection of ethical discipline, and also refine the path to all-aspect omniscience, because they commit no offences, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited. Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, dwell in the perfection of tolerance, and also refine the path to all-aspect omniscience, because they are undisturbed, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited. Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, dwell in the perfection of perseverance, and also refine the path to all-aspect omniscience, because their physical and mental perseverance is indefatigable, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited.
“Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, dwell in the perfection of meditative concentration, and also refine the path to all-aspect omniscience, because their minds are undisturbed, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited. Śāradvatīputra, there are also bodhisattva great beings who, when they practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, dwell in the perfection of wisdom, and also refine the path to all-aspect omniscience, because they do not apprehend thoughts of stupidity, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited. Therefore, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they dwell in the six perfections and refine the path to all-aspect omniscience because they neither come nor go, and because they are without grasping, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited.
“In that regard, generosity is designated in relation to holding on to things. Ethical discipline is designated in relation to immorality. Tolerance is designated in relation to impatience. Perseverance is designated in relation to indolence. Meditative stability is designated in relation to lack of absorption. Wisdom is designated in relation to stupidity.
“They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I have crossed.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I have not crossed.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am generous.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am not generous.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I have ethical discipline.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I have poor discipline.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘My tolerance is excellent.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am angry.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am persevering.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am indolent.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am absorbed in meditation.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am not absorbed in meditation.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am wise.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am stupid.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am reviled.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I receive homage.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am being served.’ They do not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am not being served.’
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because something that has not arisen does not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am reviled.’ It does not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I receive homage.’ It does not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am being served.’ It does not give rise to conceit, thinking, ‘I am not being served.’ If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because the perfection of wisdom cuts off the arising of all conceit. 
“In this regard, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, whatever good qualities they possess are not found in any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. When they have perfected those good qualities, they also bring beings to maturity, refine the buddhafields, and also attain all-aspect omniscience.
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they set their minds, in regard to all beings, on the fact that they are the same, and having set their minds on the fact that all beings are the same, they will acquire sameness with respect to all phenomena. After they have acquired sameness with respect to all phenomena, they will establish all beings in sameness with respect to all phenomena. In this very life they become a pleasure to the blessed lord buddhas and dear to them; they also become a pleasure to all bodhisattvas, all śrāvakas, and all pratyekabuddhas and dear to them all. Wherever they are reborn, their eyes will never behold unpleasant sights. Their ears will not hear unpleasant sounds. Their noses will not smell unpleasant odors. Their tongues will not savor unpleasant tastes. Their bodies will not touch unpleasant tangibles. Their mental faculties will not experience unpleasant mental phenomena. Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom in that manner are not lacking in what is necessary for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.” 
While this teaching of the perfection of wisdom was being revealed, three hundred monks presented as an offering to the Blessed One their outer robes being properly worn, and set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. Thereupon, the Blessed One smiled on that occasion, knowing the aspirations of those monks. 
Then the venerable Ānanda, rising from his seat, with his upper robe over one shoulder, rested his right knee on the ground and, placing his hands together in the gesture of homage toward the Blessed One, bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, “Blessed Lord, since the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas do not smile without reason or circumstances, what is the reason and what are the circumstances for your smile?” 
The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, when sixty-one eons have passed, during the eon called Starlike these three hundred monks will all appear in the world as tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas named Mahāśrī. Having died here, they will be reborn in the buddhafield of the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Akṣobhya. Sixty thousand gods who frequent the realm of desire will also set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and they will also please the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Maitreya. Right there they will go forth to homelessness and adopt chaste conduct. The tathāgata Maitreya too will prophesy their unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.” 
Then, through the power of the Buddha, the four assemblies who were present on that occasion beheld ten thousand buddhas in the eastern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the southern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the western direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the northern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the intermediate northeastern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the intermediate southeastern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the intermediate southwestern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the intermediate northwestern direction, beheld ten thousand buddhas in the direction of the nadir, and beheld ten thousand buddhas in the direction of the zenith. 
Those attributes that are seen arrayed in the buddhafields of those blessed lord buddhas in those world systems are arrays of good qualities of buddhafields that are not seen in this world system of Patient Endurance. Ten thousand living beings in that assembly then made the following aspirational vow: “We should engage in the work that, when the work has been done, leads to our taking birth in those buddhafields.”
Then the Blessed One, aware of the aspiration of those children of good families, smiled. The venerable Ānanda, rising from his seat, with his upper robe over one shoulder, rested his right knee on the ground and, placing his hands together in the gesture of homage toward the Blessed One, bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, “Blessed Lord, since the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas do not smile without reason and circumstances, what is the reason and what are the circumstances for your smile?”
The Blessed One then asked, “Ānanda, do you see these ten thousand living beings?”
“I see them, Blessed One,” he replied.
“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “when these ten thousand living beings have passed away from here, they will be reborn in those buddhafields and will never be separated from the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas. In the future, they will all emerge in the world as tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas named Vyūharāja.” 
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra, the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, the venerable Subhūti, the venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, the venerable Mahākāśyapa, and a multitude of other monks, all of whom had extrasensory powers, as well as a multitude of bodhisattva great beings, and a multitude of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, all addressed the Blessed One:
“Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the great perfection of bodhisattva great beings. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the vast perfection of bodhisattva great beings. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the sacred perfection of bodhisattva great beings. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the best perfection of bodhisattva great beings.

Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the unparalleled perfection of bodhisattva great beings. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the incomparable perfection of bodhisattva great beings. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of space.
“Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings is the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings is the emptiness of all phenomena. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings is the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings is the perfection of all attributes. Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings is endowed with all attributes. Blessed Lord, this, the perfection of wisdom, is the uncrushable perfection of bodhisattva great beings.
“Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom have bestowed, are bestowing, and will bestow a gift that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have perfected, are perfecting, and will perfect generosity that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have acquired, are acquiring, and will acquire a physical form that is equal to the unequaled.

“Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom have cultivated, are cultivating, and will cultivate tolerance that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have perfected, are perfecting, and will perfect tolerance that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have acquired, are acquiring, and will acquire a physical form that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have attained, are attaining, and will attain this dharma that is equal to the unequaled—unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom have undertaken, are undertaking, and will undertake perseverance that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have perfected, are perfecting, and will perfect perseverance that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have acquired, are acquiring, and will acquire a physical form that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have attained, are attaining, and will attain this dharma that is equal to the unequaled—unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom have developed, are developing, and will develop meditative concentration that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have perfected, are perfecting, and will perfect meditative concentration that is equal to the unequaled. On account of that, they have acquired, are acquiring, and will acquire a physical form that is equal to the unequaled.

On account of that, they have attained, are attaining, and will attain this dharma that is equal to the unequaled—unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“The Blessed Lord, too, through practicing just this perfection of wisdom also acquired physical forms equal to the unequaled; acquired feelings equal to the unequaled; acquired perceptions equal to the unequaled; acquired formative predispositions equal to the unequaled; and acquired consciousness equal to the unequaled. Having fully awakened to an enlightenment that is equal to the unequaled, you turned the wheel of the Dharma equal to the unequaled. 
“Through practicing this perfection of wisdom, the blessed lord buddhas of the past also have acquired physical forms that are equal to the unequaled; have acquired feelings equal to the unequaled; have acquired perceptions equal to the unequaled; have acquired formative predispositions equal to the unequaled; and have acquired consciousness equal to the unequaled. Having manifestly awakened to enlightenment that is equal to the unequaled, they have turned the wheel of the Dharma that is equal to the unequaled. Through practicing this perfection of wisdom, the blessed lord buddhas of the future also will acquire physical forms that are equal to the unequaled; will acquire feelings equal to the unequaled; will acquire perceptions equal to the unequaled; will acquire formative predispositions equal to the unequaled; and will acquire consciousness equal to the unequaled. Having manifestly awakened to enlightenment that is equal to the unequaled, they will turn the wheel of the Dharma that is equal to the unequaled.

Having manifestly awakened to enlightenment that is equal to the unequaled, they are turning the wheel of the Dharma that is equal to the unequaled.
“Blessed Lord, since this is the case, bodhisattva great beings who want to perfect all attributes should make an effort at the perfection of wisdom. Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom are rightly paid homage by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras.” 
All those great śrāvakas, and all those bodhisattva great beings, having spoken thus, the Blessed One said to them, “Children of good family, it is so! It is so! It is just as you have said! Those bodhisattva great beings who practice this perfection of wisdom deserve to be paid homage by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras.
“If you ask why, it is because it is thanks to bodhisattva great beings that the world of humans becomes manifest in the world, that the world of gods becomes manifest in the world, that great and lofty royal families become manifest in the world, that great and lofty priestly families become manifest in the world, that great and lofty royal families become manifest in the world, and that wheel-turning emperors become manifest in the world; that the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Yāma realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Tuṣita realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm become manifest in the world, and that the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm become manifest in the world; that the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm become manifest in the world, and that the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm become manifest in the world; that the gods of the Ābha realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Parīttābha realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm become manifest in the world, and that the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm become manifest in the world; that the gods of the Śubha gods realm in the world, that the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm become manifest in the world, and that the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm become manifest in the world; that the gods of the Vṛha realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm become manifest in the world, and that the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm become manifest in the world; that the gods of the Avṛha realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Atapa realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Sudṛśa realm become manifest in the world, that the gods of the Sudarśana realm become manifest in the world, and that the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm become manifest in the world; and that those entering the stream become manifest in the world, that once-returners become manifest in the world, that non-returners become manifest in the world, that arhats become manifest in the world, that pratyekabuddhas become manifest in the world, that bodhisattvas become manifest in the world; and that the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas become manifest in the world. Children of good family, it is thanks to bodhisattva great beings that food, drink, vehicles, clothing, bedding, houses, sustenance, jewels, pearls, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, gold, and silver also become manifest in the world. Children of good family, all the necessities for the happiness of beings, be they for the human condition, those which work as materials for the gods, or for the happiness of perfect separation, all these, too, become manifest in the world thanks to bodhisattva great beings.
“If you ask why, O noble children, when bodhisattva great beings practice the conduct of a bodhisattva, they dwell in the six perfections. They themselves practice generosity and they also connect others with generosity. They themselves maintain ethical discipline and they also connect others with ethical discipline. They themselves cultivate tolerance and they also connect others with tolerance. They themselves undertake perseverance and they also connect others with perseverance. They themselves develop meditative concentration, and they also connect others in meditative concentration. They themselves cultivate wisdom, and they also connect others with the cultivation of wisdom. It is thanks to bodhisattva great beings that beings practice the six perfections. Through practicing the six perfections, they will attain all mundane and supramundane excellences. So it is, children of good family, that bodhisattva great beings have set out for the benefit and happiness of all beings.” 
Thereupon the Blessed One extended his tongue from his mouth, covering this great billionfold world system. Then, manifold lights of many diverse colors issued forth from his tongue, and, having issued forth, they permeated the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; permeated the world systems in the direction of the nadir, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity; and permeated the world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great luminosity.
Then, when the bodhisattva great beings of those world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, saw that diffusion of light, they asked the blessed lord buddhas of their respective buddhafields, “Blessed Lord, whose power is this that causes these world systems to be filled with great light in this manner?” 
Those blessed lord buddhas replied, “O children of good family, in the western direction from here, there is a world system called Patient Endurance. There, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha named Śākyamuni resides. Extending the tongue from his mouth, he has suffused these world systems, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with great light in order to reveal the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings.”

Then those bodhisattva great beings said to those blessed lord buddhas, “Blessed Lord, since that is the case, we too should go to see that blessed lord, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Śākyamuni, to pay homage to him and venerate him, and also to see those bodhisattva great beings who have assembled from the ten directions, and to listen to the perfection of wisdom.” 
Those blessed lord buddhas replied, “Go then, you children of good family, if you feel it is timely.” 
Those bodhisattva great beings then bowed their heads toward the feet of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, and circumambulated them, keeping them to their right, seven times. From the ten directions they brought many parasols, victory banners, and flags of the gods; flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, robes, golden flowers, silver flowers, and so on; and approached the place where the blessed one, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Śākyamuni, was seated, with much singing and music, drums and cymbals.
Then the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, and the gods of the Trayastriṃśa, Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, Paranirmitavaśavartin, Brahmakāyika, Brahmapurohita, Brahma­pārṣadya, Mahābrahmā, Ābha, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, Ābhāsvara, Śubha, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, and Śubhakṛtsna, Vṛha, Parīttavṛha, Apramāṇavṛha and Vṛhatphala realms, as well as the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, Avṛha, Atapa, and Akaniṣṭha realms, also brought many divine flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, incense, and powders; divine blue lotuses, lotuses, red lotuses, and white lotuses; and divine mandārava, big mandārava, keśara flowers, and tamāla leaves, and approached the place where the blessed one, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Śākyamuni, was seated. There those bodhisattva great beings and those gods sprinkled and scattered over the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Śākyamuni those flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, incense, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags of the gods. Those flowers and so on, having ascended into the sky over that great billionfold world system, remained there, a mansion of flowers, square in shape, with four pillars, equidimensional, perfectly proportioned, delightful, and pleasant.
Thereupon, within that assembly, many hundreds of thousands of a hundred million billion living beings rose from their seats, placed the palms of their hands together, bowed toward the place where the Blessed One was seated, and made the following aspirational vow in the presence of the Blessed One: “Blessed Lord, in the future, may we too obtain all aspects of the attributes such as these that the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha has obtained. May we too convene a saṅgha of śrāvakas such as this. May we too teach the Dharma in an assembly like this, just as the Tathāgata is demonstrating the Dharma here at the present time.” 
Then the Blessed One, aware of the aspirational vow of those children of good families, and aware of their acceptance that phenomena are nonarising, do not cease, do not occasion anything, and do not appear, smiled. 
Thereupon, the venerable Ānanda, rising from his seat, with his upper robe over one shoulder, rested his right knee on the ground, and, placing his hands together in the gesture of homage to the Blessed One, bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, “Blessed Lord, since the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas do not smile without reason and circumstances, what is the reason and what are the circumstances for your smile?” 
The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, a hundred billion trillion living beings in this assembly have attained the acceptance that phenomena are nonarising. In the future, when sixty-eight ten million eons have passed, during the eon called Puṣpākara, they will all become manifest in the world as tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas named abhibodhyaṅga­puṣpa.”
This completes the second chapter, “Śāriputra,” from The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines. 
Chapter 3
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Subhūti: “Subhūti, commencing with the perfection of wisdom, be inspired to give a Dharma discourse to bodhisattva great beings on how bodhisattva great beings will go forth in the perfection of wisdom!”
Thereupon, those bodhisattva great beings, those great śrāvakas, and those gods who were present thought, “Will the venerable Subhūti reveal the perfection of wisdom to these bodhisattva great beings through the strong and mighty armor of his own wisdom and inspired eloquence, or will he reveal it through the power of the Buddha?” 
Then, through the power of the Buddha, the venerable Subhūti comprehended in his mind the thoughts of those bodhisattva great beings, those śrāvakas, and those gods, and said to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, whatever the śrāvakas of the Blessed One say, whatever they teach, and whatever they expound, it is all through the power of the Tathāgata. None of the doctrines that the Tathāgata has taught contradict the nature of reality. It is in this way that those children of good family are training in that Dharma teaching and also actualizing such a nature of reality. Śāradvatīputra, it is just the Tathāgata who, through skillful means, will teach the perfection of wisdom to bodhisattva great beings. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this teaching of the perfection of wisdom for bodhisattva great beings is not within the capacity of any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.”
The venerable Subhūti then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, you have spoken of ‘bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas,’ yet what is it that has the designation bodhisattva or perfection of wisdom? Blessed Lord, I do not observe any such ‘bodhisattva’ or ‘perfection of wisdom’ at all.
“Blessed Lord, since I do not observe those bodhisattva great beings, or that perfection of wisdom, or even that name ‘bodhisattva,’ which bodhisattva great beings should I teach and instruct, and in which perfection of wisdom?”
The Blessed One replied to the venerable Subhūti, “Subhūti, those—namely, the perfection of wisdom, a bodhisattva, and the term bodhisattva—are all mere names. These names neither exist internally nor do they exist externally, and they cannot be apprehended in the absence of the two.

“With regard to what you said, Subhūti, namely, ‘I do not observe any such phenomenon as a “bodhisattva,” ’ Subhūti, a mental phenomenon does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a mental phenomenon. Subhūti, a sensory element of sights does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of sights. Subhūti, a sensory element of feeling does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of feeling. Subhūti, a sensory element of perception does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of perception. Subhūti, a sensory element of formative predispositions does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of formative predispositions. Subhūti, a sensory element of consciousness does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of consciousness.
“Subhūti, a sensory element of the eyes does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of the eyes. Subhūti, a sensory element of the ears does not observe a sensory element of mental phenomena; a sensory element of mental phenomena does not observe a sensory element of the ears.

“Subhūti, a conditioned element does not observe an unconditioned element; an unconditioned element does not observe a conditioned element. Neither can an unconditioned element be designated without a conditioned element, nor can a conditioned element be designated without an unconditioned element. Accordingly, Subhūti, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe any phenomenon at all. Since they do not observe anything, they are not afraid, not frightened, and not terrified. They are not disheartened by anything. They are not regretful. If you ask why, Subhūti, it is because when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe physical forms, do not observe feelings, do not observe perceptions, do not observe formative predispositions, and do not observe consciousness; do not observe the eyes, do not observe the ears, do not observe the nose, do not observe the tongue, do not observe the body, and do not observe the mental faculty; do not observe sights, do not observe sounds, do not observe odors, do not observe tastes, do not observe tangibles, and do not observe mental phenomena; and do not observe the earth element, do not observe the water element, do not observe the fire element, do not observe the wind element, do not observe the space element, and do not observe the consciousness element. They do not observe ignorance, do not observe formative predispositions, do not observe consciousness, do not observe name and form, do not observe the six sense fields, do not observe sensory contact, do not observe sensation, do not observe craving, do not observe grasping, do not observe the rebirth process, do not observe birth, and do not observe aging and death. They do not observe attachment. They do not observe hatred or delusion. They do not observe the self. They do not observe a being, do not observe a life form, do not observe a living being, do not observe a life, do not observe an individual, do not observe a person, do not observe one born of Manu, do not observe a child of Manu, do not observe an agent, do not observe an instigator of an agent, do not observe an experiencer do not observe an instigator of an experiencer, do not observe a knower, and do not observe a viewer. They do not observe the realm of desire, do not observe the realm of form, and do not observe the realm of formlessness. They do not observe the mind of śrāvakas, do not observe the mind of pratyekabuddhas, and do not observe the mind of enlightenment. They do not observe śrāvakas. They do not observe the attributes of śrāvakas. They do not observe pratyekabuddhas. They do not observe the attributes of pratyekabuddhas. They do not observe bodhisattvas. They do not observe the attributes of bodhisattvas. They do not observe buddhas. They do not observe the attributes of buddhas. They do not observe enlightenment. They do not observe the attributes of enlightenment. They do not observe anything, up to and including all mundane and supramundane phenomena. Since they do not observe anything at all, they are not afraid, not frightened, and not terrified.”
“Blessed Lord, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, why does their mind not become disheartened or intimidated by all phenomena?” asked Subhūti.
The Blessed One replied, “Subhūti, it is because bodhisattva great beings do not observe the phenomena that are mind and mental factors. Therefore, Subhūti, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner, their mind does not become disheartened or intimidated by all phenomena.”
Subhūti asked, “Why does the mental faculty of bodhisattva great beings not become afraid?”
The Blessed One replied, “Subhūti, it is because bodhisattva great beings do not observe the mental faculty or the sensory element of the mental faculty. Therefore, Subhūti, the mental faculty of bodhisattva great beings does not become afraid. 
“Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should train in the perfection of wisdom accordingly by not apprehending anything at all. Subhūti, if, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not apprehend that perfection of wisdom, also do not apprehend a bodhisattva, also do not apprehend the term bodhisattva, and also do not apprehend the mind of enlightenment, then that itself is the teaching for bodhisattva great beings, that itself is the instruction.”

“Moreover, Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who wish to fulfill the aspirations of all beings should train in the perfection of wisdom. Furthermore, Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who wish to fulfill such roots of virtue that, when they have perfected those roots of virtue, they do not fall to the lower realms, are not born in inferior families, do not abide at the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas, and do not fall into the great immaturity bodhisattvas might have should train in the perfection of wisdom.” 
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra asked the venerable Subhūti, “How, Venerable Subhūti, do bodhisattva great beings fall into the great immaturity?”
The venerable Śāradvatīputra having spoken thus, the venerable Subhūti replied to him, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings who lack skill in means practice the six perfections, in doing so by basing themselves—due to their lack of skill in means—on the meditative stabilities of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, they do not regress to the level of śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas, but nor do they enter a bodhisattva’s full maturity. That is the immaturity of bodhisattva great beings.” 
“Venerable Subhūti, why is that the immaturity of bodhisattva great beings?”
Subhūti replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this ‘immaturity’ of bodhisattva great beings is craving for the Dharma.”
“What, Venerable Subhūti, is craving for the Dharma?” asked Śāradvatīputra.
Subhūti replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom and they become attached to, fixate on, and form the notion that physical forms are empty; become attached to, fixate on, and form the notion that feelings are empty; become attached to, fixate on, and form the notion that perceptions are empty; become attached to, fixate on, and form the notion that formative predispositions are empty; and become attached to, fixate on, and form the notion that consciousness is empty, this, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, is craving for the Dharma that is the fault that can come along with being a bodhisattva great being.

“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, if they become attached to, fixate on, and form the notion that these physical forms are to be renounced, and that they should renounce physical forms; that these feelings are to be renounced, and that they should renounce feelings; that these perceptions are to be renounced, and that they should renounce perceptions; that these formative predispositions should be renounced, and that they should renounce formative predispositions; that this consciousness should be renounced, and that they should renounce consciousness; that this suffering should be comprehended, and that they should comprehend suffering; that this cause of suffering should be renounced, and that they should renounce the cause of suffering; that this cessation should be actualized, and that they should actualize cessation; that this path should be cultivated, and that they should cultivate the path; that this is affliction and that is purification; that these attributes should be tended and those attributes should not be tended; that bodhisattva great beings should do this and should not do that; that this is the path of bodhisattva great beings and that is not the path; that this is the training of bodhisattva great beings and that is not the training; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of generosity and that is not the perfection of generosity; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of ethical discipline and that is not the perfection of ethical discipline; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of tolerance and that is not the perfection of tolerance; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of perseverance and that is not the perfection of perseverance; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of meditative concentration and that is not the perfection of meditative concentration; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of wisdom and that is not the perfection of wisdom; that this is the bodhisattva great beings’ skill in means and that is not skill in means; and that this is the maturity of bodhisattva great beings, and that is their immaturity, then this is craving for the Dharma that is the fault that can come along with being a bodhisattva great being.” 
“Venerable Subhūti, what is the maturity of a bodhisattva great being?”
Subhūti replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, in this regard, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe the emptiness of external phenomena in the emptiness of internal phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of internal phenomena in the emptiness of external phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of external and internal phenomena in the emptiness of external phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of external phenomena in the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of emptiness in the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of external and internal phenomena in the emptiness of emptiness, they do not observe the emptiness of great extent in the emptiness of emptiness, they do not observe the emptiness of emptiness in the emptiness of great extent, they do not observe the emptiness of ultimate reality in the emptiness of great extent, they do not observe the emptiness of great extent in the emptiness of ultimate reality, they do not observe the emptiness of conditioned phenomena in the emptiness of ultimate reality, they do not observe the emptiness of ultimate reality in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of conditioned phenomena in the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of the unlimited in the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena in the emptiness of the unlimited, they do not observe the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end in the emptiness of the unlimited, they do not observe the emptiness of the unlimited in the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, they do not observe the emptiness of nonexclusion in the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, they do not observe the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end in the emptiness of nonexclusion, they do not observe the emptiness of inherent nature in the emptiness of nonexclusion, they do not observe the emptiness of nonexclusion in the emptiness of inherent nature, they do not observe the emptiness of all phenomena in the emptiness of inherent nature, they do not observe the emptiness of inherent nature in the emptiness of all phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics in the emptiness of all phenomena, they do not observe the emptiness of all phenomena in the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, they do not observe the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended in the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, they do not observe the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics in the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, they do not observe the emptiness of nonentities in the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, they do not observe the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended in the emptiness of nonentities, they do not observe the emptiness of essential nature in the emptiness of nonentities, they do not observe the emptiness of nonentities in the emptiness of essential nature, they do not observe the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities in the emptiness of essential nature, and they do not observe the emptiness of essential nature in the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities.

“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they should not give rise to conceit even on account of the mind of enlightenment, nor should they give rise to conceit on account of the mind that is equal to the unequalled, nor should they give rise to conceit on account of the mind of vast extent. If you ask why, it is because that mind is not mind. The nature of the mind is luminosity.”

“Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” Subhūti asked in return, “if it is thus not mind, can existence or nonexistence be apprehended, or do they exist in that which is not mind?” 
“No, Venerable Subhūti,” he replied.
Subhūti then asked, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, if that which is not mind has neither existence nor nonexistence, and if it cannot be apprehended, how then, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, can you be correct in asking ‘Does this mind that is not the mind exist?’ ”
“Venerable Subhūti, what is that which is not the mind?”
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” replied Subhūti, “that which is not the mind is unchanging and without conceptual notions. That is the real nature of all phenomena. Therein there is no mind. This is said to be inconceivable.”

Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra said, “You have spoken well, Venerable Subhūti! Excellent, excellent, Venerable Subhūti! You are the son and heir of the Blessed Lord! Born from his mouth, arisen from the Dharma, emanated by the Dharma, inheritor of the Dharma, not an inheritor of material things, but an immediate physical eyewitness to the attributes of the buddhas. You are the one said by the Blessed Lord to be supreme among śrāvakas who practice without afflicted mental states, and this exposition of yours is reminiscent of that approach.
“Venerable Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should indeed train in accordance with the perfection of wisdom. It is through this that bodhisattva great beings are indeed understood to be irreversible. That is to say, one should know bodhisattva great beings not to be without the perfection of wisdom. 
“Venerable Subhūti, even those who wish to train on the level of the śrāvakas should earnestly study, should retain, should hold, should read aloud, should master, and should attend in the correct manner to this very perfection of wisdom. Even those who wish to train on the level of the pratyekabuddhas should earnestly study, should retain, should hold, should read aloud, should master, and should attend in the correct manner to this very perfection of wisdom. Even those who wish to train on the level of the bodhisattvas should earnestly study, should retain, should hold, should read aloud, should master, and should attend in the correct manner to this very perfection of wisdom. And even bodhisattva great beings who wish to train on the level of the buddhas should earnestly study, should retain, should hold, should read aloud, should master, and should attend in the correct manner to this very perfection of wisdom. If you ask why, it is because the three vehicles through which bodhisattva great beings, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas should train at all times, without interruption, are extensively taught therein.”
This completes the fourth chapter from The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines. 
Chapter 5
The venerable Subhūti then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, I thus do not apprehend and do not find a bodhisattva or the perfection of wisdom.

The unmistaken real nature is empty of the unmistaken real nature, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. The one and only real nature is empty of the one and only real nature, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. The reality of phenomena is empty of the reality of phenomena, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. The realm of phenomena is empty of the realm of phenomena, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. The abiding nature of phenomena is empty of the abiding nature of phenomena, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. The maturity of phenomena is empty of the maturity of phenomena, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. The very limit of reality is empty of the very limit of reality, and therein birth is not apprehended nor is emancipation apprehended. 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner are approaching all-aspect omniscience. Commensurate with their approach to all-aspect omniscience, they will attain complete purity of the body, complete purity of speech, complete purity of the mind, and complete purity of the major marks. Commensurate with their attainment of complete purity of the body, complete purity of speech, complete purity of the mind, and complete purity of the major marks, these bodhisattva great beings do not entertain thoughts of desire, and they do not entertain thoughts of hatred, do not entertain thoughts of delusion, do not entertain thoughts of pride, do not entertain thoughts of pretentiousness, do not entertain thoughts of deceit, do not entertain thoughts of envy, do not entertain thoughts of miserliness, do not entertain thoughts of craving, and do not entertain thoughts of mistaken views. Since they do not entertain thoughts of desire, and they do not entertain thoughts of hatred, delusion, pride, pretentiousness, deceit, envy, miserliness, craving, or mistaken views, they will never be conceived within a mother’s womb, and they will invariably be born miraculously. Except in order to bring beings to maturation, they will never be born in the inferior realms. They will proceed from one buddhafield to another buddhafield, bringing beings to maturation and refining the buddhafields. They will never be separated from the lord buddhas until they fully awaken in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“Therefore, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who wish to attain these attributes and excellences should practice this perfection of wisdom with unrelenting perseverance. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner are approaching all-aspect omniscience.”
