“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, these are the meditative stabilities of bodhisattva great beings. Through engaging with those meditative stabilities bodhisattva great beings will swiftly awaken fully to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. There are also countless and inestimable other meditative stabilities and dhāraṇī gateways, like these, having trained in which bodhisattva great beings will swiftly awaken fully to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.”
Then, through the power of the buddhas, the venerable Subhūti said, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past have indeed prophesied that those bodhisattva great beings who dwell in those meditative stabilities will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas presently residing and maintaining themselves in the world systems of the ten directions, numerous as the sand particles in the Gaṅgā River, also prophesy that those bodhisattva great beings will attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
“But still, those bodhisattva great beings do not even observe those meditative stabilities. They do not give rise to conceit on account of those meditative stabilities, thinking, ‘I have been absorbed in meditation. I am absorbed in meditation. I will be absorbed in meditation.’ Those conceptual imaginations are absent and will not arise.”
“Venerable Subhūti, are bodhisattva great beings who dwell in these meditative stabilities prophesied by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, they are not!” replied Subhūti. “If you ask why, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, it is because it is not that ‘the perfection of wisdom is one thing, the meditative stability another, and the bodhisattva yet another.’ Rather, the perfection of wisdom is itself the meditative stability, the meditative stability is itself the bodhisattva, and the bodhisattvas themselves are the meditative stability.”
“Venerable Subhūti, if it is because it is not that ‘the meditative stability is one thing, and the bodhisattva another,’ and it is not that ‘the bodhisattva is one thing, and the meditative stability another,’ which is to say, if the meditative stability is itself the bodhisattva, and the bodhisattvas are themselves the meditative stability owing to the sameness of all phenomena, is it then possible to teach the meditative stability?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, it is not!” replied Subhūti.
“Venerable Subhūti, do those children of good family perceive these meditative stabilities?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, they do not perceive them!” replied Subhūti.
“How do they not perceive them?” 
“Because they are without conceptual thought,” replied Subhūti.
“How are they without conceptual thought?” 
“They are without conceptual thought because all phenomena are nonexistent,” replied Subhūti. “So it is that those children of good family have no conceptual thoughts regarding those meditative stabilities. For this reason, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, those children of good family do not distinguish those meditative stabilities. They do not perceive them.”
“Why, Venerable Subhūti, do they not distinguish and not perceive them?” 
“They do not distinguish and do not perceive them because the meditative stabilities are nonexistent, and bodhisattva great beings, also, are nonexistent,” replied Subhūti.
Then the Blessed One congratulated the venerable Subhūti: “Excellent, excellent, Subhūti! You have spoken these words eloquently! This is an explanation by one whom I have declared to be supreme among śrāvakas abiding free of conflict. Bodhisattva great beings should also train in the perfection of wisdom in that manner. They should train in the perfection of meditative concentration, should train in the perfection of perseverance, should train in the perfection of tolerance, should train in the perfection of ethical discipline, and should train in the perfection of generosity; should train in the applications of mindfulness, should train in the correct exertions, should train in the supports for miraculous ability, should train in the faculties, should train in the powers, should train in the branches of enlightenment, and should train in the noble eightfold path; should train in the truths of the noble ones, should train in the meditative concentrations, should train in the immeasurable attitudes, should train in the formless absorptions, should train in the liberations, should train in the serial steps of meditative absorption, should train in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, should train in the extrasensory powers, should train in the meditative stabilities, and should train in the dhāraṇī gateways; and should train in the powers of the tathāgatas, should train in the fearlessnesses, should train in the kinds of exact knowledge, should train in great loving kindness, should train in great compassion, and should train in the distinct qualities of the buddhas.”
Then Venerable Śāradvatīputra asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, do bodhisattva great beings, training like that, train in the perfection of wisdom by way of not apprehending anything? Do they train in the perfection of meditative concentration by way of not apprehending anything? Do they train in the perfection of perseverance by way of not apprehending anything? Do they train in the perfection of tolerance by way of not apprehending anything? Do they train in the perfection of ethical discipline by way of not apprehending anything?

Do they train in great loving kindness by way of not apprehending anything? Do they train in great compassion by way of not apprehending anything? And do they train in the distinct qualities of the buddhas by way of not apprehending anything?”
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings, training like that, do train in the perfection of wisdom by way of not apprehending anything. They do train in the perfection of meditative concentration by way of not apprehending anything. They do train in the perfection of perseverance by way of not apprehending anything.

And they do train in the distinct qualities of the buddhas by way of not apprehending anything.
Then Venerable Śāradvatīputra asked, “Blessed Lord, why is it that they do not apprehend?” 
The Blessed One replied, “Owing to utter purity, they do not apprehend a self, do not apprehend a being, do not apprehend a life form, do not apprehend a living being, do not apprehend a life, do not apprehend an individual, do not apprehend a person, do not apprehend one born of Manu, do not apprehend a child of Manu, do not apprehend an agent, do not apprehend an experiencer, do not apprehend a knower, and do not apprehend a viewer.

“Blessed Lord, what is purity?” 
“That all phenomena are nonarising, unceasing, neither defiled nor purified, nonemerging, not apprehended, and unconditioned is called their purity,” replied the Blessed One. “Śāradvatīputra, so it is that bodhisattva great beings train with respect to all phenomena, by way of not apprehending anything.”
“Blessed Lord, in what phenomena do bodhisattva great beings who train like that then train?” 
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings who train like that do not train in anything at all. If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because these phenomena do not exist in the way that foolish ordinary people are fixated on them.”
“Blessed Lord, how then do these phenomena exist?” 
“As they do not exist, so do they exist. Because they thus do not exist, they are therefore said to be ‘nonexistent,’ ” replied the Blessed One.
“Blessed Lord,” he asked, “why are the nonexistent said to be ‘nonexistent’?”

“If you ask why, Subhūti, it is because all those phenomena—that enlightenment, that bodhisattva, and that actual entity denoted by the word bodhisattva—are neither conjoined nor disjoined, and are immaterial, impossible to indicate, unobstructed, and have only one defining characteristic, which is to say, they are without defining characteristics. Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should train in the fact that all phenomena are falsehoods. Bodhisattva great beings should know all phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are all phenomena? Blessed Lord, how do bodhisattva great beings train in falsehoods? How will bodhisattva great beings know all phenomena?”
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding ‘all phenomena,’ they are virtuous or nonvirtuous, determinate or indeterminate, mundane or supramundane, contaminated or uncontaminated, conditioned or unconditioned, a basic transgression or not a basic transgression, and common or uncommon. Subhūti, these are called all phenomena. Bodhisattva great beings should train in the fact that all those phenomena are false. Those are all the phenomena that bodhisattva great beings should indeed know.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the mundane virtuous phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding ‘mundane virtuous phenomena,’ they are respect for one’s father, respect for one’s mother, respect for a virtuous ascetic, respect for those born as priests, acts of service undertaken on behalf of elderly family members, bases of meritorious deeds originating from generosity, bases of meritorious deeds originating from ethical discipline and originating from meditation, and bases from having carried out one’s assigned duty, the path of the ten virtuous actions, the nine mundane perceptions—namely, the perception of [a corpse as] bloated, the perception of it as worm-infested, the perception of it as putrefied, the perception of it as bloodied, the perception of it as black and blue, the perception of it as chewed on, the perception of it as dismembered, the perception of it as bones, and the perception of it as immolated—the four mundane meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the five extrasensory powers, and the ten mundane mindfulnesses—namely, mindfulness of the Buddha, mindfulness of the Dharma, mindfulness of the Saṅgha, mindfulness of ethical discipline, mindfulness of giving away, mindfulness of the gods, mindfulness of the inhalation and exhalation of breath, mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of disillusionment, and mindfulness of death. These are called mundane virtuous phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the mundane nonvirtuous phenomena?” 
“The mundane nonvirtuous phenomena are the paths of the ten nonvirtuous actions,” replied the Blessed One. “That is to say, Subhūti, the slaying of living creatures is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Stealing, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Sexual misconduct because of lust, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Lying, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Slander, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Verbal abuse, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Irresponsible chatter, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Coveting, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Bearing malice, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. Wrong view, Subhūti, is a mundane nonvirtuous phenomenon. And, Subhūti, anger, holding a grudge, hypocrisy, nursing pent-up anger, violence, jealousy, miserliness, pride, and perverse pride—these are mundane nonvirtuous phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the mundane indeterminate phenomena?” 
“Physical actions are indeterminate,” replied the Blessed One. “Verbal actions are indeterminate. Mental actions are indeterminate. The four primary elements are indeterminate. The five sense faculties are indeterminate. The six sense fields are indeterminate. The four formless absorptions are indeterminate. The aggregates are indeterminate. The sensory elements are indeterminate. The sense fields are indeterminate. All the maturations are indeterminate. Subhūti, these are called mundane indeterminate phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the mundane phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘mundane phenomena,’ they are the five aggregates, the twelve sense fields, the eighteen sensory elements, the path of the ten virtuous actions, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the five extrasensory powers, and whatever other mundane phenomena there may be that are not supramundane phenomena. These are called mundane phenomena.” 
“Blessed Lord, what are the supramundane phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘supramundane phenomena,’ they are the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous abilities, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; the emptiness gateway to liberation, signlessness gateway to liberation, and wishlessness gateway to liberation; the faculty of coming to fully understand what has not been understood, the faculty of fully understanding, and the faculty of knowing one has fully understood; the meditative stability with an initial mental application and with a sustained mental application, the meditative stability without an initial mental application but with just a sustained mental application, and the meditative stability without an initial mental application and without a sustained mental application; knowledge, freedom, mindfulness, alertness, and appropriate attention; and the eight liberations.
“If you ask what these eight are, those with physical forms observe physical forms. This is the first liberation. Those with the perception of no internal physical forms observe external physical forms. This is the second liberation. They are intent on pleasant states. This is the third liberation. Having completely transcended the perception of physical forms so that perceptions of obstruction have subsided, those who do not direct their attention to perceptions of diversity achieve and dwell in the sphere of infinite space, thinking, ‘Space is infinite.’ This is the fourth liberation. Having completely transcended the sphere of infinite space in all respects, they achieve and dwell in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite.’ This is the fifth liberation. Having completely transcended the sphere of infinite consciousness in all respects, they achieve and dwell in the sphere of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ This is the sixth liberation. Having completely transcended the sphere of nothing-at-all in all respects, they achieve and dwell in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception. This is the seventh liberation. Having completely transcended the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception in all respects, they achieve and dwell in the cessation of perceptions and feelings. This is the eighth liberation. Those are the eight liberations. 
“And there are the nine serial steps of meditative absorption. If you ask what these nine are, they are as follows. [Practitioners] achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration that is detached from sense objects, detached from negative and nonvirtuous attributes, has an initial mental application and a sustained mental application, and is endowed with the joy and the bliss that arise from detachment. Having pacified the initial mental application and the sustained mental application, with inner serene confidence—which is to say, a mind that has become single-pointed—they achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration endowed with the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability. On account of having no attachment to the joy, dwelling with mindfulness and alertness in equanimity they experience the bliss with their bodies and achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration devoid of joy about which the noble ones say, ‘They are mindful, abiding in bliss, and equanimous.’ On account of having earlier abandoned the bliss, abandoned suffering, and caused mental happiness and mental unhappiness to subside, they achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration without bliss and suffering, and in which equanimity and mindfulness are utterly purified. Having completely transcended the perception of physical forms so that perceptions of obstruction have subsided, those who do not direct their attention to perceptions of diversity achieve and maintain the sphere of infinite space, thinking, ‘Space is infinite.’ Having completely transcended the sphere of infinite space in all respects, they achieve and maintain the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite.’ Having completely transcended the sphere of infinite consciousness in all respects, they achieve and maintain the sphere of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ Having completely transcended the sphere of nothing-at-all in all respects, they achieve and dwell in the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception. Having completely transcended the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception in all respects, they achieve and maintain the cessation of perceptions and feelings.
“So, those nine serial steps of meditative absorption, and the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities, as well as the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas—these are called supramundane phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the contaminated phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘contaminated phenomena,’ they are the five aggregates, the twelve sense fields, the eighteen sensory elements, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, and the five extrasensory powers. These are called contaminated phenomena.” 
“Blessed Lord, what are the uncontaminated phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘uncontaminated phenomena,’ they are the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous abilities, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, and the four truths of the noble ones, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, all the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. These are called uncontaminated phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the conditioned phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘conditioned phenomena,’ they are the realm of desire, the realm of form, the realm of formlessness, and the other phenomena apart from these that are included in the sphere of conditioned phenomena—the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous abilities, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, and the four truths of the noble ones, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, the five extrasensory powers, the six perfections, all the emptinesses, all the meditative stabilities, all the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. These are called conditioned phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the unconditioned phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘unconditioned phenomena,’ they are those that do not arise, disintegrate, and transform, which is to say, the extinction of desire, the extinction of hatred, the extinction of delusion, the real nature, the unmistaken real nature, the one and only real nature, the reality of phenomena, the realm of phenomena, the maturity of phenomena, the realm of the inconceivable, and the very limit of reality. These, Subhūti, are called unconditioned phenomena.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the common phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘common phenomena,’ they are the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, and the five extrasensory powers. These are called phenomena shared in common with ordinary persons.”
“Blessed Lord, what are the uncommon phenomena?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding those called ‘uncommon phenomena,’ they are the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous abilities, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, and the four truths of the noble ones, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, all the meditative stabilities, all the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. These are called uncommon phenomena.”
“Since bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom are without ideation, they should not become attached to any of those phenomena that are empty of their own defining characteristics. Since they are without ideation and without conceptual thought, they should comprehend all phenomena in accordance with nonduality.” 
Then Venerable Subhūti asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, why, when you say ‘bodhisattva great beings,’ do you call bodhisattvas ‘great beings’?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattvas are called great beings because they will lead a great number of beings with certainty to consummation.”
“Blessed Lord, who are such a great number of beings with certainty, such a great number of beings with certainty, that bodhisattva great beings will lead to consummation? 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “regarding that great number of beings—those on the level of the spiritual family, those who are the eighth, those who have entered the stream, once-returners, non-returners, arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have initially set their minds on enlightenment, up to bodhisattva great beings who dwell on the level at which progress has become irreversible—they, Subhūti, are called the great number of beings with certainty. Those bodhisattva great beings will lead such beings as those to consummation. There the bodhisattva great beings’ setting of the vajra-like mind on enlightenment is called the consummation of the great number of beings with certainty.”
“Blessed Lord, what is this setting of the vajra-like mind on enlightenment?” 
“Here, Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings set their minds on enlightenment, thinking, ‘I should don armor for the sake of all beings in inestimable saṃsāra. I should renounce all possessions. I should develop equanimity toward all beings. I should enable all beings to attain final nirvāṇa by means of the three vehicles. I should understand that despite enabling all beings to attain final nirvāṇa, since there are indeed no beings who will attain final nirvāṇa, all phenomena are nonarising and unceasing. I should practice the six perfections with the unadulterated mind of all-aspect omniscience. I should train in the realization of the [ultimate] attribute that is followed everywhere by completion. I should comprehend the accomplishment of the attributes in a single principle. I should train in order to achieve all the inestimable attributes.’ They set their mind in that way. Subhūti, that is the bodhisattva great beings’ setting of the vajra-like mind on enlightenment. Keeping to it, without apprehending anything, bodhisattva great beings lead the great number of beings with certainty to consummation.
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings set their minds in this way: ‘For the sake of all those beings I should experience all those feelings of suffering, the suffering that the denizens of the hells, the animal realm, and the world of Yama, as many as there are, feel.’ On top of that, bodhisattva great beings set their minds in this way, thinking, ‘Even for the sake of each being, individually, over many hundreds of thousands of tens of millions of billions of eons, I should experience all those sufferings of the denizens of the hells as long as a being has not attained final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the aggregates is left behind.’ In just that way, ‘For the sake of all beings, I should also experience all those sufferings of the denizens of the hells as long as all beings have not passed into final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the aggregates is left behind.’ And from then on, they will set their mind, thinking, ‘For my own sake, I should plant the roots of virtue, and, after many hundreds of thousands of tens of millions of billions of eons accumulating manifold provisions of enlightenment, I should fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ Subhūti, that is the bodhisattva great beings’ setting of the vajra-like mind. Keeping to it, without apprehending anything, bodhisattva great beings lead the great number of beings with certainty to consummation.
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should always and uninterruptedly develop a sublime mind, a sublime mind on account of which all beings will be led to consummation. In this regard, the sublime mind of bodhisattva great beings is, from the time when they first set their mind on enlightenment, not having a greedy mind, not having a hateful mind, not having a deluded mind, not setting their mind on harming, not having a śrāvaka’s mind, and not having a pratyekabuddha’s mind. This is the sublime mind of bodhisattva great beings. Through that sublime mind they lead all beings to their consummation, but still they should not give rise to conceits because of that.
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should have an unshakeable mind. In this regard, the unshakeable mind of bodhisattva great beings is attention turned toward all-aspect omniscience without giving rise to conceit because of that. This is the unshakeable mind of bodhisattva great beings. Through that, without apprehending anything, they will lead all beings to consummation.
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should set their mind on the benefit and happiness of all beings. In this regard, the bodhisattva great beings’ mind set on benefit and happiness is a refuge to all beings, and does not abandon them, but without giving rise to conceit because of that. This, Subhūti, is the bodhisattva great beings’ mind set on benefit and happiness. Keeping to it, without apprehending anything, bodhisattva great beings lead the great number of beings with certainty to consummation. 
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should always and uninterruptedly wish for the Dharma, enjoy Dharma, appreciate the Dharma, and practice and engage in having an appreciation for the Dharma. In this regard, if you ask what is Dharma, it is this: the indivisibility of all dharmas. 
“If you ask what it is to wish for the Dharma, it is to wish for and appreciate the Dharma. That is called to wish for the Dharma.
“If you ask what it is to enjoy the Dharma, it is to enjoy and take pleasure in the Dharma. That is called to enjoy the Dharma.

“If you ask what it is to practice and engage in having an appreciation for the Dharma, it is to cultivate and magnify just that Dharma. That is called to practice and engage in having an appreciation for the Dharma.
“In this way, Subhūti, without apprehending anything, bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom should lead the great number of beings with certainty to consummation.

“Abiding in these attributes, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom and lead the great number of beings with certainty to consummation. This is why bodhisattvas are called great beings.” 
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, I too am inspired to say in what sense bodhisattvas are called great beings.” 
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “be inspired to speak of why bodhisattvas are called great beings.”
Śāradvatīputra then explained, “Blessed Lord, although bodhisattva great beings teach the Dharma to beings in order that they might abandon the view of the self; might abandon the view of a being; might abandon the view of a life form; might abandon the view of a person; might abandon the view of a life; might abandon the view of an individual; might abandon the view of one born of Manu; might abandon the view of a child of Manu; might abandon the view of an agent; might abandon the view of an instigator of an agent; might abandon the view of a motivator; might abandon the view of an inciter; might abandon the view of an experiencer; might abandon the view of an instigator of an experiencer; might abandon the view of a knower; and might abandon the view of a viewer; might abandon the nihilist view and might abandon the eternalist view; might abandon the view of existence and might abandon the view of nonexistence; might abandon the view of aggregates, might abandon the view of sensory elements, and might abandon the view of sense fields; might abandon the view of dependent origination; might abandon the view of the truths; might abandon the view of the perfections; might abandon the view of emptiness; might abandon the view of the applications of mindfulness, might abandon the view of the correct exertions, might abandon the view of the supports for miraculous ability, might abandon the view of the faculties, might abandon the view of the powers, might abandon the view of the branches of enlightenment, and might abandon the view of the noble eightfold path; might abandon the view of the truths of the noble ones; might abandon the view of the meditative concentrations, might abandon the view of the immeasurable attitudes, might abandon the view of the formless absorptions, might abandon the view of the liberations, and might abandon the view of the serial steps of meditative absorption; might abandon the view of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation; might abandon the view of the extrasensory powers; might abandon the view of the meditative stabilities and might abandon the view of the dhāraṇī gateways; might abandon the view of the powers of the tathāgatas, might abandon the view of the fearlessnesses, might abandon the view of the kinds of exact knowledge, might abandon the view of great loving kindness, might abandon the view of great compassion, and might abandon the view of the distinct qualities of the buddhas; might abandon the view of beings to be matured; might abandon the view of buddhafields to be refined; might abandon the view of enlightenment; might abandon the view of the Buddha, might abandon the view of the Dharma, and might abandon the view of the Saṅgha; might abandon the view of the turning of the wheel of the Dharma; and, although they teach the Dharma to beings in order that they might abandon the view of the attainment of final nirvāṇa, they do so by way of not apprehending anything. This is why bodhisattvas are called great beings.”

for these reasons they have a view concerning the truths of the noble ones, a view concerning the meditative concentrations, a view concerning the immeasurable attitudes, a view concerning the formless absorptions, a view concerning the liberations, a view concerning the serial steps of meditative absorption, a view concerning the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, a view concerning the extrasensory powers, a view concerning the meditative stabilities, and a view concerning the dhāraṇī gateways; for these reasons they have a view concerning the powers of the tathāgatas, a view concerning the fearlessnesses, a view concerning the kinds of exact knowledge, a view concerning great loving kindness, a view concerning great compassion, and a view concerning the distinct qualities of the buddhas; and for these reasons they have a view concerning the beings to be matured, a view concerning the buddhafields to be refined, a view concerning enlightenment, a view concerning the Buddha, a view concerning the Dharma, a view concerning the Saṅgha, a view concerning the turning of the wheel of the Dharma, and a view concerning the attainment of final nirvāṇa. However, in this regard, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom with skill in means they teach the Dharma, without apprehending anything, in order that those views might be abandoned.
Then the venerable Subhūti said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, I too am inspired to say why a bodhisattva is called a great being.” 
“Subhūti, be inspired to speak of that!” replied the Blessed One.
Subhūti then explained, “Blessed Lord, they are without attachment even to such a mind as the mind set on enlightenment that is equal to the unequaled and is not shared in common with any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. It is for that reason bodhisattvas are called great beings. If you ask why, it is because the mind set on omniscience is free from contaminants and not part of the three realms. So, owing to its emptiness of inherent nature, they are not attached even to that mind—that mind set on omniscience that is free from contaminants and that is not part of the three realms. That is why bodhisattvas are reckoned to be great beings.”
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra asked the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable Subhūti, what is the mind of bodhisattva great beings that is equal to the unequaled, and that is not shared in common with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?” 
“In this regard, Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” replied Subhūti,” bodhisattva great beings, starting from the time when they first set their mind on enlightenment, do not observe any phenomenon at all that is arising, and they do not observe any phenomenon at all that is ceasing, increasing or decreasing, coming or going, defiled or purified. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, in that [mind] that has no arising, no ceasing, no increasing, no decreasing, no coming, no going, no defilement, and no purification there is no mind of the śrāvakas, no mind of the pratyekabuddhas, no mind of the bodhisattvas, and no mind of the perfectly complete buddhas. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this is the mind of bodhisattva great beings—equal to the unequaled, and not shared in common with all śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.”
“Venerable Subhūti, you said, ‘They are not attached even to that mind—that mind set on omniscience, free from contaminants and not part of the three realms,’ so would it not be the case, Venerable Subhūti, that physical forms would therefore be without attachment, that feelings would be without attachment, that perceptions would be without attachment, that formative predispositions would be without attachment, and that consciousness would be without attachment;

“Venerable Subhūti, you said, ‘That mind set on omniscience is free from contaminants and not part of the three realms,’ so, Venerable Subhūti, in that case not only that, but also would the minds of ordinary persons be free from contaminants and not part of the three realms, owing to their emptiness of inherent nature? Would the minds of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, as well as the minds of the lord buddhas, also be free from contaminants and not part of the three realms, owing to their emptiness of inherent nature?”
“They are, Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” replied Subhūti. “The minds of ordinary persons are also free from contaminants and not part of the three realms, owing to the emptiness of inherent nature.

Śāradvatīputra then asked, “Venerable Pūrṇa, to what extent is it said that bodhisattva great beings ‘have entered upon the Great Vehicle,’ and what is the Great Vehicle of the bodhisattva great beings?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” replied Pūrṇa, “here bodhisattva great beings who practice the six perfections, while practicing the perfection of generosity, achieve and then maintain the first meditative concentration that is detached from sense objects, detached from negative and nonvirtuous attributes, has an initial mental application and a sustained mental application, and is endowed with the joy and the bliss that arise from detachment. Having pacified the initial mental application and the sustained mental application, with inner serene confidence—which is to say, a mind that has become single-pointed—they achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration endowed with the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability. On account of having no attachment to the joy, dwelling with mindfulness and alertness in equanimity they experience the bliss with their bodies and achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration devoid of joy, about which the noble ones say, ‘They are mindful, abiding in bliss, and equanimous.’ On account of having earlier abandoned the bliss, abandoned suffering, and caused mental happiness and mental unhappiness to subside, with equanimity and mindfulness they achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration without bliss and suffering.

“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings permeate the world systems in the ten directions, within the whole infinity of the realm of phenomena and the very reaches of the realm of space, with a mind endowed with a loving kindness that is vast, extensive, nondual, immeasurable, without enmity, free from harm, without rivalry, perfected, and well cultivated, remaining intent on and maintaining it. They permeate the world systems in the ten directions, within the whole infinity of the realm of phenomena and the very reaches of the realm of space, with a mind endowed with a compassion that is vast, extensive, nondual, immeasurable, without enmity, free from harm, without rivalry, perfected, and well cultivated, remaining intent on and maintaining it. They permeate the world systems in the ten directions, within the whole infinity of the realm of phenomena and the very reaches of the realm of space, with a mind endowed with an empathetic joy that is vast, extensive, nondual, immeasurable, without enmity, free from harm, without rivalry, perfected, and well cultivated, remaining intent on and maintaining it. They permeate the world systems in the ten directions, within the whole infinity of the realm of phenomena and the very reaches of the realm of space, with a mind endowed with an equanimity that is vast, extensive, nondual, immeasurable, without enmity, free from harm, without rivalry, perfected, and well cultivated, remaining intent on and maintaining it.
“They achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration that is detached from sense objects, detached from negative and nonvirtuous attributes, has an initial mental application and a sustained mental application, and is endowed with the joy and the bliss that arise from detachment. Having pacified the initial mental application and the sustained mental application, with inner serene confidence—which is to say, a mind that has become single-pointed—they achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration endowed with the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability. On account of having no attachment to the joy, dwelling with mindfulness and alertness in equanimity they experience the bliss with their bodies and achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration devoid of joy, about which the noble ones say, ‘They are mindful, abiding in bliss, and equanimous.’ On account of having earlier abandoned the bliss, abandoned suffering, and caused mental happiness and mental unhappiness to subside, with equanimity and mindfulness they achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration without bliss and suffering.
“Having completely transcended the perception of physical forms so that perceptions of obstruction have subsided, they do not direct their attention to diverse perceptions and achieve and maintain the sphere of infinite space, thinking, ‘Space is infinite.’ Having completely transcended the sphere of infinite space in all respects, they achieve and maintain the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite.’ Having completely transcended the sphere of infinite consciousness in all respects, they achieve and maintain the sphere of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ Having completely transcended the sphere of nothing-at-all, they achieve and maintain the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception by way of not apprehending anything. This is the meditative stability of bodhisattva great beings.
“Moreover, bodhisattva great beings, with their minds directed toward all-aspect omniscience, preceded by great compassion, describe, explain, teach, interpret, analyze, and elucidate these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions to others so that they might abandon afflicted mental states, and they correctly teach their savor, their defects, and the release from them. This is the perfection of generosity of bodhisattva great beings. 
“Once bodhisattva great beings, with their attentions directed toward all-aspect omniscience, are absorbed in these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, even when they arise from them they do not allow an opportunity for the development of any other śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha setting of the mind. This is the unblemished perfection of ethical discipline of bodhisattva great beings.
“When bodhisattva great beings, with their attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, dwell in these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, they think, ‘I will teach the Dharma in order that the afflicted mental states of all beings might be ended.’ This enduring, appreciating, scrutinizing, contemplating, and comprehending of thinking and paying attention like that is the perfection of tolerance of bodhisattva great beings.
“When bodhisattva great beings, with their attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, dwell in these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, their perseverance for the welfare of all beings and all-aspect omniscience does not decline. This is the perfection of perseverance of bodhisattva great beings.
“When bodhisattva great beings, with their attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, become absorbed in, and also when they arise from, these meditative concentrations, liberations, meditative stabilities, and absorptions, they do not descend to the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. This is the perfection of meditative concentration of bodhisattva great beings.
“Even while bodhisattva great beings, with their attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, definitively discern these branches of the first meditative concentration, branches of the second meditative concentration, branches of the third meditative concentration, and branches of the fourth meditative concentration; loving kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity; the sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, the sphere of nothing-at-all, and the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception through the impermanence aspect, through the suffering aspect, through the selflessness aspect, through the peaceful aspect, through the emptiness aspect, through the signlessness aspect, and through the wishlessness aspect, they do not apprehend these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, and they do not give rise to conceits on the basis of them. This is the perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, regarding the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings, they cultivate in all respects the four applications of mindfulness, they cultivate in all respects the four correct exertions, they cultivate in all respects the four supports for miraculous abilities, they cultivate in all respects the five faculties, they cultivate in all respects the five powers, they cultivate in all respects the seven branches of enlightenment, and they cultivate in all respects the noble eightfold path; they cultivate in all respects the truths of the noble ones, they cultivate in all respects the meditative concentrations, they cultivate in all respects the immeasurable attitudes, they cultivate in all respects the formless absorptions, they cultivate in all respects the liberations, they cultivate in all respects the serial steps of meditative absorption, they cultivate in all respects the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, they cultivate in all respects the extrasensory powers, they cultivate in all respects the meditative stabilities, and they cultivate in all respects the dhāraṇī gateways; they cultivate in all respects the powers of the tathāgatas, they cultivate in all respects the fearlessnesses, they cultivate in all respects the kinds of exact knowledge, they cultivate in all respects great loving kindness, they cultivate in all respects great compassion, and they cultivate in all respects the distinct qualities of the buddhas; and they cultivate in all respects knowledge of all the dharmas, they cultivate in all respects knowledge of the aspects of the path, and they cultivate in all respects all-aspect omniscience. This, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings become absorbed in the meditative stability of loving kindness and apply themselves diligently to it, thinking, ‘I should save all beings.’ They become absorbed in the meditative stability of compassion and feel compassion and empathy for beings. They become absorbed in the meditative stability of empathetic joy and bring beings to mind with the thought, ‘I should liberate all beings.’ They become absorbed in the meditative stability of equanimity and apply themselves diligently to the cessation of the contaminants of beings. This is the perfection of generosity of bodhisattva great beings who practice the immeasurable attitudes.
“When bodhisattva great beings are absorbed in, and also when they arise from, the aspects, tokens, and signs of these meditative concentrations and immeasurable attitudes, they do not dedicate these to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas, and instead only dedicate them to all-aspect omniscience. This is the unblemished perfection of ethical discipline of bodhisattva great beings who practice the immeasurable attitudes.
“Once bodhisattva great beings dwell in the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes, and the formless absorptions, without mixing them up, and do not develop a desire for those two levels—the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas—but aspire to and delight in all-aspect omniscience, this is the perfection of tolerance possessed by bodhisattva great beings who practice the immeasurable attitudes.
“Once bodhisattva great beings, with their minds set on and directed to all-aspect omniscience, act without giving up the attempt to abandon nonvirtuous actions and excel in virtuous actions, this is the perfection of perseverance of bodhisattva great beings who practice the immeasurable attitudes.
“Once bodhisattva great beings are absorbed in these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, but are not subject to rebirth on account of these meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, and do not relish them and are not captivated by them, this is the perfection of meditative concentration of bodhisattva great beings who practice the immeasurable attitudes. 
“When bodhisattva great beings, with their attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, are absorbed in, and arise from, those meditative concentrations, immeasurable attitudes, and formless absorptions, they definitively discern them through the impermanence aspect, through the suffering aspect, through the selflessness aspect, through the peaceful aspect, through the emptiness aspect, through the signlessness aspect, and through the wishlessness aspect, and yet they do not enter either into the maturity of the śrāvakas or the pratyekabuddhas. This is the perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings who practice the immeasurable attitudes. This, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings. 
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is to understand the emptiness of internal phenomena, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of external phenomena, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of emptiness, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of great extent, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of ultimate reality, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of the unlimited, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of nonexclusion, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of inherent nature, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of all phenomena, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of nonentities, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; to understand the emptiness of essential nature, but in a manner that does not apprehend anything; and to understand the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities but in a manner that does not apprehend anything. This, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings. 
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is to understand that the mind is undistracted and absorbed with respect to all phenomena. This, venerable Śāradvatīputra, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is not to engage in understanding anything as ‘permanent,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘impermanent,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘happiness,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘suffering,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘self’ and not to engage in understanding anything as ‘nonself,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘pleasant’ and not to engage in understanding anything as ‘unpleasant,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘empty’ and not to engage in understanding anything as ‘not empty,’ not to engage in understanding anything as ‘having a sign’ and not to engage in understanding anything as ‘signless,’ and not to engage in understanding anything as ‘with wishes’ and not to engage in understanding anything as ‘wishless.’ This, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, in a manner that does not apprehend anything, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is the understanding that does not engage with past time, the understanding that does not engage with future time, and the understanding that does not cause engagement with present time, but, by way of not apprehending past, future, or present time, in it there is not even not understanding past, future, or present time. This, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, by way of not apprehending it, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is the understanding that does not cause engagement with the realm of desire, and is the understanding that does not cause engagement with the world systems of form and formlessness, yet is not even not understanding the three world systems of desire, form, and formlessness. This, too, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, by way of not apprehending it, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is the understanding that does not cause engagement with mundane phenomena, and is the understanding that does not cause engagement with supramundane, contaminated or uncontaminated, or conditioned or unconditioned phenomena, yet is not even not knowing mundane and supramundane phenomena and is not even not knowing contaminated or uncontaminated, or conditioned or unconditioned phenomena. This, too Venerable Śāradvatīputra, by way of not apprehending it, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.”
“Venerable Pūrṇa, to what extent is it said that bodhisattva great beings ‘are mounted upon the Great Vehicle’?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” replied Pūrṇa, “here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are also mounted on the perfection of generosity, but they do not apprehend gifts, they do not apprehend the perfection of generosity, they do not apprehend the bodhisattvas, they do not apprehend the recipients, nor do they apprehend paying attention. It is in this way, by way of not apprehending anything, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the perfection of generosity.’
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are also mounted on the perfection of ethical discipline, but they do not apprehend ethical discipline, they do not apprehend the perfection of ethical discipline, they do not apprehend the bodhisattvas, nor do they apprehend paying attention. It is in this way, by way of not apprehending anything, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the perfection of ethical discipline.’ Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are also mounted on the perfection of tolerance, but they do not apprehend tolerance, they do not apprehend the perfection of tolerance, they do not apprehend the bodhisattvas, nor do they apprehend paying attention. It is in this way, by way of not apprehending anything, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the perfection of tolerance.’ Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are also mounted on the perfection of perseverance, but they do not apprehend perseverance, they do not apprehend the perfection of perseverance, they do not apprehend the bodhisattvas, nor do they apprehend paying attention. It is in this way, by way of not apprehending anything, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the perfection of perseverance.’ Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are also mounted on the perfection of meditative concentration, but they do not apprehend meditative concentration, they do not apprehend the perfection of meditative concentration, they do not apprehend the bodhisattvas, nor do they apprehend paying attention. It is in this way, by way of not apprehending anything, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the perfection of meditative concentration.’ Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they are also mounted on the perfection of wisdom, but they do not apprehend virtuous phenomena; they do not apprehend nonvirtuous, mundane, supramundane, conditioned, unconditioned, contaminated, or uncontaminated phenomena; they do not apprehend the perfection of wisdom; they do not apprehend the bodhisattvas; nor do they apprehend paying attention. It is in this way, by way of not apprehending anything, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the perfection of wisdom.’
“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings, with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, meditate on the emptiness of internal phenomena in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of external phenomena in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of external and internal phenomena in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of emptiness in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of great extent in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of ultimate reality in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of conditioned phenomena in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of the unlimited in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of nonexclusion in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of inherent nature in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of nonentities in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of essential nature in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything; and with an undivided attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience meditate on the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities in order to cultivate meditation, and do so by way of not apprehending anything.

It is in this way, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, that bodhisattva great beings are said to be ‘mounted on the Great Vehicle.’

“Moreover, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings, commencing from the time when they first set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the site of enlightenment, perfect all the extrasensory powers and bring beings to maturity. In order to serve, respect, honor, and worship the lord buddhas by the appropriate means of worshiping and serving them, they proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield. They listen to just this doctrine of this Bodhisattva Vehicle, in the presence of those lord buddhas. Having mounted on this Bodhisattva Vehicle, they proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield. They refine a buddhafield and bring beings to maturity, but they are without even the notion of a buddhafield, they are without even the notion of beings, and they are without even the notion of a buddha. Abiding on the level of nonduality, they acquire at will as many bodily forms as will facilitate their appropriate acts for the welfare of beings. Until they attain the knowledge of one with all-aspect omniscience, they will never be separated from that vehicle.

“Subhūti, if, as an analogy, an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist, standing at a crossroads, in the presence of a large gathering of people, were to conjure up the hells, the animal realms, and the Yama worlds, and, having conjured them up in that manner, were to proclaim the word Buddha, proclaim the word Dharma, and proclaim the word Saṅgha to those beings in those inferior realms, causing those they have conjured up to arise from the hells, the animal realms, and the Yama worlds through the word Buddha, the word Dharma, and the word Saṅgha, do you think, Subhūti, that this illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist would have caused any beings to arise from the hells, the animal realms, or the Yama worlds?” 
“No, Blessed Lord,” answered Subhūti.
“In the same way, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “although bodhisattva great beings have liberated immeasurable, countless beings in the world systems of the ten directions from the three inferior realms, there are no beings at all who have been liberated. If you ask why, Subhūti, it is because this is just the way things are, given the illusory nature of phenomena. It is in this way, Subhūti, that bodhisattva great beings are said to have ‘donned the great armor.’
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings who have donned the great armor dwell in the perfection of generosity and emanate a great billionfold world system made of beryl. Having emanated it made of beryl in that manner, they emanate the dominion of a wheel-turning emperor. Having emanated the dominion of an imperial monarch in that manner, they give food to those in need of nourishment, and they give drink to those in need of drink, give vehicles to those in need of vehicles, give clothing to those in need of clothing, give flowers to those in need of flowers, give garlands to those in need of garlands, give incense to those in need of incense, give unguents to those in need of unguents, give lodgings to those in need of lodgings, give homes to those in need of homes, give sustenance to those in need of sustenance, give resources to those in need of resources, give medications to those in need of medications owing to ill health, and give gems, pearls, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, gold, and silver to those who need gems, pearls, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, gold, and silver, up to giving whatever resources might be needed. Having given food to those in need of nourishment, given drink to those in need of drink, given vehicles to those in need of vehicles, given clothing to those in need of clothing, given flowers to those in need of flowers, given garlands to those in need of garlands, given incense to those in need of incense, given unguents to those in need of unguents, given lodgings to those in need of lodgings, given homes to those in need of homes, given sustenance to those in need of sustenance, given resources to those in need of resources, given medications to those in need of medications owing to ill health, and given gems, pearls, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, gold, and silver to those who need gems, pearls, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, gold, and silver, up to having given whatever resources might be needed, they then teach those beings the Dharma—just this Dharma endowed with the six perfections. Those beings, too, on hearing this Dharma, will never be separated from the six perfections until they have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.

“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings dwell in the perfection of ethical discipline and intentionally take birth in the family of an imperial monarch. Dwelling as mighty lords in the family of an imperial monarch, they establish beings on the path of the ten virtuous actions.

If you ask why, Subhūti, it is because this is just the way things are, given the illusory nature of phenomena. It is in this way, Subhūti, that bodhisattva great beings are said to have ‘donned the great armor.’
“Moreover, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings dwelling in the perfection of tolerance unite all beings with the perfection of tolerance and establish them in it. Subhūti, if you ask in what way bodhisattva great beings, dwelling in the perfection of tolerance, unite all beings with the perfection of tolerance and establish them in it, in this regard, Subhūti, commencing from the time when they first set their mind on enlightenment, bodhisattva great beings don their armor, thinking, ‘I should not let my mind become disturbed even just a bit, even once, even if all beings hit me with stones and sticks, or strike me with weapons,’ and they also establish all beings in such tolerance.
“Subhūti, if, as an analogy, an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist, standing at a crossroads, in the presence of a large gathering of people, were to conjure up a large gathering of people, uniting them with the perfection of tolerance and establishing them in it, do you think, Subhūti, that this illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist would have established any beings in the perfection of tolerance?”

Subhūti, if you ask in what way bodhisattva great beings dwelling in the perfection of meditative concentration encourage, secure, and establish all beings in the perfection of wisdom, Subhūti, here, when those bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not apprehend any phenomena that may be arising or ceasing, defiled or purified, proximate or remote.

And I must establish them in all-aspect omniscience,’ do you think, Subhūti, that this illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist would have established any beings in the six perfections, would have established them in the eighteen emptinesses, would have established them in the four applications of mindfulness, would have established them in the four correct exertions, would have established them in the four supports for miraculous ability, would have established them in the five faculties, would have established them in the five powers, would have established them in the seven branches of enlightenment, would have established them in the noble eightfold path, would have established them in the four truths of the noble ones, would have established them in the four meditative concentrations, would have established them in the four immeasurable attitudes, would have established them in the four formless absorptions, would have established them in the eight liberations, would have established them in the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, would have established them in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, would have established them in the five extrasensory powers, would have established them in all the meditative stabilities, would have established them in the dhāraṇī gateways, would have established them in the ten powers of the tathāgatas, would have established them in the four fearlessnesses, would have established them in the four kinds of exact knowledge, would have established them in great compassion, would have established them in the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, would have established them in the fruit of those who have entered the stream, would have established them in the fruit of once-returners, would have established them in the fruit of non-returners, would have established them in arhatship, would have established them in individual enlightenment, would have established them in the knowledge of the aspects of the path, or would have established them in all-aspect omniscience?”
“No, Blessed Lord,” answered Subhūti.
“In the same way, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings set their minds on establishing immeasurable, countless beings in the six perfections, set their minds on establishing them in the eighteen emptinesses, set their minds on establishing them in the four applications of mindfulness, set their minds on establishing them in the four correct exertions, set their minds on establishing them in the four supports for miraculous ability, set their minds on establishing them in the five faculties, set their minds on establishing them in the five powers, set their minds on establishing them in the seven branches of enlightenment, set their minds on establishing them in the noble eightfold path, set their minds on establishing them in the four truths of the noble ones, set their minds on establishing them in the four meditative concentrations, set their minds on establishing them in the four immeasurable attitudes, set their minds on establishing them in the four formless absorptions, set their minds on establishing them in the eight liberations, set their minds on establishing them in the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, set their minds on establishing them in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, set their minds on establishing them in the five extrasensory powers, set their minds on establishing them in all the meditative stabilities, set their minds on establishing them in the dhāraṇī gateways, set their minds on establishing them in the ten powers of the tathāgatas, set their minds on establishing them in the four fearlessnesses, set their minds on establishing them in the four kinds of exact knowledge, set their minds on establishing them in great compassion, set their minds on establishing them in the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, set their minds on establishing them in the fruit of those who have entered the stream, set their minds on establishing them in the fruit of once-returners, set their minds on establishing them in the fruit of non-returners, set their minds on establishing them in arhatship, set their minds on establishing them in individual enlightenment, set their minds on establishing them in the knowledge of the aspects of the path, or and set their minds on establishing them in all-aspect omniscience, but they do not set their minds [on those] for the sake of any beings at all. If you ask why, Subhūti, it is because this is just the way things are, given the illusory nature of phenomena. It is in this way, Subhūti, that bodhisattva great beings are said to have ‘donned the great armor.’ ”
Subhūti then said, “As I understand the meaning of what the Blessed Lord has said, bodhisattva great beings should know that they have donned armor that is a nonexistent armor, on account of the emptiness of its intrinsic defining characteristics. If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because physical forms are empty of physical forms, feelings are empty of feelings, perceptions are empty of perceptions, formative predispositions are empty of formative predispositions, and consciousness is empty of consciousness.

Blessed Lord, bodhisattvas are also empty of bodhisattvas. The great armor is also empty of the great armor. It is for that reason, Blessed Lord, that bodhisattva great beings should know that they have donned armor that is a nonexistent armor.” 
“Subhūti, it is just as you have said,” replied the Blessed One. “It is so. It is so. If you ask why, Subhūti, it is because all-aspect omniscience has neither been created, nor been developed, nor been composed. Even the beings for whom bodhisattva great beings have donned the great armor have neither been created, nor been developed, nor been composed.” 
“Blessed Lord, for what reason has all-aspect omniscience neither been created, nor been developed, nor been composed? Why have the beings for whom bodhisattva great beings have donned the great armor neither been created, nor been developed, nor been composed?”

Where does this vehicle come to rest? Who will go forth in this vehicle?”
The Blessed One said to Venerable Subhūti, “Subhūti, you have asked, ‘Lord, what is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings?’ Subhūti, the six perfections are the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings. If you ask what these six are, they are the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom.
“Subhūti, here bodhisattva great beings, with their attention directed toward all-aspect omniscience, give inner or outer objects as gifts to those who want them, and, making common cause with all beings, without apprehending anything, dedicate the merit to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. This is the perfection of generosity of bodhisattva great beings.”
“Blessed Lord, what is the perfection of ethical discipline of bodhisattva great beings?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “here bodhisattva great beings, with their mind set on and directed toward all-aspect omniscience, themselves adopt and maintain correctly the path of the ten virtuous actions. They also induce other beings to adopt the path of the ten virtuous actions, secure and establish them in that, and they do so without apprehending anything. This is the unblemished perfection of ethical discipline of bodhisattva great beings.”
“Blessed Lord, what is the perfection of tolerance of bodhisattva great beings?”

They also induce others to become tolerant, and they do so without apprehending anything. This is the perfection of tolerance of bodhisattva great beings.”
“Blessed Lord, what is the perfection of perseverance of bodhisattva great beings?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “here bodhisattva great beings, with their mind set on and directed toward all-aspect omniscience, do not themselves give up persevering at the six perfections. They also connect others with the six perfections, and they do so without apprehending anything. This is the perfection of perseverance of bodhisattva great beings.”
“Blessed Lord, what is the perfection of meditative concentration of bodhisattva great beings?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “here bodhisattva great beings, with their mind set on and directed toward all-aspect omniscience, are skillfully absorbed in the meditative concentrations but will not be subject to rebirth on account of them. They also induce others to become absorbed in the meditative concentrations, and they do so without apprehending anything. This is the perfection of meditative concentration of bodhisattva great beings.”
“Blessed Lord, what is the perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One,” here bodhisattva great beings, with their mind set on and directed toward all-aspect omniscience, themselves are without fixation with respect to all phenomena, and by way of not apprehending anything discern the nature of all phenomena. They also induce other beings to adopt nonfixation with respect to all phenomena and to discern the nature of all phenomena, they secure and establish them in that, and they do so by way of not apprehending anything. This is the perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings. 
“This, Subhūti, is the Great Vehicle of bodhisattva great beings.
