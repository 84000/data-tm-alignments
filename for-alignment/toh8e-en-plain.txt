Chapter 17 Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that bodhisattva great beings who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom acquire these attributes that may be attained in this lifetime; that they bring beings to maturation, refine a buddhafield, proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield to wait on the lord buddhas, and that the roots of virtue through which they seek to serve, respect, honor, and worship those lord buddhas are excellent; that their memory of the Dharmas that they hear from those lord buddhas does not weaken until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; that they acquire the excellence of family, acquire the excellence of birth, acquire the excellence of lifespan, acquire the excellence of retinue, acquire the excellence of the major marks, acquire the excellence of luminosity, acquire the excellence of the eyes, acquire the excellence of voice, acquire the excellence of meditative stability, and acquire the excellence of dhāraṇī; that through skillful means they emanate themselves in the body of a buddha, journey from world system to world system, and having gone to places where a lord buddha has not arisen and appeared, describe the attributes of the perfection of generosity, describe the attributes of the perfection of ethical discipline, describe the attributes of the perfection of tolerance, describe the attributes of the perfection of perseverance, describe the attributes of the perfection of meditative concentration, and describe the attributes of the perfection of wisdom; describe the attributes of the emptiness of internal phenomena, describe the attributes of the emptiness of external phenomena, describe the attributes of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, describe the attributes of the emptiness of emptiness, describe the attributes of the emptiness of great extent, describe the attributes of the emptiness of ultimate reality, describe the attributes of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, describe the attributes of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, describe the attributes of the emptiness of the unlimited, describe the attributes of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, describe the attributes of the emptiness of nonexclusion, describe the attributes of the emptiness of inherent nature, describe the attributes of the emptiness of all phenomena, describe the attributes of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, describe the attributes of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, describe the attributes of the emptiness of nonentities, describe the attributes of the emptiness of essential nature, and describe the attributes of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; describe the attributes of the four meditative concentrations, describe the attributes of the four immeasurable attitudes, describe the attributes of the four formless absorptions, and describe the attributes of the five extrasensory powers; describe the attributes of the four applications of mindfulness, describe the attributes of the four correct exertions, describe the attributes of the four supports for miraculous ability, describe the attributes of the five faculties, describe the attributes of the five powers, describe the attributes of the seven branches of enlightenment, and describe the attributes of the noble eightfold path; describe the attributes of the four truths of the noble ones, describe the attributes of the eight liberations, describe the attributes of the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, describe the attributes of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, describe the attributes of the meditative stabilities, describe the attributes of the dhāraṇī gateways, describe the attributes of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, describe the attributes of the four fearlessnesses, describe the attributes of the four kinds of exact knowledge, describe the attributes of great loving kindness, describe the attributes of great compassion, and describe the attributes of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; and that through skillful means they teach beings the Dharma and discipline them in the three vehicles, namely, the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, and the vehicle of the buddhas.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that when this perfection of wisdom is acquired, all the six perfections are acquired; the emptiness of internal phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of external phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of emptiness is acquired, the emptiness of great extent is acquired, the emptiness of ultimate reality is acquired, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of the unlimited is acquired, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is acquired, the emptiness of nonexclusion is acquired, the emptiness of inherent nature is acquired, the emptiness of all phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics is acquired, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended is acquired, the emptiness of nonentities is acquired, the emptiness of essential nature is acquired, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities is acquired; the applications of mindfulness are acquired, the correct exertions are acquired, the supports for miraculous ability are acquired, the faculties are acquired, the powers are acquired, the branches of enlightenment are acquired, and the noble eightfold path is acquired; the truths of the noble ones are acquired, the meditative concentrations are acquired, the immeasurable attitudes are acquired, the formless absorptions are acquired, the liberations are acquired, the serial steps of meditative absorption are acquired, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation are acquired, the extrasensory powers are acquired, the meditative stabilities are acquired, the dhāraṇī gateways are acquired, the powers of the tathāgatas are acquired, the fearlessnesses are acquired, the kinds of exact knowledge are acquired, great loving kindness is acquired, great compassion is acquired, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are acquired; and the fruit of having entered the stream is acquired, the fruit of once-returner is acquired, the fruit of non-returner is acquired, arhatship is acquired, individual enlightenment is acquired, the knowledge of the aspects of the path is acquired, and all-aspect omniscience is acquired.” 
Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, having said this, the Blessed One then said to him, “Kauśika, it is so, it is so! 
By acquiring this perfection of wisdom, all the six perfections are acquired; the emptiness of internal phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of external phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of emptiness is acquired, the emptiness of great extent is acquired, the emptiness of ultimate reality is acquired, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of the unlimited is acquired, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is acquired, the emptiness of nonexclusion is acquired, the emptiness of inherent nature is acquired, the emptiness of all phenomena is acquired, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics is acquired, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended is acquired, the emptiness of nonentities is acquired, the emptiness of essential nature is acquired, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities is acquired; the applications of mindfulness are acquired, the correct exertions are acquired, the supports for miraculous ability are acquired, the faculties are acquired, the powers are acquired, the branches of enlightenment are acquired, and the noble eightfold path is acquired; the truths of the noble ones are acquired, the meditative concentrations are acquired, the immeasurable attitudes are acquired, the formless absorptions are acquired, the liberations are acquired, the serial steps of meditative absorption are acquired, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation are acquired, the extrasensory powers are acquired, the meditative stabilities are acquired, the dhāraṇī gateways are acquired, the powers of the tathāgatas are acquired, the fearlessnesses are acquired, the kinds of exact knowledge are acquired, great loving kindness is acquired, great compassion is acquired, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas are acquired; and the fruit of having entered the stream is acquired, the fruit of once-returner is acquired, the fruit of non-returner is acquired, arhatship is acquired, individual enlightenment is acquired, the knowledge of the aspects of the path is acquired, and all-aspect omniscience is acquired. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, listen extremely well and focus your attention, because I will reveal whichever attributes those sons or daughters of good families will acquire in this lifetime when they take up, affirm, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom.” 
“Blessed Lord, I will do so,” said Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, and he listened to the Blessed One. 
The Blessed One then said to him, “Kauśika, if there are any rival tīrthikas, tīrthika practitioners, wandering mendicants, māras, gods included among the class of māras, or arrogant individuals who want to dispute this perfection of wisdom, who want to cause separation from it, who want to quarrel with it, or who want to contradict it, then whatever disputations, causes for separation, quarrels, and contradictions have come about from those who want to dispute, those who want to cause separation, those who want to quarrel, and those who want to contradict will swiftly subside and become nonexistent, and the intentions of those who delight in disputation, who delight in causing separation, who delight in quarreling, and who delight in contradiction will not be fulfilled. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of generosity, practice the perfection of ethical discipline, practice the perfection of tolerance, practice the perfection of perseverance, practice the perfection of mediative concentration, and practice the perfection of wisdom over a long period of time, bodhisattva great beings have forsaken those outer and inner phenomena on account of which beings have, over a long period of time, become involved in fights, quarrels, altercations, and gratuitous insults, and they have established those beings in the perfection of generosity. 
It is because bodhisattva great beings have forsaken those outer and inner phenomena on account of which beings have, over a long period of time, become involved in immorality, and they have established those beings in the perfection of ethical discipline. 
It is because bodhisattva great beings have forsaken those outer and inner phenomena on account of which beings have, over a long period of time, become angry, malicious, and violent, and they have established those beings in the perfection of tolerance. 
It is because bodhisattva great beings have forsaken those outer and inner phenomena on account of which beings have, over a long period of time, become indolent, and they have established those beings in the perfection of perseverance. 
It is because bodhisattva great beings have forsaken those outer and inner phenomena on account of which beings have, over a long period of time, become mentally distracted, and they have established those beings in the perfection of meditative concentration. 
And it is because bodhisattva great beings have forsaken those outer and inner phenomena on account of which beings have, over a long period of time, become intellectually stupid, and they have established those beings in the perfection of wisdom. 
“Kauśika, it is because bodhisattva great beings have eliminated the latent impulses and obsessions—those latent impulses and obsessions on account of which beings wander in saṃsāra—and they have encouraged beings to take up the four meditative concentrations. 
It is because they have encouraged them to take up the four immeasurable attitudes, because they have encouraged them to take up the four formless absorptions, because they have encouraged them to take up the five extrasensory powers, because they have encouraged them to take up the four applications of mindfulness, because they have encouraged them to take up the four correct exertions, because they have encouraged them to take up the four supports for miraculous ability, because they have encouraged them to take up the five faculties, because they have encouraged them to take up the five powers, because they have encouraged them to take up the seven branches of enlightenment, because they have encouraged them to take up the noble eightfold path, because they have encouraged them to take up the four truths of the noble ones, because they have encouraged them to take up the eight liberations, because they have encouraged them to take up the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, because they have encouraged them to take up the three gateways to liberation, because they have encouraged them to take up all the meditative stabilities, because they have encouraged them to take up all the dhāraṇī gateways, because they have encouraged them to take up the ten powers of the tathāgatas, because they have encouraged them to take up the four fearlessnesses, because they have encouraged them to take up the four kinds of exact knowledge, because they have encouraged them to take up great loving kindness, because they have encouraged them to take up great compassion, because they have encouraged them to take up the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, because they have encouraged them to take up the fruit of having entered the stream, because they have encouraged them to take up the fruit of once-returner, because they have encouraged them to take up the fruit of non-returner, because they have encouraged them to take up arhatship, because they have encouraged them to take up individual enlightenment. 
It is because they have encouraged them to take up unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Kauśika, in those lives when bodhisattva great beings practice the conduct of a bodhisattva in that manner, they come to have those attributes. 
In another life, too, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, they turn the wheel of the Dharma and, having established beings in accord with their vowed aspiration, they then attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no aggregates are left behind. 
Those, Kauśika, are the attributes and advantages that will come about in another life of the bodhisattva great beings. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, in the vicinity of a place where sons or daughters of good families take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, no māras, or gods included among the class of māras, or rival tīrthikas, or wandering mendicants, or arrogant individuals will be able to come into the vicinity of that place to dispute, or quarrel with, or contradict, or destroy this perfection of wisdom. 
In addition to that, they will have these attributes and advantages: by hearing, taking up, and cultivating this perfection of wisdom they will be emancipated in the three vehicles and put an end to suffering. 
“Kauśika, there is an herb called maghī that alleviates all poisons. 
As an analogy, if a snake or creature, feeling famished, seeking food, were to see another creature, and in order to eat that creature pursue it, and if that other creature, while being pursued, in fear of death and in terror, were to go to a place where there is the herb maghī, then that snake would turn back simply on smelling the herb. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the herbal attributes of maghī would overpower the venom of the snake. 
Kauśika, such is the potency of the herb maghī. 
Similarly, Kauśika, whatever the disputes and quarrels and contradicting of any sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, they would all be pacified and eliminated by the brilliance of the perfection of wisdom and by the power of the perfection of wisdom. 
Wherever they arise, they would be eliminated in that very place and they would not increase. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the perfection of wisdom pacifies all negative and nonvirtuous phenomena and does not allow them to increase. 
“If you ask what all the negative and nonvirtuous phenomena are that the perfection of wisdom pacifies and does not allow to increase, it pacifies desire, hatred, and delusion and does not allow them to increase.

“Kauśika, this perfection of wisdom pacifies all those negative and nonvirtuous phenomena and does not allow them to increase. 
“Kauśika, all the gods in this billionfold world system, as many as there are––the Four Great Kings; Śakra, the mighty lord of the gods; Brahmā, the lord of Patient Endurance; and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realms, the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realms, the gods of the Vṛhatphala realms, and the gods in the Śuddhāvāsa realms—will indeed always guard, protect, and defend without interruption those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. 
“Those lord buddhas who reside and maintain themselves in the world systems of the ten directions will also indeed always guard, protect, and defend without interruption those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. 
They will abandon nonvirtuous phenomena and increase virtuous phenomena.

When they practice the six perfections, they cultivate wisdom, making common cause with all beings, and dedicate to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment without apprehending anything. 
“When sons or daughters of good families practice the six perfections in that manner, a recollection will arise: ‘If I do not undertake acts of generosity, I will be reborn in the series of terrible forms of life, I will not bring beings to maturation, I will not refine a buddhafield, and I will not attain all-aspect omniscience. 
If I do not guard ethical discipline, I will be reborn in the three terrible forms of life, I will not acquire a human body, I will not bring beings to maturation, I will not refine a buddhafield, and I will not attain all-aspect omniscience. 
If I do not cultivate tolerance, I will have diminished sense faculties, my facial complexion will be lackluster, and I will not acquire an excellent form, which is to say, I will not have the excellent form such as that which, when I practice the conduct of a bodhisattva, as soon as beings see it they come to have no doubt about unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and in the absence of which excellent form I will not bring beings to maturation, I will not refine a buddhafield, and I will not attain all-aspect omniscience. 
If I am indolent, I cannot attain the path to enlightenment, I will not bring beings to maturation, I will not refine a buddhafield, and I will not attain all-aspect omniscience. 
If my mind is agitated, I cannot develop such meditative stabilities as those through which beings are brought to maturation, I will not refine a buddhafield, and I will not attain all-aspect omniscience. 
If I am intellectually stupid, after transcending the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas through wisdom and skillful means, I will not be able to bring beings to maturation, I will not refine a buddhafield, and I will not attain all-aspect omniscience.’ 
“Thinking thus they will correctly train in that manner, and this recollection will arise: ‘It would not be right and it would not be proper were I not to complete the perfection of generosity on account of the power of miserliness; it would not be right and it would not be proper were I not to complete the perfection of ethical discipline on account of the power of immorality; it would not be right and it would not be proper were I not to complete the perfection of tolerance on account of the power of malice; it would not be right and it would not be proper were I not to complete the perfection of perseverance on account of the power of indolence; it would not be right and it would not be proper were I not to complete the perfection of meditative concentration on account of the power of distraction; and it would not be right and it would not be proper were I not to complete the perfection of wisdom on account of the power of intellectual stupidity. 
Without completing the six perfections, I will not be emancipated in all-aspect omniscience! 
Without completing the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom, I will not be emancipated in all-aspect omniscience!’ 
“So, Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and who are not separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, will attain these enlightened attributes in this lifetime and in other lives.” 
Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, then said, “Blessed Lord, it is wonderful that this perfection of wisdom has been established in that manner in order that bodhisattva great beings will become disciplined and will not be proud.” 
“Kauśika, how has this perfection of wisdom been established in order that bodhisattva great beings will become disciplined and will not be proud?” 
asked the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord,” replied Śakra, “here when bodhisattva great beings are practicing the mundane perfection of generosity and undertake an act of generosity toward the lord buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, and śrāvakas, if they think, ‘I am undertaking an act of generosity toward the lord buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, and śrāvakas, and toward the poor, the destitute, the supplicants, and beggars,’ on account of that act of generosity lacking in skillful means they are proud.

“Blessed Lord, when bodhisattva great beings practice mundane phenomena in that manner, they are proud because they are attached to their ego. 
The perfection of wisdom has been established for them in order that they will become disciplined and will not be proud. 
“Blessed Lord, here, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of supramundane generosity, in order to cultivate the perfection of wisdom to its utmost, they do not apprehend the act of generosity, nor do they apprehend the undertaking of it, nor do they apprehend the recipient.

This completes the seventeenth chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.” 
Chapter 18 Then the Blessed One said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, when any sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, chant by heart, and focus their attention correctly on this profound perfection of wisdom are present in a place of conflict, in the frontline of battle, if those sons or daughters of good families have gone there and are present there having chanted this profound perfection of wisdom by heart, then those sons or daughters of good families will not be defeated. 
They will indisputably be victorious. 
Being victorious, they will be delivered from that conflict without being humiliated or injured. 
“Kauśika, when any sons or daughters of good families, chanting this profound perfection of wisdom by heart, have gone into the frontline of battle, it is impossible that there would be a hindrance to their lives. 
It is impossible and it does not happen. 
If someone were to shoot arrows at their bodies or strike at them with weapons, their bodies would not be struck or pierced. 
If you ask why, it is because those sons or daughters of good families have practiced the six perfections for a long time. 
They have relied on this very perfection of wisdom. 
They have cultivated this very perfection of wisdom. 
They have subdued the weapons of their own desire and also the arrows of their own desire. 
They have subdued the weapons of others’ desire and also the arrows of others’ desire. 
They have subdued the weapons of their own hatred and also the arrows of their own hatred. 
They have subdued the weapons of others’ hatred and also the arrows of others’ hatred. 
They have subdued the weapons of their own delusion and also the arrows of their own delusion. 
They have subdued the weapons of others’ delusion and also the arrows of others’ delusion. 
They have subdued the weapons of their own wrong views and also the arrows of their own wrong views. 
They have subdued the weapons of others’ wrong views and also the arrows of others’ wrong views. 
They have subdued the weapons of their own obsessions and also the arrows of their own obsessions. 
They have subdued the weapons of others’ obsessions and also the arrows of others’ obsessions. 
They have subdued the weapons of their own latent impulses and also the arrows of their own latent impulses. 
They have subdued the weapons of others’ latent impulses and also the arrows of others’ latent impulses. 
“Therefore, Kauśika, when sons or daughters of good families go into battle, their bodies will not be struck or pierced by weapons or arrows. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, if sons or daughters of good families who are not separated from the mind of omniscience take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this profound perfection of wisdom, whether somebody were to sprinkle poison on them, put a curse on them, roast them in a firepit, strike them with weapons, give them poison to drink, or try to drown them, all that would not harm them. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because this perfection of wisdom is the great knowledge incantation. 
Kauśika, it is because this perfection of wisdom is the unsurpassed knowledge incantation. 
Kauśika, it is because this perfection of wisdom is the unexcelled knowledge incantation. 
Sons or daughters of good families who train in this knowledge incantation do not harm themselves, nor do they harm others, nor do they harm both. 
“If you ask why, it is because when they train in it, they do not apprehend the self, do not apprehend a being, do not apprehend a life form, do not apprehend a living being, do not apprehend life, do not apprehend an individual, do not apprehend a person, do not apprehend one born of Manu, do not apprehend a child of Manu, do not apprehend an agent, do not apprehend an experiencer, do not apprehend a knower, and do not apprehend a viewer; they do not apprehend physical forms, do not apprehend feelings, do not apprehend perceptions, do not apprehend formative predispositions, and do not apprehend consciousness; they do not apprehend the eyes, do not apprehend the ears, do not apprehend the nose, do not apprehend the tongue, do not apprehend the body, and do not apprehend the mental faculty; they do not apprehend sights, do not apprehend sounds, do not apprehend odors, do not apprehend tastes, do not apprehend tangibles, and do not apprehend mental phenomena; they do not apprehend visual consciousness, do not apprehend auditory consciousness, do not apprehend olfactory consciousness, do not apprehend gustatory consciousness, do not apprehend tactile consciousness, and do not apprehend mental consciousness; they do not apprehend visually compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend aurally compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend nasally compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend lingually compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend corporeally compounded sensory contact, and do not apprehend mentally compounded sensory contact; they do not apprehend feelings conditioned by visually compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by aurally compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by nasally compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by lingually compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by corporeally compounded sensory contact, and do not apprehend feelings conditioned by mentally compounded sensory contact; they do not apprehend the earth element, do not apprehend the water element, do not apprehend the fire element, do not apprehend the wind element, do not apprehend the space element, and do not apprehend the consciousness element; they do not apprehend ignorance, do not apprehend formative predispositions, do not apprehend consciousness, do not apprehend name and form, do not apprehend the six sense fields, do not apprehend sensory contact, do not apprehend sensation, do not apprehend craving, do not apprehend grasping, do not apprehend the rebirth process, do not apprehend birth, and do not apprehend aging and death; they do not apprehend the perfection of generosity, do not apprehend the perfection of ethical discipline, do not apprehend the perfection of tolerance, do not apprehend the perfection of perseverance, do not apprehend the perfection of meditative concentration, and do not apprehend the perfection of wisdom; they do not apprehend the emptiness of internal phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of external phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of emptiness, do not apprehend the emptiness of great extent, do not apprehend the emptiness of ultimate reality, do not apprehend the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of the unlimited, do not apprehend the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, do not apprehend the emptiness of nonexclusion, do not apprehend the emptiness of inherent nature, do not apprehend the emptiness of all phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, do not apprehend the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, do not apprehend the emptiness of nonentities, do not apprehend the emptiness of essential nature, and do not apprehend the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; they do not apprehend the applications of mindfulness, do not apprehend the correct exertions, do not apprehend the supports for miraculous ability, do not apprehend the faculties, do not apprehend the powers, do not apprehend the branches of enlightenment, and do not apprehend the noble eightfold path; and they do not apprehend the truths of the noble ones, do not apprehend the meditative concentrations, do not apprehend the immeasurable attitudes, do not apprehend the formless absorptions, do not apprehend the liberations, do not apprehend the serial steps of meditative absorption, do not apprehend the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, do not apprehend the extrasensory powers, do not apprehend the meditative stabilities, do not apprehend the dhāraṇī gateways, do not apprehend the powers of the tathāgatas, do not apprehend the fearlessnesses, do not apprehend the kinds of exact knowledge, do not apprehend great loving kindness, do not apprehend great compassion, do not apprehend the distinct qualities of the buddhas, do not apprehend the fruit of having entered the stream, do not apprehend the fruit of once-returner, do not apprehend the fruit of non-returner, do not apprehend arhatship, do not apprehend individual enlightenment, do not apprehend knowledge of all the dharmas, do not apprehend the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and do not apprehend all-aspect omniscience. 
“Since they do not apprehend in that manner, and are not harming themselves, or harming others, or harming both, they attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and observe the minds of all beings. 
If you ask why, it is because those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past also trained in this same knowledge incantation and fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the future will also train in this same knowledge incantation and will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; and those present tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas are also training in this same knowledge incantation and fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, even if this perfection of wisdom is not taken up, upheld, recited, or mastered, and attention is not correctly focused on it, in the house, village, town, or city where it is committed to writing and upheld, humans or nonhumans looking for an opportunity to inflict harm will not find an opportunity to inflict harm. 
If you ask why, it is because, in order to worship this perfection of wisdom, the gods in the billionfold world system––the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm; the gods of the Ābha realm, the gods of the Parīttābha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm; the gods of the Śubha realm, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm; the gods of the Vṛha realm, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm; and the gods of the Avṛha realm, the gods of the Atapa realm, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, the gods of the Sudarśana realm, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm—and the gods of immeasurable, countless other world systems––the gods of their Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of their Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of their Yāma realm, the gods of their Tuṣita realm, the gods of their Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of their Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of their Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of their Brahmapurohita realm, the gods of their Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the gods of their Mahābrahmā realm; the gods of their Ābha realm, the gods of their Parīttābha realm, the gods of their Apramāṇābha realm, and the gods of their Ābhāsvara realm; the gods of their Śubha realm, the gods of their Parīttaśubha realm, the gods of their Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the gods of their Śubhakṛtsna realm; the gods of their Vṛha realm, the gods of their Parīttavṛha realm, the gods of their Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the gods of their Vṛhatphala realm; and the gods of their Avṛha realm, the gods of their Atapa realm, the gods of their Sudṛśa realm, the gods of their Sudarśana realm, and the gods of their Akaniṣṭha realm, as many as there are—will always guard, protect, and defend without interruption those sons or daughters of good families who have committed this perfection of wisdom to writing and uphold it. 
Having arrived there, those gods will serve, respect, honor, and worship this perfection of wisdom and then depart. 
Kauśika, so it is that any of those who have committed to writing and uphold this perfection of wisdom will have such attributes and advantages in this life. 
“Kauśika, to illustrate, the site of enlightenment, or the living creatures included as animals or human beings present in the vicinity of the site of enlightenment or within the site of enlightenment, cannot be harmed or injured by humans or nonhumans. 
If you ask why, it is because, seated thereon, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; seated right there, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the future will also fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; and seated right there, the present tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas in the world systems of the ten directions are also fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
And all those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and having worked hard to make all beings fearless, and free from and not consumed with enmity, have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in the excellent condition of gods and humans; have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in the fruit of having entered the stream; have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in the fruit of once-returner; have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in the fruit of non-returner; have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in arhatship; have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in individual enlightenment; and have established, are establishing, and will establish immeasurable, countless beings in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because this very perfection of wisdom has made that location on the earth into a caitya for all beings, which is to be prostrated before, bowed down to, honored, served, and respected with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, and victory banners.” 
Śakra then asked, “Blessed Lord, if any son or daughter of a good family were to commit this perfection of wisdom to writing, uphold it in the form of a book, and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags, and if another were to place and cherish the bodily relics of a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha who has passed into nirvāṇa within a caitya fashioned of the seven precious materials, or within a container fashioned of the seven precious materials, and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags, which of these two would increase their stock of merit more?” 
The Blessed One replied, “In that case, Kauśika, I will ask just you a counter-question on this matter and you should answer as best you can. 
Kauśika, on which path do you think the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas who have acquired all-aspect omniscience and who have manifested such a body trained, such that the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have acquired all-aspect omniscience and manifested such a body?” 
Śakra answered, “Blessed Lord, it is after training in this very perfection of wisdom that the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have acquired all-aspect omniscience and also manifested such a body.” 
“Kauśika, it is so, it is so!” 
replied the Blessed One. 
“I also acquired all-aspect omniscience and manifested such a body after training in this very perfection of wisdom. 
Kauśika, it is not because of acquiring their physical body that the tathāgatas come to be counted as tathāgatas; it is because of acquiring all-aspect omniscience that the tathāgatas come to be counted as tathāgatas, and all-aspect omniscience, Kauśika, has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
“Thus, Kauśika, this body is the basis of the transcendent knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one. 
Depending on that basis, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have acquired all-aspect omniscience. 
So, this body serves as the basis of the transcendent knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one and therefore becomes a caitya for all beings to pay homage to, serve, respect, honor, and worship. 
Even after I have passed into nirvāṇa, Kauśika, the worship of my bodily relics will be just the worship of my physical body; it will not be the utter worship of the Dharma. 
“Kauśika, any son or daughter of a good family who committed this perfection of wisdom to writing, and upheld, recited, mastered, and focused their attention correctly on it, and served, respected, honored, and worshipped it with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags, would worship the transcendental knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one. 
“So it is, Kauśika, that any faithful son or daughter of a good family who wants to worship the tathāgatas should commit this very perfection of wisdom to writing and uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on it, and should serve, respect, honor, and worship it with many flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags. 
“Kauśika, just the one who has committed this perfection of wisdom to writing; upheld, recited, mastered, and focused attention correctly on it; and served, respected, honored, and worshiped it with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags would increase their stock of merit more than the one who has placed the bodily relics of a tathāgata who has passed into nirvāṇa within a caitya fashioned of the seven precious materials, or within a container fashioned of the seven precious materials, and served, respected, honored, and worshiped them with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the five perfections have also originated from it; the emptiness of internal phenomena has also originated from it, the emptiness of external phenomena has also originated from it, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena has also originated from it, the emptiness of emptiness has also originated from it, the emptiness of great extent has also originated from it, the emptiness of ultimate reality has also originated from it, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena has also originated from it, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena has also originated from it, the emptiness of the unlimited has also originated from it, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end has also originated from it, the emptiness of nonexclusion has also originated from it, the emptiness of inherent nature has also originated from it, the emptiness of all phenomena has also originated from it, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics has also originated from it, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended has also originated from it, the emptiness of nonentities has also originated from it, the emptiness of essential nature has also originated from it, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities has also originated from it;

Śakra then asked, “Blessed Lord, do those human beings of Jambudvīpa who do not honor, do not venerate, do not respect, and do not worship this perfection of wisdom not know that the worship of the perfection of wisdom is more powerful?” 
“Kauśika,” said the Blessed One, “among those human beings of Jambudvīpa, how many do you think have unbroken devotion to the Buddha, have unbroken devotion to the Dharma, and have unbroken devotion to the Saṅgha; are without hesitation concerning the Buddha, are without hesitation concerning the Dharma, and are without hesitation concerning the Saṅgha; and are utterly convinced about the Buddha, are utterly convinced about the Dharma, and are utterly convinced about the Saṅgha?” 
Śakra answered, “Blessed Lord, there are few human beings of Jambudvīpa who have unbroken devotion to the Buddha, have unbroken devotion to the Dharma, and have unbroken devotion to the Saṅgha; are without hesitation concerning the Buddha, are without hesitation concerning the Dharma, and are without hesitation concerning the Saṅgha; and are utterly convinced about the Buddha, are utterly convinced about the Dharma, and are utterly convinced about the Saṅgha.” 
The Blessed One then asked, “Kauśika, how many human beings of Jambudvīpa do you think are the sort that have attained the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment? 
How many human beings of Jambudvīpa are the sort that have attained the three gateways to liberation?

How many human beings of Jambudvīpa are the sort that have actually set out for individual enlightenment?

“Blessed Lord,” replied Śakra, “there are few human beings of Jambudvīpa of the sort that have attained the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment. 
There are even fewer of the sort that have attained the three gateways to liberation than them.

“Kauśika, it is so, it is so!” 
said the Blessed One. 
“Among the human beings of Jambudvīpa, there are few of the sort that have unbroken devotion to the Buddha, unbroken devotion to the Dharma, and unbroken devotion to the Saṅgha, and that are without hesitation concerning the Buddha, without hesitation concerning the Dharma, and without hesitation concerning the Saṅgha.

“If you ask why, it is because formerly when they roamed through cycles of existence, they did not see the Buddha, they did not listen to the Dharma, they did not venerate the Saṅgha; they did not undertake acts of generosity, did not maintain ethical discipline, did not cultivate tolerance, did not undertake perseverance, did not cultivate meditative concentration, and did not cultivate wisdom; and they did not hear of and did not cultivate the perfection of generosity, did not hear of and did not cultivate the perfection of ethical discipline, did not hear of and did not cultivate the perfection of tolerance, did not hear of and did not cultivate the perfection of perseverance, did not hear of and did not cultivate the perfection of meditative concentration, and did not hear of and did not cultivate the perfection of wisdom.

And they did not hear of and did not cultivate knowledge of all the dharmas, did not hear of and did not cultivate the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and did not hear of and did not cultivate all-aspect omniscience. 
“Therefore, Kauśika, there are few human beings of Jambudvīpa of the sort that have unbroken devotion to the Buddha, have unbroken devotion to the Dharma, and have unbroken devotion to the Saṅgha.

“Kauśika, leave aside human beings. 
How many living creatures of Jambudvīpa do you think are of the sort that have attained the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment, have attained the three gateways to liberation, have attained the eight liberations, have attained the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, have attained the four kinds of exact knowledge, or have attained the six extrasensory powers?

How many living creatures of Jambudvīpa have respect for their mother, respect for their father, respect for a virtuous ascetic, respect for those born as priests, undertake acts of service on behalf of senior family members, undertake acts of generosity, protect ethical discipline, maintain the restoration and purification ceremony, dwell with the perception of sense pleasures as a basic transgression, and, similarly, with the perception of impermanence, the perception of nonself, the perception of uncleanliness, and the perception that there is nothing delightful in the entire world? 
How many living creatures of Jambudvīpa have actually set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?” 
“Blessed Lord,” replied Śakra, “there are indeed extremely few living creatures of Jambudvīpa of the sort that have attained the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment, have attained the three gateways to liberation, have attained the eight liberations, have attained the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, have attained the four kinds of exact knowledge, have attained the six extrasensory powers, have entered the stream in order to abandon the three fetters, have become once-returners in order to attenuate desire, hatred, and delusion, have become non-returners in order to abandon the five fetters associated with the inferior, have become arhats in order to abandon the five fetters associated with the higher, or have actually set out for individual enlightenment.

and if, from as many beings as there are in the world systems of the direction below, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, each among them were to have made stūpas of the seven precious materials, about one yojana in height and half a yojana in width, in order to worship a tathāgata who had passed into nirvāṇa, and to have served, respected, honored, and worshiped them for an eon or for longer than an eon with divine flowers, divine garlands, divine perfumes, divine unguents, divine powders, divine outer robes, divine inner robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, divine flags, and various divine musical instruments;

“It would, Kauśika,” said the Blessed One. 
Śakra then said, “Still, Blessed Lord, if any son or daughter of a good family were to have written out, taken up, upheld, recited, mastered, and focused their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and served, respected, honored, and worshiped it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, it would increase the merit even more. 
If you were to ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because all virtuous phenomena are included within this perfection of wisdom. 
That is to say, the path of the ten virtuous actions, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, and the four formless absorptions; the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; the three emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the noble ones’ four truths of suffering, cause, cessation, and path, the six extrasensory powers, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, all the meditative stabilities, all the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; and knowledge of all the dharmas, the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and all-aspect omniscience are included within it. 
“This is the teaching of the lord buddhas, and having trained in it, all the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and lord buddhas of the past, future, and present have gone beyond, are going beyond, and will go beyond all phenomena. 
This completes the eighteenth chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.” 
Chapter 19 Then the Blessed One said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, it is so, it is so! 
The merit of those sons or daughters of good families will increase greatly. 
The increase in the merit of those sons or daughters of good families who commit this perfection of wisdom to writing, make it into a book, take it up, uphold it, recite it, master it, and focus their attention correctly on it, and in addition serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, is, because of that, immeasurable, incalculable, inconceivable, incomparable, and inestimable. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the all-aspect omniscience of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas has originated from the perfection of wisdom; the perfection of meditative concentration has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the perfection of perseverance has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the perfection of tolerance has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the perfection of ethical discipline has originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the perfection of generosity has originated from the perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of external phenomena has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of emptiness has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of great extent has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of ultimate reality has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of the unlimited has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of nonexclusion has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of inherent nature has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of all phenomena has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of nonentities has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness of essential nature has originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities has originated from the perfection of wisdom; the applications of mindfulness have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the correct exertions have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the supports for miraculous ability have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the faculties have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the powers have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the branches of enlightenment have originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the noble eightfold path has originated from the perfection of wisdom; the truths of the noble ones have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the meditative concentrations have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the immeasurable attitudes have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the formless absorptions have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the liberations have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the serial steps of meditative absorption have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the extrasensory powers have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the meditative stabilities have originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the dhāraṇī gateways have originated from the perfection of wisdom; the powers of the tathāgatas have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the fearlessnesses have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the kinds of exact knowledge have originated from the perfection of wisdom, great loving kindness has originated from the perfection of wisdom, great compassion has originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas have originated from the perfection of wisdom; and the five eyes of the tathāgatas have originated from the perfection of wisdom, the maturation of beings has originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the refinement of a buddhafield has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
Kauśika, knowledge of all the dharmas has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the knowledge of the aspects of the path has originated from the perfection of wisdom, and all-aspect omniscience has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
Kauśika, the vehicle of the śrāvakas has originated from the perfection of wisdom, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas has originated from the perfection of wisdom, and the Great Vehicle has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
Kauśika, unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
“Kauśika, so it is that the merit accrued earlier would come nowhere near even a hundredth part of the merit accrued if sons or daughters of good families commit this perfection of wisdom to writing, make it into a book, take it up, uphold it, recite it, master it, and focus their attention correctly on it, and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments. 
It would come nowhere near even a thousandth part, a hundred thousandth part, a ten millionth part, a hundred ten millionth part, a thousand ten millionth part, or a hundred thousand ten millionth part—or any other number, fraction, calculation, or example. 
It would come nowhere near to any comparison. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because for as long as this perfection of wisdom remains in Jambudvīpa, the precious jewel of the Buddha will not disappear, the precious jewel of the Dharma will not disappear, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will not disappear. 
For that long the path of the ten virtuous actions will appear in the world, the four meditative concentrations will appear in the world, the four immeasurable attitudes will appear in the world, the four formless absorptions will appear in the world, and the five extrasensory powers will appear in the world; the perfection of generosity will appear in the world, the perfection of ethical discipline will appear in the world, the perfection of tolerance will appear in the world, the perfection of perseverance will appear in the world, the perfection of meditative concentration will appear in the world, and the perfection of wisdom will appear in the world; the emptiness of internal phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of external phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of emptiness will appear in the world, the emptiness of great extent will appear in the world, the emptiness of ultimate reality will appear in the world, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of the unlimited will appear in the world, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end will appear in the world, the emptiness of nonexclusion will appear in the world, the emptiness of inherent nature will appear in the world, the emptiness of all phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics will appear in the world, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended will appear in the world, the emptiness of nonentities will appear in the world, the emptiness of essential nature will appear in the world, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities will appear in the world; the applications of mindfulness will appear in the world, the correct exertions will appear in the world, the supports for miraculous ability will appear in the world, the faculties will appear in the world, the powers will appear in the world, the branches of enlightenment will appear in the world, and the noble eightfold path will appear in the world; the truths of the noble ones will appear in the world, the meditative concentrations will appear in the world, the immeasurable attitudes will appear in the world, the formless absorptions will appear in the world, the liberations will appear in the world, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption will appear in the world, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation will appear in the world, the extrasensory powers will appear in the world, the meditative stabilities will appear in the world, the dhāraṇī gateways will appear in the world, the powers of the tathāgatas will appear in the world, the fearlessnesses will appear in the world, the kinds of exact knowledge will appear in the world, great loving kindness will appear in the world, great compassion will appear in the world, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas will appear in the world; and knowledge of all the dharmas will appear in the world, the knowledge of the aspects of the path will appear in the world, and all-aspect omniscience will appear in the world. 
For that long great and lofty royal families will appear in the world, great and lofty priestly families will appear in the world, and great and lofty householder families will appear in the world; the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Yāma realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Tuṣita realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm will appear in the world, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm will appear in the world; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm will appear in the world, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm will appear in the world; the gods of the Ābha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Parīttābha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm will appear in the world, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm will appear in the world; the gods of the Śubha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm will appear in the world, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm will appear in the world; the gods of the Vṛha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm will appear in the world, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm will appear in the world; the gods of the Avṛha realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Atapa realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm will appear in the world, the gods of the Sudarśana realm will appear in the world, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm will appear in the world; and those who have entered the stream will appear in the world, once-returners will appear in the world, non-returners will appear in the world, arhats will appear in the world, pratyekabuddhas will appear in the world, perfectly complete buddhas will appear in the world, and bodhisattva great beings will appear in the world. 
The transcendental knowledge of the unsurpassed buddhas happens, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma happens, the maturation of beings happens, and the refinement of a buddhafield happens.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm; the gods of the Ābha realm, the gods of the Parīttābha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm; the gods of the Śubha realm, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm; the gods of the Vṛha realm, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm; the gods of the Avṛha realm, the gods of the Atapa realm, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, the gods of the Sudarśana realm, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm, as many as there were in this great billionfold world system, “Friends, you should take up this perfection of wisdom. 
Friends, you should uphold this perfection of wisdom. 
Friends, you should recite this perfection of wisdom. 
Friends, you should master this perfection of wisdom. 
Friends, you should focus your attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. 
“Friends, through taking up, upholding, reciting, mastering, and focusing attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, the continuum of the way of the Buddha will not be cut, the continuum of the way of the Dharma will not be cut, and the continuum of the way of the Saṅgha will not be cut. 
Friends, when the continuum of the way of the Buddha is not cut, the continuum of the way of the Dharma is not cut, and the continuum of the way of the Saṅgha is not cut, the perfection of generosity will appear in the world, the perfection of ethical discipline will appear in the world, the perfection of tolerance will appear in the world, the perfection of perseverance will appear in the world, the perfection of meditative concentration will appear in the world, and the perfection of wisdom will appear in the world; the emptiness of internal phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of external phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of emptiness will appear in the world, the emptiness of great extent will appear in the world, the emptiness of ultimate reality will appear in the world, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of the unlimited will appear in the world, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end will appear in the world, the emptiness of nonexclusion will appear in the world, the emptiness of inherent nature will appear in the world, the emptiness of all phenomena will appear in the world, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics will appear in the world, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended will appear in the world, the emptiness of nonentities will appear in the world, the emptiness of essential nature will appear in the world, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities will appear in the world; the applications of mindfulness will appear in the world, the correct exertions will appear in the world, the supports for miraculous ability will appear in the world, the faculties will appear in the world, the powers will appear in the world, the branches of enlightenment will appear in the world, and the noble eightfold path will appear in the world; the truths of the noble ones will appear in the world, the meditative concentrations will appear in the world, the immeasurable attitudes will appear in the world, the formless absorptions will appear in the world, the liberations will appear in the world, the serial steps of meditative absorption will appear in the world, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation will appear in the world, the extrasensory powers will appear in the world, the meditative stabilities will appear in the world, the dhāraṇī gateways will appear in the world, the powers of the tathāgatas will appear in the world, the fearlessnesses will appear in the world, the kinds of exact knowledge will appear in the world, great loving kindness will appear in the world, great compassion will appear in the world, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas will appear in the world; and the conduct of the bodhisattvas will appear in the world, the fruit of having entered the stream will appear in the world, the fruit of once-returner will appear in the world, the fruit of non-returner will appear in the world, arhatship will appear in the world, individual enlightenment will appear in the world, and unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment will appear in the world.” 
Then the Blessed One said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, take up this perfection of wisdom, uphold it, recite it, and master it. 
Kauśika, focus your attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because when it occurs, as it habitually does, to the asuras to think, ‘We will fight the gods of the Trayastriṃśa. 
We will drive the gods of the Trayastriṃśa away from the border,’ at that time you must contemplate this perfection of wisdom in your mind, and you must chant it by heart. 
You must focus your attention correctly on it and afterward, on account of that, those habitual thoughts of the asuras will fade and the arising of those minds will not recur or flourish. 
“You, Kauśika, should chant by heart this perfection of wisdom even in the presence of those gods and goddesses who, at the time of death, see themselves being reborn in the lower realms. 
They will then be reborn in this same god realm owing to the root of the virtuous action of hearing the perfection of wisdom and owing to their belief in the perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because such is the advantage of hearing this perfection of wisdom. 
All those sons and daughters of good families, whoever they are, who hear this perfection of wisdom will, through that root of virtue, finally fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because however many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past there were, along with their communities of śrāvakas, they all attained final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no aggregates are left behind, having trained in this perfection of wisdom; however many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the future there will be, along with their communities of śrāvakas, they will all fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, having trained in this perfection of wisdom; and however many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas at present there are residing and maintaining themselves in the world systems of the ten directions, along with their communities of śrāvakas, they all fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, having trained in this perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because all the attributes on the side of enlightenment are gathered within the perfection of wisdom, whether they are the attributes of the śrāvakas, the attributes of the pratyekabuddhas, the attributes of the bodhisattvas, or the attributes of the buddhas.” 
Śakra then said, “Blessed Lord, this, the perfection of wisdom, is the great knowledge incantation. 
Blessed Lord, this, the perfection of wisdom, is the unsurpassed knowledge incantation. 
Blessed Lord, this, the perfection of wisdom, is the knowledge incantation equal to the unequaled. 
If you ask why, it is because, Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is the eliminator of all nonvirtuous phenomena and the establisher of all virtuous phenomena.” 
“Kauśika, it is so, it is so!” 
said the Blessed One. 
“Kauśika, it is because this perfection of wisdom is the great knowledge incantation. 
Kauśika, this, the perfection of wisdom, is the unsurpassed knowledge incantation. 
Kauśika, this, the perfection of wisdom, is the knowledge incantation equal to the unequaled. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because however many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past there were, they fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment relying on this same knowledge incantation; however many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the future there will be, they will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment relying on this same knowledge incantation; and however many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the present there are residing and maintaining themselves in the world systems of the ten directions, they are fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment relying on this same knowledge incantation. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because when this knowledge incantation exists, the path of the ten virtuous actions exists in the world, the four meditative concentrations exist in the world, the four immeasurable attitudes exist in the world, the formless absorptions exist in the world, and the five extrasensory powers exist in the world; the perfection of generosity exists in the world, the perfection of ethical discipline exists in the world, the perfection of tolerance exists in the world, the perfection of perseverance exists in the world, the perfection of meditative concentration exists in the world, and the perfection of wisdom exists in the world; the emptiness of internal phenomena exists in the world, the emptiness of external phenomena exists in the world, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena exists in the world, the emptiness of emptiness exists in the world, the emptiness of great extent exists in the world, the emptiness of ultimate reality exists in the world, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena exists in the world, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena exists in the world, the emptiness of the unlimited exists in the world, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end exists in the world, the emptiness of nonexclusion exists in the world, the emptiness of inherent nature exists in the world, the emptiness of all phenomena exists in the world, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics exists in the world, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended exists in the world, the emptiness of nonentities exists in the world, the emptiness of essential nature exists in the world, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities exists in the world; the applications of mindfulness exist in the world, the correct exertions exist in the world, the supports for miraculous ability exist in the world, the faculties exist in the world, the powers exist in the world, the branches of enlightenment exist in the world, and the noble eightfold path exists in the world; the truths of the noble ones exist in the world, the liberations exist in the world, the serial steps of meditative absorption exist in the world, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation exist in the world, the extrasensory powers exist in the world, the meditative stabilities exist in the world, the dhāraṇī gateways exist in the world, the powers of the tathāgatas exist in the world, the fearlessnesses exist in the world, the kinds of exact knowledge exist in the world, great loving kindness exists in the world, great compassion exists in the world, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas exist in the world; the realm of phenomena exists in the world, the very limit of reality exists in the world, the real nature exists in the world, the unmistaken real nature exists in the world, the one and only real nature exists in the world, the reality of phenomena exists in the world, the abiding nature of reality exists in the world, the maturity of phenomena exists in the world, the five eyes exist in the world, the fruit of having entered the stream exists in the world, the fruit of once-returner exists in the world, the fruit of non-returner exists in the world, arhatship exists in the world, and individual enlightenment exists in the world; and knowledge of all the dharmas exists in the world, the knowledge of the aspects of the path exists in the world, and all-aspect omniscience exists in the world. 
“Kauśika, when bodhisattvas exist, the path of the ten virtuous actions exists as a designation in the world, the four meditative concentrations exist as designations in the world, the four immeasurable attitudes exist as designations in the world, the four formless absorptions exist as designations in the world, and the five extrasensory powers exist as designations in the world; the perfection of generosity exists as a designation in the world, the perfection of ethical discipline exists as a designation in the world, the perfection of tolerance exists as a designation in the world, the perfection of perseverance exists as a designation in the world, the perfection of meditative concentration exists as a designation in the world, and the perfection of wisdom exists as a designation in the world; the emptiness of internal phenomena exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of external phenomena exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of emptiness exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of great extent exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of ultimate reality exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of the unlimited exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of nonexclusion exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of inherent nature exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of all phenomena exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of nonentities exists as a designation in the world, the emptiness of essential nature exists as a designation in the world, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities exists as a designation in the world; the applications of mindfulness exist as designations in the world, the correct exertions exist as designations in the world, the supports for miraculous ability exist as designations in the world, the faculties exist as designations in the world, the powers exist as designations in the world, the branches of enlightenment exist as designations in the world, and the noble eightfold path exists as a designation in the world; the truths of the noble ones exist as designations in the world, the liberations exist as designations in the world, the serial steps of meditative absorption exist as designations in the world, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation exist as designations in the world, the extrasensory powers exist as designations in the world, the meditative stabilities exist as designations in the world, the dhāraṇī gateways exist as designations in the world, the powers of the tathāgatas exist as designations in the world, the fearlessnesses exist as designations in the world, the kinds of exact knowledge exist as designations in the world, great compassion exists as a designation in the world, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas exist as designations in the world; knowledge of all the dharmas exists as a designation in the world, the knowledge of the aspects of the path exists as a designation in the world, and all-aspect omniscience exists as a designation in the world; those who have entered the stream exist as a designation in the world, once-returners exist as a designation in the world, non-returners exist as a designation in the world, arhatship exists as a designation in the world, individual enlightenment exists as a designation in the world, and tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas exist as a designation in the world. 
“Kauśika, just as when the orb of the moon exists, all the medicinal plants, the constellations, and the stars exist as designations in the world, in the same way, Kauśika, when the orb of the moon-like bodhisattva exists, all the medicinal plants of virtuous conduct, perfect conduct, the path of the ten virtuous actions, the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes, the formless absorptions, the extrasensory powers, the perfections, the virtuous attributes on the side of enlightenment, emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, the truths of the noble ones, the liberations, the serial steps of meditative absorption, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers, the fearlessnesses, the kinds of exact knowledge, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas exist as designations. 
All the constellations and stars that are the trainees, those with no more training, the śrāvakas, and the pratyekabuddhas exist as designations, and the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas also exist as a designation in the world. 
It is the bodhisattva great beings who reveal the mundane and supramundane doctrines to beings even at the times when the lord buddhas do not appear in the world. 
“If you ask why, it is because the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, and the Great Vehicle have originated from bodhisattvas, and that skillful means with which those bodhisattva great beings are endowed, on account of which they practice the perfection of generosity, practice the perfection of ethical discipline, practice the perfection of tolerance, practice the perfection of perseverance, practice the perfection of meditative concentration, and practice the perfection of wisdom; practice the emptiness of internal phenomena, practice the emptiness of external phenomena, practice the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, practice the emptiness of emptiness, practice the emptiness of great extent, practice the emptiness of ultimate reality, practice the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, practice the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, practice the emptiness of the unlimited, practice the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, practice the emptiness of nonexclusion, practice the emptiness of inherent nature, practice the emptiness of all phenomena, practice the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, practice the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, practice the emptiness of nonentities, practice the emptiness of essential nature, and practice the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; practice the applications of mindfulness, practice the correct exertions, practice the supports for miraculous ability, practice the faculties, practice the powers, practice the branches of enlightenment, and practice the noble eightfold path; practice the truths of the noble ones, practice the eight liberations, practice the serial steps of meditative absorption, practice the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, practice the extrasensory powers, practice the meditative stabilities, practice the dhāraṇī gateways, practice the powers of the tathāgatas, practice the fearlessnesses, practice the kinds of exact knowledge, practice great compassion, and practice the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; do not fall to the level of the śrāvakas and do not actualize the level of the pratyekabuddhas; bring beings to maturation and refine a buddhafield; and embrace the perfect life, embrace being the perfect being, embrace having the perfect buddhafield, embrace being the perfect bodhisattva, and subsequently attain all-aspect omniscience––one should know that that skillful means, too, has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom will also be endowed with these good qualities of the present life and these good qualities of other lives.” 
Śakra then asked, “Blessed Lord, what are the good qualities of the present life with which those sons or daughters of good families will be endowed, who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom?” 
“Kauśika,” said the Blessed One, “those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom will not, unless it is the maturation of a past action, die from poisoning, will not die from weapons, will not die in fire, will not die in water, up to will not die from the one hundred and one diseases. 
In place of the afflictions that royalty and ministers might subject them to, if sons or daughters of good families go to the royal palace while chanting this perfection of wisdom by heart, those seeking an opportunity to inflict harm on them will find no opportunity to inflict harm. 
The princes and the king’s chief ministers will consider it is worth asking them to speak and worth conversing with them and will think they are worth pleasing. 
If you ask why, it is because they think that way on account of the brilliance and power of this very perfection of wisdom. 
If sons or daughters of good families go to the royal palace while chanting this perfection of wisdom by heart, those princes and the king’s chief ministers will think they should use pleasing words when asking them to speak and when conversing with them, and will think they should welcome them with pleasure. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because those sons or daughters of good families have been attentive to the mind that feels loving kindness, the mind that feels compassion, the mind that feels empathetic joy, and the mind that has an equanimity toward all beings. 
Kauśika, these are the good qualities of the present life with which those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom will be endowed. 
“Kauśika, if you ask what are the good qualities of other lives with which they will be endowed, they are these: they will never be separated from the path of the ten virtuous actions, and they will never be separated from the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the six perfections, the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, or the truths of the noble ones, the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes, the formless absorptions, the liberations, the serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the powers of the tathāgatas, the fearlessnesses, the kinds of exact knowledge, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
“Except when governed by the aspiration to bring beings to maturity, they will never be born in the hells, never be born in the animal realm, and never be born in the world of Yama. 
They will never have defective limbs, never be born in an impoverished family, and never be born in a family of reed-workers, or in a family of pulkasas, blacksmiths, sweepers, butchers, pig slaughterers, or outcastes. 
They will always and without interruption be endowed with the thirty-two major marks of a great person. 
They will be reborn miraculously in those world systems where the lord buddhas are residing and maintaining themselves, which is to say, they will never be separated from the extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvas. 
They will proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield at will to see the lord buddhas, pay homage to them, venerate them, and listen to the Dharma, which is to say, they will proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield, bringing beings to maturity and refining a buddhafield as well. 
“Kauśika, so it is that those sons or daughters of good families who want these good qualities to be perfected should take up, should uphold, should recite, should master, and should focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom and not be separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience. 
Until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, they will be endowed with the good qualities of this life and those good qualities of other lives.” 
This completes the nineteenth chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.” 
Chapter 20 Then a hundred or so rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants intent on looking for an opportunity to inflict harm approached the place where the Blessed One was. 
Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, had the thought, ‘These rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants intent on looking for an opportunity to inflict harm have approached the place where the Blessed One is. 
So that when the perfection of wisdom is being preached, those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants do not, having approached the Blessed One, create obstacles, I should by all means chant by heart as much of this perfection of wisdom as I have taken up from the Blessed One.’ 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, chanted by heart as much of the perfection of wisdom as he had taken up from the Blessed One. 
Thereupon, those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants circumambulated the Blessed One from afar, in a clockwise direction, and then went back on the same path and through the same door. 
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra thought, “What is the reason those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants circumambulated the Blessed One from afar, in a clockwise direction, and then went back on the same path and through the same door?” 
The Blessed One, knowing in his mind the thought occurring to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, said to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Śāradvatīputra, this is Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, focusing his thoughts, as he habitually does, on the perfection of wisdom. 
For that reason those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants, having circumambulated me from afar, in a clockwise direction, have gone back on that same path and through that same door. 
Śāradvatīputra, among those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants I do not see any with a bright mind. 
All those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants have malicious thoughts and are only intent on looking for an opportunity to inflict harm, even though they think only this assembly is the one they should come into. 
Śāradvatīputra, I do not see among the beings of this world, with its gods, demons, Brahmā deities, virtuous ascetics, and brahmin priests, any, while this perfection of wisdom is being taught, who would approach with thoughts of hatred, intent on looking for an opportunity to harm. 
It is impossible. 
“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because this perfection of wisdom is taken care of by the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm; the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the Yāma realm, the Tuṣita realm, the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; and the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the Brahmapurohita realm, the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, the Mahābrahmā realm, the Ābha realm, the Parīttābha realm, the Apramāṇābha realm, the Ābhāsvara realm, the Śubha realm, the Parīttaśubha realm, the Apramāṇaśubha realm, the Śubhakṛtsna realm, the Vṛha realm, the Parīttavṛha realm, the Apramāṇavṛha realm, the Vṛhatphala realm, the Avṛha realm, the Atapa realm, the Sudṛśa realm, the Sudarśana realm, and the Akaniṣṭha realm in this great billionfold world system—all of them, as many as there are—and by as many śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas as there are, and by as many bodhisattvas as there are. 
If you ask why, it is because absolutely all of them have originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, this perfection of wisdom is taken care of by however many lord buddhas there are, along with their communities of śrāvakas, and however many pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattva great beings, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas there are, all of them, in the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā.

Then evil Māra had the thought, “It is certain that from among these four assemblies of the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha that are present here, and these gods living in the desire realm and these gods living in the form realm that are also present, that there are bodhisattva great beings who will be prophesied to attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, so I should go to where the Blessed One is and create an obstacle.” 
Evil Māra, wishing to go to where the Blessed One was, then conjured up a massive army with four cohorts. 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, had the thought, “Oh! 
This evil Māra has conjured up a massive army with four cohorts with the wish to go to where the Blessed One is. 
However, this array of evil Māra’s massive army with four cohorts cannot be compared with the array of King Bimbisāra’s army with four cohorts, it cannot be compared with the arrays of the massive armies with four cohorts of King Prasenajit, the Śākyas, or the Licchavis. 
This evil Māra has for a long time been looking for an opportunity to inflict harm on the Blessed One, seeking for an opportunity to inflict harm with the intention of hurting beings who are engaging correctly, so I should focus on this perfection of wisdom as is my habit and chant it by heart.” 
Thinking like that, Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, focused on this perfection of wisdom as was his habit and chanted it clearly from memory, and as Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, clearly chanted this perfection of wisdom by heart, so too, did those evil māras go back on that same path and through that same door. 
Then those gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, up to the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm, as many as there were in that assembly, conjured up many divine flowers and sets of robes that stayed in the sky, from where they sprinkled them over where the Blessed One was. 
Having showered them over where the Blessed One was, they said, “May the human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom for a long time, because, for as long as these human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha will not disappear, the Dharma will remain for a long time, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will become manifest in the world. 
For as long as these human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas in this great billionfold world system, up to the world systems of the ten directions will not disappear, the Dharma will remain for a long time, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will continue to become manifest in the world. 
The more distinguished conduct of bodhisattva great beings will also exist. 
Know that the place where the sons or daughters of good families commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and make it into a book, the place where they uphold it, is endowed with luminosity. 
Know that that place has a protector and is free from darkness.” 
Then the Blessed One said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, and to the other gods, up to those of Akaniṣṭha, “Kauśika, it is so, it is so! 
Gods, it is so, it is so! 
For as long as these human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha will not disappear, the Dharma will remain for a long time, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will become manifest in the world. 
For as long as these human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas in this great billionfold world system, up to the world systems of the ten directions will not disappear, the Dharma will remain for a long time, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will become manifest in the world. 
The more distinguished conduct of bodhisattva great beings will also exist. 
I know that the place where the sons or daughters of good families commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and make it into a book, the place where they uphold it, is endowed with luminosity. 
I know that that place has a protector and is free from darkness.” 
Then those gods, having conjured up many divine flowers and showered them over where the Blessed One was, made this statement: “Blessed Lord, Māra and the gods included within the class of māras who seek an opportunity to inflict harm will find no opportunity to inflict harm on any sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. 
Blessed Lord, we too will always guard, protect, and defend those sons or daughters of good families without interruption. 
If you ask why, it is because we consider those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom as the Teacher or as amounting to the Teacher’s equal.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom are not endowed with feeble roots of virtue. 
“Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom have fulfilled their duties under the conquerors of the past. 
Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom will have venerated many buddhas, and they will have been taken care of by spiritual mentors. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because it is through this, namely, the perfection of wisdom, that they must seek for all-aspect omniscience; because it is through this, Blessed Lord, namely, all-aspect omniscience, that they must seek for the perfection of wisdom. 
“If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because the perfection of wisdom is not one thing and all-aspect omniscience another, and all-aspect omniscience is not one thing and the perfection of wisdom another, so the perfection of wisdom and all-aspect omniscience are without duality and cannot be divided into two.” 
“Kauśika, so it is, so it is!” 
said the Blessed One. 
“Kauśika, the all-aspect omniscience of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas has originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
The perfection of wisdom has originated from all-aspect omniscience. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the perfection of wisdom is not one thing and all-aspect omniscience another, and all-aspect omniscience is not one thing and the perfection of wisdom another, so, in that case, the perfection of wisdom and all-aspect omniscience are without duality and cannot be divided into two.” 
This completes the twentieth chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.” 
Chapter 21 Then the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “In the manner the Blessed Lord proclaims the name of the perfection of wisdom he does not proclaim the name of the perfection of generosity, does not proclaim the name of the perfection of ethical discipline, does not proclaim the name of the perfection of tolerance, does not proclaim the name of the perfection of perseverance, and does not proclaim the name of the perfection of meditative concentration. 
In the manner the Blessed Lord proclaims the name of the perfection of wisdom he does not proclaim the emptiness of internal phenomena, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of external phenomena, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of emptiness, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of great extent, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of ultimate reality, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of the unlimited, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of nonexclusion, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of inherent nature, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of all phenomena, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of nonentities, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of essential nature, and does not proclaim the name of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities. 
In the manner the Blessed Lord proclaims the name of the perfection of wisdom he does not proclaim the name of the applications of mindfulness, does not proclaim the name of the correct exertions, does not proclaim the name of the supports for miraculous ability, does not proclaim the name of the faculties, does not proclaim the name of the powers, does not proclaim the name of the branches of enlightenment, and does not proclaim the name of the noble eightfold path; does not proclaim the name of the truths of the noble ones, does not proclaim the name of the meditative concentrations, does not proclaim the name of the immeasurable attitudes, does not proclaim the name of the formless absorptions, does not proclaim the name of the eight liberations, does not proclaim the name of the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, does not proclaim the name of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, does not proclaim the name of the extrasensory powers, does not proclaim the name of the meditative stabilities, and does not proclaim the name of the dhāraṇī gateways. 
In the manner the Blessed Lord proclaims the name of the perfection of wisdom he does not proclaim the name of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, does not proclaim the name of the four fearlessnesses, does not proclaim the name of the four kinds of exact knowledge, does not proclaim the name of great compassion, and does not proclaim the name of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.” 
“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “this is because this perfection of wisdom has precedence over and is the guide of the other perfections, all the emptinesses, the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment, the four truths of the noble ones, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
“Ānanda, do you think that the generosity that is not dedicated to all-aspect omniscience is the perfection of generosity? 
“No, Blessed Lord!” 
he replied. 
“Do you think that the ethical discipline that is not dedicated to all-aspect omniscience is the perfection of ethical discipline?” 
asked the Blessed One. 
“No, Blessed Lord!” 
he replied. 
“Do you think that the tolerance that is not dedicated to all-aspect omniscience is the perfection of tolerance?” 
asked the Blessed One. 
“No, Blessed Lord!” 
he replied. 
“Do you think that the perseverance that is not dedicated to all-aspect omniscience is the perfection of perseverance?” 
asked the Blessed One. 
“No, Blessed Lord!” 
he replied. 
“Do you think that the meditative concentration that is not dedicated to all-aspect omniscience is the perfection of meditative concentration?” 
asked the Blessed One. 
“No, Blessed Lord!” 
he replied. 
“Do you think that the wisdom that is not dedicated to all-aspect omniscience is the perfection of wisdom?” 
asked the Blessed One. 
“No, Blessed Lord!” 
he replied.

Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha has not yet proclaimed all the good qualities of the perfection of wisdom that I have heard from the Blessed Lord––those good qualities of sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, as many as there are, and those good qualities, as many as there are, that I, in the presence of the Blessed Lord, have taken up, upheld, recited, mastered, and propagated.

Blessed Lord, it is by having taken up, upheld, recited, and having focused attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom that the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddhas appear in the world.” 
“Kauśika,” said the Blessed One, “I do not speak exhaustively about the good qualities of those sons or daughters of good families who have taken up, upheld, recited, mastered, and focused their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because those sons or daughters of good families who will take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, will possess an immeasurable aggregate of ethical discipline; those sons or daughters of good families who will take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, will possess an immeasurable aggregate of meditative stability; those sons or daughters of good families who will take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, will possess an immeasurable aggregate of wisdom; those sons or daughters of good families who will take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, will possess an immeasurable aggregate of liberation; and those sons or daughters of good families who will take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, will possess an immeasurable aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation. 
“You should know that those sons or daughters of good families who will take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, have done the practice for the purpose of becoming a tathāgata. 
“Kauśika, with regard to the aggregate of ethical discipline, the aggregate of meditative stability, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and the aggregate of ethical discipline, the aggregate of meditative stability, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation of those sons and daughters of good families, Kauśika, the aggregate of ethical discipline, the aggregate of meditative stability, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation of all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas would come nowhere near even a hundredth part, would come nowhere near even a thousandth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred thousandth part, would come nowhere near even a ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a thousand ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred thousand ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred thousand ten million billionth part, would come nowhere near to any number, would come nowhere near to any fraction, would come nowhere near to any calculation, would come nowhere near to any example, and would not stand up to any comparison of the aggregate of ethical discipline, the aggregate of meditative stability, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation that they have. 
If you ask why, it is because the minds of those sons and daughters of good families are liberated from the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and yet nothing at all has been fully understood. 
“Kauśika, I do speak about the good qualities attained accordingly in this lifetime and in later lives by those sons or daughters of good families who write out, take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with many flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments.” 
Śakra said, “Blessed Lord, I will always will always guard, protect, and defend without interruption those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, and who commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments.” 
“Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “when sons or daughters of good families chant this perfection of wisdom by heart, many hundreds of thousands of gods will delightedly arrive to hear the Dharma, and when those sons or daughters of good families are teaching the Dharma endowed with the perfection of wisdom the gods will indeed think that they should reinforce that inspired eloquence, and also when those Dharma teachers get tired of speaking, the gods will think that they should reinforce that inspired eloquence by just that honoring of them. 
“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and who commit it to writing and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, will acquire these good qualities in this lifetime as well. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, when those sons or daughters of good families are teaching the perfection of wisdom to the four assemblies, they will not become discouraged by the thought that someone might seek to censure them and look for an opportunity to inflict harm. 
If you ask why, it is because this same perfection of wisdom will guard, protect, and defend those sons or daughters of good families. 
If you ask why, it is because in this perfection of wisdom all that is mundane and supramundane, contaminated and uncontaminated, common and uncommon, virtuous and nonvirtuous, and conditioned and unconditioned, and the attributes of the śrāvakas, the attributes of the pratyekabuddhas, the attributes of the bodhisattvas, and the attributes of the buddhas, are undifferentiated. 
“If you ask why, it is because this is the treasury of all virtuous phenomena, and since those sons or daughters of good families abide in the emptiness of internal phenomena, abide in the emptiness of external phenomena, abide in the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, abide in the emptiness of emptiness, abide in the emptiness of great extent, abide in the emptiness of ultimate reality, abide in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, abide in the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, abide in the emptiness of the unlimited, abide in the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, abide in the emptiness of nonexclusion, abide in the emptiness of inherent nature, abide in the emptiness of all phenomena, abide in the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, abide in the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, abide in the emptiness of nonentities, abide in the emptiness of essential nature, and abide in the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities, in the perfection of wisdom they neither observe censure nor do they observe one who censures, nor do they observe that which is censured. 
So, because they have been assisted by the perfection of wisdom, there is no one at all looking for an opportunity to inflict harm on those sons or daughters of good families. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom will not become disheartened and will not feel intimidated; they will not be afraid, will not be frightened, and will not become terrified. 
If you ask why, it is because those sons or daughters of good families do not observe any sort of thing that might become disheartened, feel intimidated, be afraid, be frightened, or become terrified. 
“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and who commit it to writing and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, will acquire these good qualities in his lifetime as well. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, any son or daughter of a good family who takes up, upholds, recites, masters, and focuses their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and who commits it to writing and honors, venerates, respects, and worships it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, will be greatly valued by their fathers, friends, mothers, kings, ministers, virtuous ascetics, and brahmin priests. 
They will also be greatly valued, and will be held dear, by the lord buddhas who reside in the world systems of the ten directions, as many as there are, and the bodhisattva great beings, pratyekabuddhas, arhats, non-returners, once-returners, and those who have entered the stream, as many as there are. 
They will also be greatly valued, and will be held dear, by the world with its gods, demons, and Brahmā deities, with the beings who are its virtuous ascetics and brāhmin priests, and with its gods, humans, and asuras. 
They will not be robbed of inspired eloquence, will not be robbed of the perfection of generosity, will not be robbed of the perfection of ethical discipline, will not be robbed of the perfection of tolerance, will not be robbed of the perfection of perseverance, will not be robbed of the perfection of meditative concentration, and will not be robbed of the perfection of wisdom; they will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of internal phenomena, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of external phenomena, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of emptiness, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of great extent, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of ultimate reality, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of the unlimited, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of nonexclusion, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of inherent nature, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of all phenomena, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of nonentities, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of essential nature, and will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; they will not be robbed of the cultivation of the applications of mindfulness, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the correct exertions, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the supports for miraculous ability, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the faculties, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the powers, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the branches of enlightenment, and will not be robbed of the cultivation of the noble eightfold path; they will not be robbed of the cultivation of the four truths of the noble ones, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the four meditative concentrations, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the four immeasurable attitudes, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the four formless absorptions, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the eight liberations, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the extrasensory powers, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the meditative stabilities, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the dhāraṇī gateways, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the four fearlessnesses, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the four kinds of exact knowledge, will not be robbed of the cultivation of great compassion, and will not be robbed of the cultivation of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; and they will not be robbed of the cultivation of the requirement to bring beings to maturation, will not be robbed of the cultivation of the requirement to refine a buddhafield, and will not be robbed of the cultivation of all-aspect omniscience. 
They will have the power to give a response to the arguments that have been raised by others, as many as there are, in accordance with the Dharma. 
“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom without being separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience, and who commit it to writing and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, will acquire these good qualities in his lifetime as well.

“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families should have the following thought: ‘May this generosity be a gift of the Dharma to those gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the Trayastriṃśa realm, the Yāma realm, the Tuṣita realm, the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the Brahmakāyika realm, the Brahmapurohita realm, the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the Mahābrahmā realm; the Ābha realm, the Parīttābha realm, the Apramāṇābha realm, and the Ābhāsvara realm; the Śubha realm, the Parīttaśubha realm, the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the Śubhakṛtsna realm; and the Vṛha realm, the Parīttavṛha realm, the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the Vṛhatphala realm who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, as well as the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa realms––the Avṛha realm, the Atapa realm, the Sudṛśa realm, the Sudarśana realm, and the Akaniṣṭha realm—and, other than them, to the greatly splendid gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas who have come here in order to recite, uphold, master, pay homage to, and worship this perfection of wisdom.’ 
Having recited, upheld, mastered, worshiped, paid homage to, and bowed before this perfection of wisdom, they depart. 
“Kauśika, the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the Trayastriṃśa realm, the Yāma realm, the Tuṣita realm, the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the Brahmakāyika realm, the Brahmapurohita realm, the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the Mahābrahmā realm; the Ābha realm, the Parīttābha realm, the Apramāṇābha realm, and the Ābhāsvara realm; the Śubha realm, the Parīttaśubha realm, the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the Śubhakṛtsna realm; and the Vṛha realm, the Parīttavṛha realm, the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the Vṛhatphala realm; and the Avṛha realm, the Atapa realm, the Sudṛśa realm, the Sudarśana realm, and the Akaniṣṭha realm in the great billionfold world system, and the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the Trayastriṃśa realm, the Yāma realm, the Tuṣita realm, the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the Brahmakāyika realm, the Brahmapurohita realm, the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, and the Mahābrahmā realm; the Ābha realm, the Parīttābha realm, the Apramāṇābha realm, and the Ābhāsvara realm; the Śubha realm, the Parīttaśubha realm, the Apramāṇaśubha realm, and the Śubhakṛtsna realm; and the Vṛha realm, the Parīttavṛha realm, the Apramāṇavṛha realm, and the Vṛhatphala realm; and the Avṛha realm, the Atapa realm, the Sudṛśa realm, the Sudarśana realm, and the Akaniṣṭha realm in the world systems of the ten directions, will guard, protect, and defend those sons and daughters of good families. 
Kauśika, unless there is the maturation of a past action, those looking for an opportunity to inflict harm on them will not find an opportunity to inflict harm. 
“Those sons and daughters of good families will, because of this, acquire such good qualities as these in this lifetime as well. 
“Kauśika, those gods who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment also think they should come to worship this perfection of wisdom and to guard, protect, and defend those sons and daughters of good families. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because those sons or daughters of good families have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and they remain available for the purpose of protecting all beings, bringing all beings to maturity, and for the benefit and happiness of all beings.” 
Śakra then asked, “Blessed Lord, how will those sons or daughters of good families know, ‘The gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Yāma realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Tuṣita realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm have arrived here,’ and ‘The gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm have arrived here’; ‘The gods of the Brahmakāyika realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Brahmapurohita realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm have arrived here,’ and ‘The gods of the Mahābrahmā realm have arrived here’; ‘The gods of the Ābha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Parīttābha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Apramāṇābha realm have arrived here,’ and ‘The gods of the Ābhāsvara realm have arrived here’; ‘The gods of the Śubha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Parīttaśubha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm have arrived here,’ and ‘The gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm have arrived here’; ‘The gods of the Vṛha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Parīttavṛha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm have arrived here,’ and ‘The gods of the Vṛhatphala realm have arrived here’; and ‘The gods of the Avṛha realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Atapa realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Sudṛśa realm have arrived here,’ ‘The gods of the Sudarśana realm have arrived here,’ and ‘The gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm have arrived here,’ from world systems in all the ten directions, to recite, take up, master, pay homage to, bow before, serve, respect, honor, and worship this perfection of wisdom?” 
“Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “if those sons or daughters of good families behold a great light where this perfection of wisdom has been placed, those sons or daughters of good families should know with certainty, ‘The gods with the great power of the powerful, great miraculous abilities, great authority, and great splendor have come in order to recite, uphold, master, pay homage to, bow before, serve, respect, honor, and worship this perfection of wisdom.’ ” 
“Moreover, Kauśika, if those sons or daughters of good families maintain scrupulous conduct, on account of their scrupulous conduct those gods will, having arrived and having recited, taken up, mastered, served, respected, honored, and worshiped this perfection of wisdom, become utterly overjoyed. 
The gods whose power is feeble, as many as there are in that place, will be unable to bear the splendor, glory, and majesty of the gods with the great power of the powerful, and they will think that they should depart from that place. 
The more the gods with the great power of the powerful, great miraculous abilities, great authority, and great splendor think that they should come there, the more those sons or daughters of good families will become those with great conviction. 
“In the vicinity of that place, without having deviated from conducting themselves scrupulously, in order to carry out worship of this perfection of wisdom, those sons or daughters of good families should sprinkle the ground of that area with scented water and adorn the ground of that area in many ways: scattering flowers and perfume, placing censers wafting incense, and stretching out a canopy of brocade with an attached fringe of silk tassels. 
“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families will not tire, and they will not be exhausted. 
Those sons or daughters of good families will experience ease of body, lightness of body, and radiance of body, and those sons or daughters of good families will also experience ease of mind, lightness of mind, and radiance of mind. 
“Therefore, since even when they go to bed at night, with an aspiration for this perfection of wisdom, they have a confident belief, they do not dream dreams of wickedness. 
While dreaming, in their dreams they will see the body of the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha, excellently adorned with the thirty-two major marks of a great person and embellished with the eighty minor signs, with a golden body, surrounded by the community of monks and with the bodhisattvas spread out in front, teaching the Dharma. 
They will also hear from the Tathāgata the teaching of the Dharma––of the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; of the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; of the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; and of the truths of the noble ones, the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes, the formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.

“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families will dream these types of auspicious dreams.” 
“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families will fall asleep easily and they will awaken easily. 
Their bodies will have a vitality. 
They will not have a strong attachment to the basic necessities: they will not have a strong attachment to food, they will not have a strong attachment to clothing, and they will not have a strong attachment to medications used to treat ill health. 
They will think about the basic necessities less: they will think about food less, they will think about clothing less, and will think about medications used to treat ill health less. 
To illustrate, Kauśika, it is just like the mind of a monk who practices yoga, on arising from meditative stability, saturated with attention. 
It does not have a strong attachment to food; it thinks about food less. 
Similarly, Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families will also not have a strong attachment to food and will think about food less. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because nonhumans supply the bodies they have with vitality. 
As many lord buddhas as there are, as many bodhisattvas as there are, and as many gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas as there are in the eastern direction, they all supply their bodies with vitality.

“Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families who want to acquire these good qualities right here in this lifetime should earnestly listen to, take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this very perfection of wisdom. 
They should not be separated from the mind of all-aspect omniscience. 
“Kauśika, even if those sons or daughters of good families have not taken up, have not upheld, have not recited, have not mastered, and have not focused their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, those sons or daughters of good families should commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and make it into a book, and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments. 
In that manner, Kauśika, those sons or daughters of good families will have undertaken something for the benefit of many beings and for the happiness of many beings. 
“Kauśika, if any son or daughter of a good family were to take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and, having committed it to writing, were to serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, the merit of that son of a good family or daughter of a good family would increase even more than if they did that, while it would not do so were they even, for the duration of their lives, to have served, respected, honored, and worshiped the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, along with their communities of śrāvakas residing in the world systems of all the ten directions, with many of the basic necessities: food, bedding, medications owing to ill-health, and even also, for the duration of their lives, were they to have served, respected, honored, and worshiped stūpas made of the seven precious materials with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, after those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, along with their communities of śrāvakas, had passed into nirvāṇa.” 
This completes the twenty-first chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.” 
Chapter 22 Then the Blessed One asked Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, if you could possess Jambudvīpa, filled to the brim with the relics of the tathāgatas, and if someone were to present you with this perfection of wisdom, written in the form of a book, which of these would you take?” 
“Blessed Lord,” replied Śakra, “if someone were to present me with Jambudvīpa, filled to the brim with the relics of the tathāgatas, and if someone were to present me with this perfection of wisdom, written in the form of a book, I would take just this perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is not that I do not honor those relics of the tathāgatas, it is not that I do not have confidence in them, and it is not that I do not think highly of them. 
Blessed Lord, it is not that I do not want to honor, or that I do not want to venerate, or that I do not want to respect, or that I do not want to worship the relics of the tathāgatas. 
Blessed Lord, those relics of the tathāgatas have also originated from the perfection of wisdom and that is why the relics of the tathāgatas should be honored, should be venerated, should be respected, and should be worshiped. 
Those relics have been brought into being by the perfection of wisdom. 
That is why those relics of the tathāgatas get to be worshiped. 
“Blessed Lord, when I serve, respect, honor, and worship the relics of the tathāgatas with divine flowers, divine garlands, divine perfume, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, divine flags, and various divine musical instruments, it is also because these relics of the tathāgatas have originated from the perfection of wisdom. 
It is that which this world with its gods, humans, and asuras is serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping, so that they are protected, serveed, respected, honored, and worshipped.” 
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, since this perfection of wisdom cannot be grasped, is immaterial, is impossible to indicate, is unimpeded, and has only one defining characteristic, which is to say, is without defining characteristics, how could you think a perfection of wisdom that cannot be grasped, is immaterial, is impossible to indicate, is unimpeded, and has only one defining characteristic, which is to say, is without defining characteristics, is graspable? 
If you ask why, it is because it is not something to be grasped or rejected. 
It is not to be decreased, it is not to be increased; it is not to be expanded, it is not to be abbreviated; it is not to be accumulated, it is not to be dispersed; it is not to be taken away from, it is not to be added to; and it is not for defilement, and it is not for purification. 
It is not the establisher of the attributes of the buddhas and it is not the rejecter of the attributes of ordinary persons. 
It is not the bestower of the attributes of the bodhisattvas, it is not the establisher of the attributes of the pratyekabuddhas, it is not the establisher of the attributes of the śrāvakas, it is not the establisher of the attributes of those in training or not in training, and it is not the rejecter of the attributes of ordinary persons. 
It is not the establisher of the unconditioned element and it is not the rejecter of the conditioned element. 
It is not the establisher of the perfection of generosity, it is not the establisher of the perfection of ethical discipline, it is not the establisher of the perfection of tolerance, it is not the establisher of the perfection of perseverance, it is not the establisher of the perfection of meditative concentration, and it is not the establisher of the perfection of wisdom; it is not the establisher of the emptiness of internal phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of external phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of emptiness, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of great extent, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of ultimate reality, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of the unlimited, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of nonexclusion, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of inherent nature, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of all phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of nonentities, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of essential nature, and it is not the establisher of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; it is not the establisher of the applications of mindfulness, it is not the establisher of the correct exertions, it is not the establisher of the supports for miraculous ability, it is not the establisher of the faculties, it is not the establisher of the powers, it is not the establisher of the branches of enlightenment, and it is not the establisher of the noble eightfold path; it is not the establisher of the truths of the noble ones, it is not the establisher of the meditative concentrations, it is not the establisher of the immeasurable attitudes, it is not the establisher of the formless absorptions, it is not the establisher of the liberations, it is not the establisher of the serial steps of meditative absorption, it is not the establisher of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, it is not the establisher of the extrasensory powers, it is not the establisher of the meditative stabilities, it is not the establisher of the dhāraṇī gateways, it is not the establisher of the powers of the tathāgatas, it is not the establisher of the fearlessnesses, it is not the establisher of the kinds of exact knowledge, it is not the establisher of great compassion, and it is not the establisher of the distinct qualities of the buddhas; and it is not the establisher of the fruit of having entered the stream, it is not the establisher of the fruit of once-returner, it is not the establisher of the fruit of non-returner, it is not the establisher of arhatship, it is not the establisher of individual enlightenment, it is not the establisher of the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and it is not the establisher of all-aspect omniscience.” 
“Venerable monk Śāradvatīputra, it is so, it is so!” 
replied Śakra. 
“Those who know that the perfection of wisdom is not the establisher of the attributes of the buddhas and is not the rejecter of the attributes of ordinary persons; that it is not the establisher of the attributes of the bodhisattvas, it is not the establisher of the attributes of the pratyekabuddhas, it is not the establisher of the attributes of the śrāvakas, it is not the establisher of the attributes of those in training or not in training, and it is not the rejecter of the attributes of ordinary persons; it is not the establisher of the unconditioned element and it is not the rejecter of the conditioned element; it is not the establisher of the perfection of generosity, it is not the establisher of the perfection of ethical discipline, it is not the establisher of the perfection of tolerance, it is not the establisher of the perfection of perseverance, it is not the establisher of the perfection of meditative concentration, and it is not the establisher of the perfection of wisdom; it is not the establisher of the emptiness of internal phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of external phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of emptiness, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of great extent, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of ultimate reality, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of the unlimited, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of nonexclusion, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of inherent nature, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of all phenomena, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of nonentities, it is not the establisher of the emptiness of essential nature, and it is not the establisher of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; it is not the establisher of the applications of mindfulness, it is not the establisher of the correct exertions, it is not the establisher of the supports for miraculous ability, it is not the establisher of the faculties, it is not the establisher of the powers, it is not the establisher of the branches of enlightenment, and it is not the establisher of the noble eightfold path; it is not the establisher of the truths of the noble ones, it is not the establisher of the meditative concentrations, it is not the establisher of the immeasurable attitudes, it is not the establisher of the formless absorptions, it is not the establisher of the eight liberations, it is not the establisher of the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, it is not the establisher of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, it is not the establisher of the extrasensory powers, it is not the establisher of the meditative stabilities, it is not the establisher of the dhāraṇī gateways, it is not the establisher of the powers of the tathāgatas, it is not the establisher of the fearlessnesses, it is not the establisher of the kinds of exact knowledge, it is not the establisher of great compassion, and it is not the establisher of the distinct qualities of the buddhas; and it is not the establisher of the fruit of having entered the stream, it is not the establisher of the fruit of once-returner, it is not the establisher of the fruit of non-returner, it is not the establisher of arhatship, it is not the establisher of individual enlightenment, it is not the establisher of the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and it is not the establisher of all-aspect omniscience are practitioners of the perfection of wisdom––they are cultivators of the perfection of wisdom.

Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is worthy of homage by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras. 
Having trained in it, bodhisattva great beings have attained, are attaining, and will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Blessed Lord, when I am seated on my seat, which is that of the mighty lord of the gods, in the divine assembly of Sudharmā, those gods who come to serve me, as many as there are, worship me. 
But when I do not go there and I am not seated on that seat, at that time as well those gods come to that assembly, and thinking, ‘Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, seated on this seat teaches the Dharma to the gods of Trayastriṃśa,’ circumambulate that seat from the right, pay homage to it, and then depart. 
Blessed Lord, in the same way, the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, as many as there are in the world systems of the ten directions, come to that place where this perfection of wisdom has been committed to writing, and will be upheld, chanted out loud by heart, and taught to others, and they too, thinking, ‘The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have originated from it, all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have also originated from it, and even all the everyday necessities for the happiness of all beings have originated from it,’ pay homage to and bow to the perfection of wisdom, and then go back again. 
“Also, the worship that the relics of the tathāgatas receive, it is worship they receive because they have been brought into being by the perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because when bodhisattva great beings practice the conduct of a bodhisattva, the perfection of wisdom serves as the ground of the knower of omniscience, serves as the cause, serves as the condition, and serves as the one that brings it about. 
Therefore, Blessed Lord, from those two choices, I would take just this perfection of wisdom. 
“Blessed Lord, when I, having taken up in this perfection of wisdom, chant it by heart with the mental consciousness included in phenomena, I do not observe even the mere sign of fear or panic.

“Blessed Lord, if the perfection of wisdom, which is signless, were not signless, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, having comprehended that all phenomena are signless, without an indication, inexpressible, and indescribable, and fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, would not teach beings the Dharma that is signless, without an indication, inexpressible, and indescribable. 
Blessed Lord, it is because the perfection of wisdom is signless, without an indication, inexpressible, and indescribable that the tathāgatas, having comprehended that all phenomena are signless, without an indication, inexpressible, and indescribable, and fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, teach beings the Dharma that is signless, without an indication, inexpressible, and indescribable. 
“So it is, Blessed Lord, that this perfection of wisdom is worthy of being served, respected, honored, and worshiped by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments. 
Having committed it to writing, it is worthy of being served, respected, honored, and worshiped by the world with its gods, humans, and asuras with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments. 
“Blessed Lord, someone who takes up, upholds, recites, masters, and focuses their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and, having committed it to writing, honors, venerates, respects, and worships it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, until they have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, does not need to worry about life in the hells, does not need to worry about life in the animal realm or life in the world of Yama, and does not need to worry about the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas. 
They will not be separated from seeing the tathāgatas, will not be separated from bringing beings to maturation, and will proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments. 
“Moreover, Blessed Lord, if I were presented with this great billionfold world system filled to the brim with relics of the tathāgatas, and if I were presented with this perfection of wisdom, committed to writing, Blessed Lord, from these two precious jewels I would take just this perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because the tathāgatas and the relics of the tathāgatas have originated from her, and it is for that reason that those relics of the tathāgatas are served, respected, honored, and worshiped. 
If those sons or daughters of good families serve, respect, honor, and worship them, they will not proceed into the degenerations and the terrible forms of life. 
Rather, having experienced the excellence of gods and humans, they will attain final nirvāṇa by means of the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, or the vehicle of the perfectly complete buddhas, in accordance with their aspiration. 
“Therefore, Blessed Lord, seeing the tathāgata and seeing the perfection of wisdom committed to writing are not dissimilar. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because the perfection of wisdom and the tathāgata are without duality and cannot be divided into two. 
“Moreover, Blessed Lord, a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha, abiding in the three miraculous powers and teaching and explaining the discourses, the sayings in prose and verse, the prophetic declarations, the verses, the statements made for a purpose, the introductions, the accounts, the tales of past lives, the most extensive teachings, the marvelous events, the narratives, and the established instructions, and any son or daughter of a good family taking up, comprehending, and teaching the perfection of wisdom to others––these two are also not dissimilar. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have originated from her, the three miraculous abilities have originated from her, and the discourses, the sayings in prose and verse, the prophetic declarations, the verses, the statements made for a purpose, the introductions, the accounts, the tales of past lives, the most extensive teachings, the marvelous events, the narratives, and the established instructions have originated from her. 
“Moreover, Blessed Lord, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the eastern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the southern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the western direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the northern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the intermediate northeastern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the intermediate southeastern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the intermediate southwestern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the intermediate northwestern direction; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the direction below; and the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the direction above, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, abiding in the three miraculous powers and teaching and explaining the discourses, the sayings in prose and verse, the prophetic declarations, the verses, the statements made for a purpose, the introductions, the accounts, the tales of past lives, the most extensive teachings, the marvelous events, the narratives, and the established instructions, and any son or daughter of a good family taking up, comprehending, and teaching the perfection of wisdom to others––these two are also not dissimilar. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the ten directions have originated from her, the three miraculous abilities have originated from her, and the discourses, the sayings in prose and verse, the prophetic declarations, the verses, the statements made for a purpose, the introductions, the accounts, the tales of past lives, the most extensive teachings, the marvelous events, the narratives, and the established instructions have originated from her. 
“Moreover, Blessed Lord, serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the world systems in each of the ten directions, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, and, having committed this perfection of wisdom to writing in the form of a book, serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments––these two are also not dissimilar. 
If you ask why, it is because the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have originated from her. 
“Moreover, Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and who also extensively explain it to others, do not need to worry about life in the hells, do not need to worry about life in the animal realm or life in the world of Yama, and do not need to worry about the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas. 
If you ask why, it is because those sons or daughters of good families should be known to dwell on the level of an irreversible bodhisattva. 
If you ask why, it is because they write out, take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, and serve, respect, honor, and worship what they have written out with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments. 
It is because, Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is the calmer of all fears and is the alleviator of all sicknesses. 
“Moreover, Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who commit to writing, take up, uphold, recite, and master this perfection of wisdom, and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, perfumes, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and various musical instruments, do not need to worry about danger arising anywhere. 
“Blessed Lord, to illustrate, when a person scared of a wealthy man stays with a king and relies on a king, because they stay with the king and rely on the king, whomever they fear, because they rely on him, does not frighten them. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because that is logically what happens for someone who relies on a king, which is to say, relies on a person with power. 
Similarly, Blessed Lord, those relics of the tathāgatas get to be worshiped because they have been brought into being by the perfection of wisdom. 
“Blessed Lord, the transcendental knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient should also be viewed as having been brought into being by the perfection of wisdom. 
Therefore, Blessed Lord, from those two choices, I would take just this perfection of wisdom. 
Blessed Lord, if you ask why, it is because the relics of the tathāgatas have originated from her, the thirty-two major marks of a great person have originated from her, the ten powers of the tathāgatas have originated from her, the four fearlessnesses have originated from her, the four kinds of exact knowledge have originated from her, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas have originated from her, great loving kindness has originated from her, and great compassion has originated from her. 
“Blessed Lord, the five perfections have originated from her, so they get the name perfection, up to the all-aspect omniscience of the tathāgatas has originated from her. 
“So, Blessed Lord, in villages, or towns, or cities, or regions, or kingdoms, or in the great billionfold world system where they take up, uphold, recite, and master this perfection of wisdom, and, having committed it to writing, serve, respect, honor, and worship it, the humans or nonhuman beings who are looking for an opportunity to inflict harm and seeking for an opportunity to inflict harm will not find an opportunity to inflict harm on them, and all those beings, in whichever of the three vehicles is appropriate, will eventually also become qualified for final nirvāṇa. 
“Therefore, Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom is greatly beneficial. 
She is present in the billionfold world system to benefit beings as a buddha. 
In any world system where this perfection of wisdom circulates, Blessed Lord, she should be viewed like the appearance of a buddha. 
“Blessed Lord, to illustrate, there is a most precious gemstone called priceless. 
It possesses the attributes of a most precious gemstone such as these: Wherever this gemstone is placed, nonhumans will find no opportunity to inflict harm; also a man or woman possessed by a nonhuman, when that most precious gem is shown, that nonhuman will be unable to withstand its brilliance and will swiftly depart and not dwell there. 
When that most precious gem is fastened to a body tormented by a bile disorder, the bile disorder will be purged; when that most precious gem is fastened to a body afflicted by a wind disorder, the wind disorder will be purged; when that most precious gem is fastened to a body oppressed by a phlegm disorder, the phlegm disorder will be alleviated; and when that most precious gem is fastened to a body afflicted by combined humoral disorders, the combined humoral disorders will be alleviated and will not increase. 
At night it will provide illumination. 
In the hot season, wherever that most precious gem is placed, it will provide coolness to that place; in the cold season, wherever that most precious gem is placed, it will provide warmth to that place—whatever the place on the earth where that most precious gem is placed, it will be neither too hot nor too cold, but pleasantly moderate. 
Whatever the place on the earth where that most precious gem is placed, on that place on the earth the venomous snakes and, apart from them, scorpions and so on will not move; and Blessed Lord, when that most precious gem is shown to any man or woman who had been bitten by a poisonous snake, immediately after seeing it, the poison is purged. 
“Blessed Lord, this most precious gem possesses attributes such as these: a man or woman afflicted by pustules or eyesight that has become blurred, whatever the disease that has arisen, be it eye disease, ear disease, nose disease, tongue disease, throat disease, or disease of the body, when this most precious gem is fastened to their body those pustules, or blurred vision, or eye disease, or ear disease, or nose disease, or tongue disease, or throat disease, or disease of the body are alleviated. 
“Blessed Lord, this most precious gem possesses attributes such as these: If this most precious gem were immersed in turbid water, all the water would then have the eight qualities of pure water and become the same natural color; if this most precious gem were wrapped in a blue robe and immersed in water, that water too would take on its very nature; if this most precious gem were wrapped in a yellow robe and immersed in water, that water too would take on its very nature; if this most precious gem were wrapped in a red robe and immersed in water, that water too would take on its very nature; if this most precious gem were wrapped in a purple robe and immersed in water, that water too would take on its very nature; if this most precious gem were wrapped in a crystal-colored robe and immersed in water, that water too would take on its very nature; if this most precious gem were wrapped in a robe of other various colors than them and immersed in water, that water too would take on that very nature as well; and even if the water were turbid, it would be made clear by that most precious gem. 
“Blessed Lord, this most precious gem possesses attributes such as these and many others besides, and, Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom, like that most precious divine gem, is indeed the source of all positive attributes, and is the remover of all misdeeds.” 
Then the venerable Ānanda asked Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, do you think that this most precious gem is a divine one, or does this most precious gem also exist among the human beings of Jambudvīpa?” 
“Venerable Ānanda,” replied Śakra, “this most precious gem is a divine one. 
Venerable Ānanda, those precious gems that exist among the human beings of Jambudvīpa are small and heavy, whereas the most precious divine gems are large and light. 
Those most precious gems of the human beings of Jambudvīpa are not completely perfect in all their facets, as are the divine ones. 
Indeed, those most precious gems of the human beings of Jambudvīpa come nowhere near any number, fraction, calculation, example, or comparison of the precious divine gems.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, once this most precious gem has been placed again and again in a basket, even after it has been removed from the basket. 
the basket becomes pleasing on account of the good qualities of that precious gem, and others also develop a longing for it. 
Similarly, Blessed Lord, wherever this perfection of wisdom circulates, all physical and mental suffering and affliction, whether originating from human beings or nonhuman beings, will not happen to sons or daughters of good families. 
Blessed Lord, most precious gem is an expression for the perfection of wisdom; it is an expression for the transcendental knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one.

they do not apprehend feelings conditioned by visually compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by aurally compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by nasally compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by lingually compounded sensory contact, do not apprehend feelings conditioned by corporeally compounded sensory contact, and do not apprehend feelings conditioned by mentally compounded sensory contact; they do not apprehend the earth element, do not apprehend the water element, do not apprehend the fire element, do not apprehend the wind element, do not apprehend the space element, and do not apprehend the consciousness element; they do not apprehend ignorance, do not apprehend formative predispositions, do not apprehend consciousness, do not apprehend name and form, do not apprehend the six sense fields, do not apprehend sensory contact, do not apprehend sensation, do not apprehend craving, do not apprehend grasping, do not apprehend the rebirth process, do not apprehend birth, and do not apprehend aging and death; they do not apprehend the perfection of generosity, do not apprehend the perfection of ethical discipline, do not apprehend the perfection of tolerance, do not apprehend the perfection of perseverance, do not apprehend the perfection of meditative concentration, and do not apprehend the perfection of wisdom; they do not apprehend the emptiness of internal phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of external phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of emptiness, do not apprehend the emptiness of great extent, do not apprehend the emptiness of ultimate reality, do not apprehend the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of the unlimited, do not apprehend the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, do not apprehend the emptiness of nonexclusion, do not apprehend the emptiness of inherent nature, do not apprehend the emptiness of all phenomena, do not apprehend the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, do not apprehend the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, do not apprehend the emptiness of nonentities, do not apprehend the emptiness of essential nature, and do not apprehend the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; they do not apprehend the applications of mindfulness, do not apprehend the correct exertions, do not apprehend the supports for miraculous ability, do not apprehend the faculties, do not apprehend the powers, do not apprehend the branches of enlightenment, and do not apprehend the noble eightfold path; they do not apprehend the truths of the noble ones, do not apprehend the meditative concentrations, do not apprehend the immeasurable attitudes, do not apprehend the formless absorptions, do not apprehend the eight liberations, do not apprehend the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, do not apprehend the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, do not apprehend the extrasensory powers, do not apprehend the meditative stabilities, do not apprehend the dhāraṇī gateways, do not apprehend the powers of the tathāgatas, do not apprehend the fearlessnesses, do not apprehend the kinds of exact knowledge, do not apprehend great compassion, and do not apprehend the distinct qualities of the buddhas; and they do not apprehend the fruit of having entered the stream, do not apprehend the fruit of once-returner, do not apprehend the fruit of non-returner, do not apprehend arhatship, do not apprehend individual enlightenment, do not apprehend the knowledge of the aspects of the path, do not apprehend enlightenment, do not apprehend a buddha, and do not apprehend the attributes of a buddha. 
“The perfection of wisdom is not established by way of apprehending anything. 
If you ask why, it is because an essential nature that might apprehend, that might apprehend something, and that might apprehend somewhere does not exist in her.” 
“Kauśika, it is so, it is so!” 
said the Blessed One. 
“Through practicing the perfection of wisdom for a long time without apprehending anything, those bodhisattva great beings do not apprehend even enlightenment, let alone a buddha, let alone the attributes of the buddhas.” 
Śakra then asked, “Blessed Lord, do bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom but not practice the other perfections apart from it?” 
“Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattva great beings indeed practice all six perfections, but they do so without apprehending anything. 
They do not apprehend a gift, do not apprehend a giver, and do not apprehend a recipient. 
They do not apprehend ethical discipline, do not apprehend someone who is ethically disciplined, and do not apprehend immorality. 
They do not apprehend tolerance, do not apprehend someone who is tolerant, and do not apprehend maliciousness. 
They do not apprehend perseverance, do not apprehend someone who perseveres, and do not apprehend indolence. 
They do not apprehend meditative concentration, do not apprehend someone who is in meditative concentration, and do not apprehend distraction. 
They do not apprehend wisdom, do not apprehend someone who is wise, and do not apprehend stupidity. 
“Nevertheless, Kauśika, by way of not apprehending all phenomena—by way of not apprehending physical forms, by way of not apprehending feelings, by way of not apprehending perceptions, by way of not apprehending formative predispositions, and by way of not apprehending consciousness; by way of not apprehending the eyes, by way of not apprehending the ears, by way of not apprehending the nose, by way of not apprehending the tongue, by way of not apprehending the body, and by way of not apprehending the mental faculty;

“Kauśika, to illustrate, just as the trees of Jambudvīpa have diverse foliage, diverse flowers, diverse fruits, diverse shapes, and diverse height and width, but, insofar as their shade is concerned, are without distinctions or details, similarly, Kauśika, in the case of the five perfections that are assisted by the perfection of wisdom and have been dedicated to the transcendental knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one, no distinctions or details are apprehended.” 
Śakra then said, “Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is endowed with great good qualities because it fulfills all good qualities. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is endowed with immeasurable good qualities because it is endowed with good qualities that are immeasurable. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is endowed with limitless good qualities because it is endowed with boundless good qualities. 
“Blessed Lord, any sons or daughters of good families who, having committed this perfection of wisdom to writing and made it into a book, were to uphold it and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, butter lamps, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments, and, on top of that, were to focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom as it has been explained, and were any sons or daughters of good families, having made this perfection of wisdom into a book, to bestow it upon others, which of these two would increase the merit more?” 
“So then, Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “I will ask you yourself a question and you should answer as best you can. 
Kauśika, were certain sons or daughters of good families to serve, respect, honor, and worship many relics of the tathāgatas with flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, butter lamps, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments, and were certain sons or daughters of good families to give mustard seed-size relic of the tathāgatas, were to share them so certain sons or daughters of good families, having received a mustard seed-size relic of the tathāgatas, might serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, butter lamps, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments, which of these two do you think would increase the merit more?” 
Śakra answered, “Blessed Lord, as I understand the meaning of what the Blessed Lord has said, those who bestow a mustard seed-size relic of the tathāgatas on others would increase merit more than the sons or daughters of good families who have served, respected, honored, and worshiped many relics of the tathāgatas with flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, butter lamps, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments. 
“Blessed Lord, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas, seeing that very fact, generated great compassion for the beings, among the classes of beings, who can be trained by means of the pearl relics of the tathāgata, became absorbed in the vajra-like meditative stability, destroyed their vajra-like body, and the blessed relics of the tathāgatas remained. 
Blessed Lord, if any were to worship a relic of the tathāgatas, as small as it gets, mustard-seed size, with various offerings, by the time that root of virtue reached its end they would all have made an end to suffering.” 
“Kauśika, it is so, it is so!” 
said the Blessed One. 
“Kauśika, any sons or daughters of good families who commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and then bestow it upon others out of joy in the Dharma would increase merit more than the sons or daughters of good families who, having made this perfection of wisdom into a book, have served, respected, honored, and worshiped it with flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, butter lamps, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, if any sons or daughters of good families were to approach others and explain and teach, expound and interpret, and disclose and elucidate the perfection of wisdom, just as it has been taught, those sons or daughters of good families would increase merit more than the former sons or daughters of good families. 
They would be thought of as the Teacher. 
They would be thought of as those worthy of the position of guru, as learned and like Brahmā in conduct. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because they are the Teacher of this very perfection of wisdom. 
The Teacher is not one thing and the perfection of wisdom another; rather, the very perfection of wisdom is the Teacher, and the very Teacher is the perfection of wisdom. 
If you ask why, it is because, having trained in this very perfection of wisdom, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past, future, and present have fully awakened, will fully awaken, and are fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
Those who are like Brahmā in conduct are none other than the irreversible bodhisattvas. 
They too, having trained in this same perfection of wisdom, have attained, will attain, and are fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Kauśika, those who follow the vehicle of the śrāvakas too, having trained in this very perfection of wisdom, have attained, will attain, and are attaining the fruit of having entered the stream; have attained, will attain, and are attaining the fruit of once-returner; have attained, will attain, and are attaining the fruit of non-returner; and have attained, will attain, and are attaining arhatship. 
Those who follow the vehicle of the śrāvakas too, having trained in this very perfection of wisdom, have fully awakened, will fully awaken, and are fully awakening to individual enlightenment. 
Bodhisattva great beings too, having trained in this very perfection of wisdom, have entered, will enter, and are entering a bodhisattva’s full maturity. 
They have attained, will attain, and are fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Therefore, Kauśika, the sons or daughters of good families who wish to honor, who wish to venerate, who wish to respect, and who wish to worship the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, butter lamps, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and diverse musical instruments should commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and serve, respect, honor, and worship it with flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments. 
“Kauśika, when I, seeing the force of this very fact, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, thought, ‘What should I rely on and make a practice of serving, respecting, honoring, worshiping?’ 
and when, Kauśika, in regard to that, I did not observe anyone similar or superior to me in this world with its gods, demons, and Brahmā deities, with its beings who are virtuous ascetics and brahmin priests, and with its many gods, humans, and asuras, I thought, ‘In that case, I should rely on and make a practice of serving, respecting, honoring, worshiping just that peaceful, sublime Dharma through which I myself fully awakened.’ 
“Kauśika, if you ask what that Dharma is, it is this very perfection of wisdom. 
So it is, Kauśika, that even somebody like me honors, venerates, respects, and worships this perfection of wisdom, and given that I make a practice of serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping in that manner, Kauśika, it goes without saying that those sons or daughters of good families who wish to fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment should serve, respect, honor, and worship this very perfection of wisdom with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and diverse musical instruments. 
It goes without saying that those sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the śrāvakas and those sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas should serve, respect, honor, and worship the perfection of wisdom with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and diverse musical instruments. 
If you ask why, it is because the bodhisattva great beings have originated from the perfection of wisdom; the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have originated from the bodhisattvas; and the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have originated from the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas. 
“Therefore, Kauśika, sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, or sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the śrāvakas or the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, should serve, respect, honor, and worship the perfection of wisdom with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, flags, and diverse musical instruments. 
Those sons or daughters of good families who train accordingly in her, have fully awakened, will fully awaken, and are fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment; those who follow the vehicle of the śrāvakas also have attained, will attain, and are attaining arhatship; and those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas also have attained, will attain, and are attaining individual enlightenment.” 
This completes the twenty-second chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.” 
Chapter 23: Śakra Then the Blessed One said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, if any sons or daughters of good families were to have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in the paths of the ten virtuous actions, do you think, Kauśika, that for this reason those sons or daughters of good families would have greatly increased their merit?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord! 
Greatly, Well-Gone One!” 
The Blessed One then said, “Kauśika, if any were to bestow a book of this perfection of wisdom on others so that they might recite it, write it out, or chant it by heart, they would even more greatly increase their merit than that. 
If you ask why, it is because in this perfection of wisdom it reveals extensively such attributes as those uncontaminated attributes, having trained in which sons or daughters of good families have entered, enter, and will enter into the maturity of the perfect nature have attained, attain, and will attain the fruit of having entered the stream; have attained, attain, and will attain the fruit of once-returner; have attained, attain, and will attain the fruit of non-returner; and have attained, attain, and will attain arhatship; those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas have attained, attain, and will attain individual enlightenment; and those who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment have entered, enter, and will enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas, and have fully awakened, fully awaken, and will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Kauśika, if you ask what are those uncontaminated attributes, they are the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; and the four truths of the noble ones, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the six extrasensory powers, all the meditative stabilities, all the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, great loving kindness, great compassion, great empathetic joy, and great equanimity. 
They are the uncontaminated attributes. 
They are taught extensively in the perfection of wisdom. 
Having trained in them, sons or daughters of good families have fully awakened, fully awaken, and will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Kauśika, if they have established a single being in the fruit of having entered the stream, the merit of those sons or daughters of good families would increase more greatly, but it would not from having established the beings of Jambudvīpa in the paths of the ten virtuous actions. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the beings who are established in the paths of the ten virtuous actions are not liberated from the hells, the animal realm, and the world of Yama. 
Kauśika, since the being who has been established in the fruit of having entered the stream is liberated from the hells, the animal realm, and the world of Yama, what need one say about those who are established in the fruit of once-returner, the fruit of non-returner, and arhatship. 
“Kauśika, any who have established a single being in individual enlightenment would increase their merit more greatly than any who have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in the fruit of having entered the stream, the fruit of once-returner, the fruit of non-returner, or arhatship. 
“Kauśika, any sons or daughters of good families who have established a single being in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment would increase their merit more greatly than any sons or daughters of good families who have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in the fruit of having entered the stream. 
If you ask why, it is because the single being has acted in order that the continuum of the way of the Buddha will not be cut. 
“Kauśika, any sons or daughters of good families who have established a single being in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment would increase their merit more greatly than any sons or daughters of good families who have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in the fruit of once-returner. 
If you ask why, it is because the single being has acted in order that the continuum of the way of the Buddha will not be cut. 
“Kauśika, any sons or daughters of good families who have established a single being in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment would increase their merit more greatly than any sons or daughters of good families who have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in the fruit of non-returner. 
If you ask why, it is because the single being has acted in order that the continuum of the way of the Buddha will not be cut. 
“Kauśika, any sons or daughters of good families who have established a single being in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment would increase their merit more greatly than any sons or daughters of good families who have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in arhatship. 
If you ask why, it is because the single being has acted in order that the continuum of the way of the Buddha will not be cut. 
“Kauśika, any sons or daughters of good families who have established a single being in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment would increase their merit more greatly than any sons or daughters of good families who have established the beings of Jambudvīpa in individual enlightenment. 
If you ask why, it is because the single being who is placed into unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment has acted in order that the continuum of the way of the Buddha will not be cut. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because those who have entered the stream, once-returners, non-returners, arhats, and pratyekabuddhas have originated from the bodhisattvas. 
The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have originated from the bodhisattvas. 
Therefore, Kauśika, one should know this to be the case, that the bodhisattvas should be worshiped and respected, that they should be served, respected, honored, and worshiped with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and diverse musical instruments by the world with its gods, its demons, its Brahmā deities, and its virtuous ascetics and brahmin priests. 
“Kauśika, if any sons or daughters of good families were to establish all the beings of Jambudvīpa in the paths of the ten virtuous actions, do you think, Kauśika, that for this reason those sons or daughters of good families would greatly increase their merit?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord! 
Greatly, Well-Gone One!” 
replied Śakra. 
“Kauśika,” said the Blessed One, “if any sons or daughters of good families were to bestow a book of this perfection of wisdom on others so that they might commit it to writing, or recite it, or chant it by heart, they would even more greatly increase their merit. 
If you ask why, it is because in this perfection of wisdom it reveals extensively those uncontaminated attributes, having trained in which sons or daughters of good families have entered, enter, and will enter into the maturity of the perfect nature; have attained, attain, and will attain the fruit of having entered the stream; have attained, attain, and will attain the fruit of once-returner; have attained, attain, and will attain the fruit of non-returner; and have attained, attain, and will attain arhatship; those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas have attained, attain, and will attain individual enlightenment; and those who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment have entered, enter, and will enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas, and have fully awakened, fully awaken, and will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Kauśika, if you ask what are those uncontaminated attributes, they are the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; and the four truths of the noble ones, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the six extrasensory powers, all the meditative stabilities, all the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, great loving kindness, great compassion, great empathetic joy, and great equanimity. 
It also reveals extensively other immeasurable attributes of the buddhas. 
“From this round of teaching also, Kauśika, one should know that any sons or daughters of good families who make this perfection of wisdom into a book and give it to others in order that they might recite it, write it out, and chant it by heart increase their merit more greatly. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because all the attributes are revealed extensively by this perfection of wisdom. 
It is owing to these that great and lofty royal families exist, great and lofty priestly families exist, and great and lofty householder families exist; that the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm exist, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm exist, the gods of the Yāma realm exist, the gods of the Tuṣita realm exist, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm exist, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm exist; that the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm exist, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm exist, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm exist, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm exist; that the gods of the Ābha realm exist, the gods of the Parīttābha realm exist, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm exist, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm exist; that the gods of the Śubha realm exist, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm exist, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm exist, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm exist; that the gods of the Vṛha realm exist, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm exist, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm exist, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm exist; that the gods of the Avṛha realm exist, the gods of the Atapa realm exist, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm exist, the gods of the Sudarśana realm exist, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm exist; that the gods of the sphere of infinite space exist, the gods of the sphere of infinite consciousness exist, the gods of the sphere of nothing-at-all exist, and the gods of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception exist; that the perfection of generosity exists, the perfection of ethical discipline exists, the perfection of tolerance exists, the perfection of perseverance exists, the perfection of meditative concentration exists, and the perfection of wisdom exists; that the emptiness of internal phenomena exists, the emptiness of external phenomena exists, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena exists, the emptiness of emptiness exists, the emptiness of great extent exists, the emptiness of ultimate reality exists, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena exists, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena exists, the emptiness of the unlimited exists, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end exists, the emptiness of nonexclusion exists, the emptiness of inherent nature exists, the emptiness of all phenomena exists, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics exists, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended exists, the emptiness of nonentities exists, the emptiness of essential nature exists, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities exists; that the applications of mindfulness exist, the correct exertions exist, the supports for miraculous ability exist, the faculties exist, the powers exist, the branches of enlightenment exist, and the noble eightfold path exists; that the truths of the noble ones exist, the meditative concentrations exist, the immeasurable attitudes exist, the formless absorptions exist, the eight liberations exist, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption exist, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation exist, the extrasensory powers exist, the meditative stabilities exist, the dhāraṇī gateways exist, the powers of the tathāgatas exist, the fearlessnesses exist, the kinds of exact knowledge exist, great compassion exists, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas exist; that the fruit of having entered the stream exists, the fruit of once-returner exists, the fruit of non-returner exists, arhatship exists, individual enlightenment exists, the knowledge of the aspects of the path exists, and all-aspect omniscience exists; and that those who have entered the stream exist, once-returners exist, non-returners exist, arhats exist, pratyekabuddhas exist, bodhisattva great beings exist, and the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas exist. 
“Kauśika, leaving aside the beings of Jambudvīpa, Kauśika, if any sons or daughters of good families were to establish the beings of the world system with its four continents, as many as there are, in the paths of the ten virtuous actions, do you think, Kauśika, that for this reason those sons or daughters of good families would greatly increase their merit?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord!

How do bodhisattva great beings practice when the perfection of perseverance is complete? 
How do bodhisattva great beings practice when the perfection of meditative concentration is complete? 
And how do bodhisattva great beings practice when the perfection of wisdom is complete?” 
“Kauśika,” said the Blessed One, “here, when bodhisattva great beings undertake acts of generosity, they do not apprehend the undertaking, and they do not apprehend the act of generosity or the recipient. 
When they maintain ethical discipline, they do not apprehend ethical discipline or the proper adopting of ethical discipline. 
When they cultivate tolerance, they do not apprehend tolerance or the cultivation of tolerance. 
When they undertake perseverance, they do not apprehend perseverance or the undertaking of perseverance. 
When they become absorbed in meditative concentration, they do not apprehend meditative concentration or the cultivation of meditative concentration.

“Kauśika, when bodhisattva great beings practice in that manner, the perfection of generosity is complete, the perfection of ethical discipline is complete, the perfection of tolerance is complete, the perfection of perseverance is complete, the perfection of meditative concentration is complete, and the perfection of wisdom is complete.

Given those without such a comprehension, instruction in the perfection of ethical discipline should be according to the meaning and the letter. 
And given those without such a comprehension, instruction in the perfection of generosity should be according to the meaning and the letter. 
“If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because at a time in the future there will be certain sons or daughters of good families who will give instructions in a reflection of perfection of wisdom to followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas. 
Even sons or daughters of good families who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, having heard that reflection, will destroy the path, so instruction in the perfection of wisdom should be given to them according to the meaning and the letter.” 
Śakra then asked, “Blessed Lord, what is a reflection of the perfection of wisdom?” 
“In this regard, Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “sons or daughters of good families thinking, ‘We will give instruction in the perfection of wisdom,’ give instruction in the reflection.” 
Śakra asked, “Blessed Lord, how do those sons or daughters of good families give instruction in a reflection of the perfection of wisdom?” 
“Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “in this regard, when sons or daughters of good families are giving instruction in the perfection of wisdom, they are giving instruction in a reflection of the perfection of wisdom.

Child of a good family, when you train in the perfection of wisdom, at that time you will attain the attributes of omniscience. 
When you attain the attributes of omniscience, at that time your cultivation of the perfection of wisdom will become even more complete than that. 
When your cultivation of the perfection of wisdom becomes even more complete than that, at that time you will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment,’ their merit increases even more greatly than theirs. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the irreversible level of bodhisattva great beings originates from her. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, were all the beings of Jambudvīpa, as many as there are, to have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and if any sons or daughters of good families were to describe and teach this perfection of wisdom in detail according to the meaning and the letter, and explain and interpret, analyze and elucidate, and completely disclose it to them, exhorting them, saying, ‘Come here, child of a good family.

“If you ask why, it is because those irreversible bodhisattva great beings are certain––they are fixed on perfect enlightenment and will not become irreversible from unsurpassed, complete enlightenment. 
There is no need from now on to still give additional instructions to them. 
These [later ones] want to emerge from saṃsāra and are pained by great compassion.” 
Śakra then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, the more that bodhisattva great beings approach unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, the more that those bodhisattva great beings should be advised and instructed in the perfection of generosity, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the perfection of ethical discipline, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the perfection of tolerance, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the perfection of perseverance, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the perfection of meditative concentration, and the more that they should be advised and instructed in the perfection of wisdom. 
“The more that bodhisattva great beings approach unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of internal phenomena, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of external phenomena, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of emptiness, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of great extent, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of ultimate reality, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of the unlimited, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of nonexclusion, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of inherent nature, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of all phenomena, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of nonentities, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of essential nature, and the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; the more that bodhisattva great beings should be advised and instructed in the applications of mindfulness, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the correct exertions, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the supports for miraculous ability, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the faculties, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the powers, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the branches of enlightenment, and the more that they should be advised and instructed in the noble eightfold path; and the more that they should be advised and instructed in the truths of the noble ones, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the meditative concentrations, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the immeasurable attitudes, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the formless absorptions, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the eight liberations, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the extrasensory powers, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the meditative stabilities, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the dhāraṇī gateways, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the powers of the tathāgatas, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the fearlessnesses, the more that they should be advised and instructed in the kinds of exact knowledge, the more that they should be advised and instructed in great loving kindness, the more that they should be advised and instructed in great compassion, and the more that they should be advised and instructed in the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
“They should also be assisted with the basic necessities: robes, alms, bedding, and medications used to treat ill health. 
The merit of sons or daughters of good families who assist those bodhisattva great beings, attracting them with the Dharma and attracting them with material things, increases more greatly, but of those earlier sons or daughters of good families it does not. 
If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because this happens because of that. 
Those bodhisattva great beings are advised and instructed in the perfection of generosity, are advised and instructed in the perfection of ethical discipline, are advised and instructed in the perfection of tolerance, are advised and instructed in the perfection of perseverance, are advised and instructed in the perfection of meditative concentration, and are advised and instructed in the perfection of wisdom; they are advised and instructed in the emptiness of internal phenomena, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of external phenomena, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of emptiness, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of great extent, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of ultimate reality, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of the unlimited, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of nonexclusion, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of inherent nature, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of all phenomena, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of nonentities, are advised and instructed in the emptiness of essential nature, and are advised and instructed in the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; they are advised and instructed in the applications of mindfulness, are advised and instructed in the correct exertions, are advised and instructed in the supports for miraculous ability, are advised and instructed in the faculties, are advised and instructed in the powers, are advised and instructed in the branches of enlightenment, and are advised and instructed in the noble eightfold path; and they are advised and instructed in the truths of the noble ones, are advised and instructed in the meditative concentrations, are advised and instructed in the immeasurable attitudes, are advised and instructed in the formless absorptions, are advised and instructed in the eight liberations, are advised and instructed in the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, are advised and instructed in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, are advised and instructed in the extrasensory powers, are advised and instructed in the meditative stabilities, are advised and instructed in the dhāraṇī gateways, are advised and instructed in the ten powers of the tathāgatas, are advised and instructed in the four fearlessnesses, are advised and instructed in the four kinds of exact knowledge, are advised and instructed in great loving kindness, are advised and instructed in great compassion, and are advised and instructed in the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.” 
Then the venerable Subhūti said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Excellent, excellent, Kauśika, that you thus generate resolve in bodhisattva great beings, that you benefit bodhisattva great beings, and that you protect them. 
Kauśika, you should act in that manner. 
Those noble śrāvakas who wish to benefit beings should also generate in the bodhisattva great beings a resolve toward unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
They should benefit and protect bodhisattvas by benefiting them with the Dharma and material things. 
If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the source of the saṅgha of the śrāvakas of the Blessed One is the bodhisattva great beings. 
“If bodhisattva great beings were not to set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, then bodhisattva great beings would not train in those six perfections––the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom. 
They would not train in the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, or the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; or the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, or the noble eightfold path; or the truths of the noble ones, the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes, the formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the powers of the tathāgatas, the fearlessnesses, the kinds of exact knowledge, or the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
They would not fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Were they not to fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas would also not exist. 
But, Kauśika, bodhisattva great beings do indeed train in those six perfections––the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom. 
They do indeed train in the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; in the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; and in the truths of the noble ones, the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes, the formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the powers of the tathāgatas, the fearlessnesses, the kinds of exact knowledge, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
“So, those bodhisattva great beings do fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, in all world systems the continuum of the hells is cut, the continuum of the animal realm is cut, and the continuum of the world of Yama is cut; the ranks of the asuras decline and the ranks of gods flourish; great and lofty royal families appear in the world, great and lofty priestly families appear in the world, and great and lofty householder families appear in the world; the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm appear in the world, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm appear in the world, the gods of the Yāma realm appear in the world, the gods of the Tuṣita realm appear in the world, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm appear in the world, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm appear in the world; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm appear in the world, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm appear in the world, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm appear in the world, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm appear in the world; the gods of the Ābha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Parīttābha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm appear in the world, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm appear in the world; the gods of the Śubha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm appear in the world, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm appear in the world; the gods of the Vṛha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm appear in the world, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm appear in the world; the gods of the Avṛha realm appear in the world, the gods of the Atapa realm appear in the world, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm appear in the world, the gods of the Sudarśana realm appear in the world, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm appear in the world; the gods of the sphere of infinite space appear in the world, the gods of the sphere of infinite consciousness appear in the world, the gods of the sphere of nothing-at-all appear in the world, and the gods of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception appear in the world; the perfection of generosity appears in the world, the perfection of ethical discipline appears in the world, the perfection of tolerance appears in the world, the perfection of perseverance appears in the world, the perfection of meditative concentration appears in the world, and perfection of wisdom appears in the world; the emptiness of internal phenomena appears in the world, the emptiness of external phenomena appears in the world, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena appears in the world, the emptiness of emptiness appears in the world, the emptiness of great extent appears in the world, the emptiness of ultimate reality appears in the world, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena appears in the world, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena appears in the world, the emptiness of the unlimited appears in the world, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end appears in the world, the emptiness of nonexclusion appears in the world, the emptiness of inherent nature appears in the world, the emptiness of all phenomena appears in the world, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics appears in the world, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended appears in the world, the emptiness of nonentities appears in the world, the emptiness of essential nature appears in the world, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities appears in the world; the applications of mindfulness appear in the world, the correct exertions appear in the world, the supports for miraculous ability appear in the world, the faculties appear in the world, the powers appear in the world, the branches of enlightenment appear in the world, and the noble eightfold path appears in the world; the truths of the noble ones appear in the world, the meditative concentrations appear in the world, the immeasurable attitudes appear in the world, the formless absorptions appear in the world, the eight liberations appear in the world, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption appear in the world, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation appear in the world, the meditative stabilities appear in the world, the dhāraṇī gateways appear in the world, the ten powers of the tathāgatas appear in the world, the four fearlessnesses appear in the world, the four kinds of exact knowledge appear in the world, great compassion appears in the world, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas appear in the world; and the vehicle of the śrāvakas appears in the world, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas appears in the world, and the Great Vehicle appears in the world.” 
This completes the twenty-third chapter, “Śakra,” from The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines. 
Chapter 24: Dedication Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya said to the elder Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, that which is the basis of meritorious action associated with the rejoicing of a bodhisattva great being; that which is the basis of meritorious action associated with a bodhisattva great being’s rejoicing, which is dedicated, having made common cause with all beings, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything; that which is the foundation of meritorious action associated with the rejoicing of all beings; and that which is the basis of meritorious action arisen from the generosity, and the basis of meritorious action arisen from the ethical discipline and arisen from the meditation of the followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas and the followers of the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas—from among these, just that basis of meritorious action associated with a bodhisattva great being’s rejoicing, which is dedicated, having made common cause with all beings, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment is said to be supreme, is said to be the best, is said to be the foremost, is said to be excellent, is said to be perfect, is said to be the greatest, is said to be unsurpassed, is said to be unexcelled, is said to be unequaled, and is said to be equal to the unequaled. 
“If you ask why, it is because the basis of meritorious action arisen from the generosity, and the basis of meritorious action arisen from the ethical discipline and arisen from the meditation of the followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas and the followers of the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas are simply established for their personal discipline, for their personal peace, and for their personal attainment of complete nirvāṇa. 
The applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, and the four truths of the noble ones, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the four kinds of exact knowledge, and the six extrasensory powers, are also simply established for their personal discipline, for their personal peace, and for their personal attainment of complete nirvāṇa. 
On the other hand, when it comes to the bodhisattva, the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing has been dedicated, having made common cause with all beings, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, in order that all beings might be disciplined, brought to peace, and attain final nirvāṇa.” 
Then the venerable Subhūti said to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “There are the roots of virtue, whatever they are, as many as there are, associated with the six perfections of those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the eastern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the southern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the western direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the northern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the direction below; and those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the direction above, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment, up to fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, up to when they passed into final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no aggregates are left behind, and up until the disappearance of their Dharma. 
There are the basis of meritorious action arisen from generosity, the basis of meritorious action arisen from ethical discipline, the basis of meritorious action arisen from meditation, those uncontaminated roots of virtue of those learning, and those uncontaminated roots of virtue of those not learning, who are followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas. 
And there is the aggregate of ethical discipline, the aggregate of meditative stability, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation of those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas; altruism and great compassion; the countless and immeasurable attributes of the buddhas; and those roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those who, having trained in that Dharma, attained the fruit of having entered the stream, attained the fruit of once-returner, attained the fruit of non-returner, attained arhatship, attained individual enlightenment, and entered into the maturity of the bodhisattvas. 
Bodhisattva great beings gather together all of those roots of virtue, as many as there are, generated on account of those tathāgatas, whether they are present, or whether they have passed into complete nirvāṇa; rejoice with the rejoicing that is excellent, foremost, best, supreme, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled; and, having rejoiced in that manner, having made common cause with all beings, dedicate that basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment with, ‘May it bring about unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ 
And when those who have set out in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas in that manner have dedicated in those words and with that sort of thought, are those bases and those objective referents—the bases and objective referents on account of which that sort of thought has arisen—apprehended in the way they are when they have been made into mental images by those children of good families?” 
Maitreya replied, “Just like the dedication, having made a mental image, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by those children of good families who are followers of the bodhisattvas’ Great Vehicle, similarly, those bases and those objective referents are not apprehended.” 
Subhūti then said, “If the lord buddhas are present in the world systems of the ten directions on account of such nonexistent bases and nonexistent objective referents, and if their roots of virtue, as many as there are, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment to as long as their Dharma remains; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those sons and daughters of good families who are the followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those learning; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those not learning were all to have been gathered and compressed together and to have been dedicated to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of mental images, well then, it would be like the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of the impermanent as ‘permanent’; the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of suffering as ‘happiness’; the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of nonself as ‘a self’; and the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of the impure as ‘pure.’ 
Would the perception of those not be mistaken like that? 
“Everything would also be just like the bases and just like the objective referents, so enlightenment would also be similar; the mind also similar; the perfection of generosity also similar, and the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom also similar; physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness also similar; the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mental faculty also similar; sights, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena also similar; the sensory elements, the sense fields, and the links of dependent origination also similar; the emptiness of internal phenomena also similar, the emptiness of external phenomena also similar, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena also similar, the emptiness of emptiness also similar, the emptiness of great extent also similar, the emptiness of ultimate reality also similar, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena also similar, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena also similar, the emptiness of the unlimited also similar, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end also similar, the emptiness of nonexclusion also similar, the emptiness of inherent nature also similar, the emptiness of all phenomena also similar, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics also similar, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended also similar, the emptiness of nonentities also similar, the emptiness of essential nature also similar, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities also similar; the applications of mindfulness also similar, the correct exertions also similar, the supports for miraculous ability also similar, the faculties also similar, the powers also similar, the branches of enlightenment also similar, and the noble eightfold path also similar; and the truths of the noble ones also similar, the meditative concentrations also similar, the immeasurable attitudes also similar, the formless absorptions also similar, the eight liberations also similar, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption also similar, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation also similar, the extrasensory powers also similar, the meditative stabilities also similar, the dhāraṇī gateways also similar, the ten powers of the tathāgatas also similar, the four fearlessnesses also similar, the four kinds of exact knowledge also similar, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas also similar. 
“In that case, if enlightenment is also just like the bases and just like the objective referents, and the mind also similar; the perfection of generosity also similar, and the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom also similar; physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness also similar; the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mental faculty also similar; sights, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena also similar; the sensory elements, the sense fields, and the links of dependent origination also similar; the emptiness of internal phenomena also similar, the emptiness of external phenomena also similar, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena also similar, the emptiness of emptiness also similar, the emptiness of great extent also similar, the emptiness of ultimate reality also similar, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena also similar, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena also similar, the emptiness of the unlimited also similar, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end also similar, the emptiness of nonexclusion also similar, the emptiness of inherent nature also similar, the emptiness of all phenomena also similar, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics also similar, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended also similar, the emptiness of nonentities also similar, the emptiness of essential nature also similar, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities also similar; the applications of mindfulness also similar, the correct exertions also similar, the supports for miraculous ability also similar, the faculties also similar, the powers also similar, the branches of enlightenment also similar, and the noble eightfold path also similar; and the truths of the noble ones also similar, the meditative concentrations also similar, the immeasurable attitudes also similar, the formless absorptions also similar, the eight liberations also similar, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption also similar, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation also similar, the extrasensory powers also similar, the meditative stabilities also similar, the dhāraṇī gateways also similar, the ten powers of the tathāgatas also similar, the four fearlessnesses also similar, the four kinds of exact knowledge also similar, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas also similar, then, when there is a dedication to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, what are the bases, what are the objective referents, what is the enlightenment, what is the mind, what are those roots of virtue, and what is the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing?” 
Maitreya replied, “If bodhisattva great beings practice the practice of the six perfections, wait on many buddhas, generate the roots of virtue, have been assisted by spiritual mentors, and have trained in all phenomena being empty of their own defining characteristics, they do not dedicate to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment having made a mental image of those bases, those objective referents, those buddhas, those roots of virtue, and those bases of meritorious action associated with rejoicing. 
Rather, they dedicate like this: not by way of duality and not by way of nonduality, not by way of signs and not by way of signlessness, not by way of apprehending and not by way of not apprehending, not by way of defilement and not by way of purification, and not by way of arising and not by way of cessation. 
“If, however, those bodhisattva great beings do not practice the practice of the six perfections, do not wait on many buddhas, have not generated the roots of virtue, have not been assisted by spiritual mentors, and have not trained in all phenomena being empty of their own defining characteristics, they dedicate to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment having made a mental image of those bases, those objective referents, those buddhas, those roots of virtue, and those bases of meritorious action associated with rejoicing.

“It is in that manner, Subhūti, that bodhisattva great beings should dedicate the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.” 
“Maitreya,” said Subhūti, “if the mind with which they rejoice—that mind dedicating the roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment—is extinct, has ceased, is nonexistent, and is transformed, and if these bases, these objective referents, and these roots of virtue are also extinct, have ceased, are nonexistent, and are transformed, what is that mind associated with rejoicing, what are those bases, what are those objective referents, and what are those roots of virtue that should be dedicated to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment? 
Does the mind dedicate the mind? 
Does a mind dedicate a mind in that manner, or, when a mind dedicates a mind, is there no meeting together of the two minds? 
That which is the essential nature of mind also cannot dedicate. 
“When bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, if they know that the perfection of wisdom is a nonentity, the perfection of meditative concentration is a nonentity, the perfection of perseverance is a nonentity, the perfection of tolerance is a nonentity, the perfection of ethical discipline is a nonentity, and the perfection of generosity is a nonentity; the emptiness of internal phenomena is a nonentity, the emptiness of external phenomena is a nonentity, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena is a nonentity, the emptiness of emptiness is a nonentity, the emptiness of great extent is a nonentity, the emptiness of ultimate reality is a nonentity, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena is a nonentity, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena is a nonentity, the emptiness of the unlimited is a nonentity, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is a nonentity, the emptiness of nonexclusion is a nonentity, the emptiness of inherent nature is a nonentity, the emptiness of all phenomena is a nonentity, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics is a nonentity, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended is a nonentity, the emptiness of nonentities is a nonentity, the emptiness of essential nature is a nonentity, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities is a nonentity; the applications of mindfulness are nonentities, the correct exertions are nonentities, the supports for miraculous ability are nonentities, the faculties are nonentities, the powers are nonentities, the branches of enlightenment are nonentities, and the noble eightfold path is a nonentity; the truths of the noble ones are nonentities, the meditative concentrations are nonentities, the immeasurable attitudes are nonentities, the formless absorptions are nonentities, the liberations are nonentities, the serial steps of meditative absorption are nonentities, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation are nonentities, the extrasensory powers are nonentities, the meditative stabilities are nonentities, the dhāraṇī gateways are nonentities, the ten powers of the tathāgatas are nonentities, the four fearlessnesses are nonentities, the four kinds of exact knowledge are nonentities, great compassion is a nonentity, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are nonentities; and the fruit of having entered the stream is a nonentity, the fruit of once-returner is a nonentity, the fruit of non-returner is a nonentity, arhatship is a nonentity, individual enlightenment is a nonentity, the knowledge of the aspects of the path is a nonentity, and all-aspect omniscience is a nonentity, bodhisattva great beings should dedicate in that manner the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
If they make the dedication in that manner, they will have made the dedication to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the elder Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, if bodhisattva great beings who have newly set out in the vehicle were to hear this teaching, they would be afraid and frightened—they would be terrified, would they not? 
Venerable monk Subhūti, how should bodhisattva great beings who have newly set out in the vehicle dedicate these roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment? 
How, having taken hold of the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing, do they dedicate it to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?” 
Then the venerable Subhūti, focused on the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, if those bodhisattva great beings who have newly set out in the vehicle practice the perfection of wisdom and grasp this perfection of wisdom, without apprehending it and by way of signlessness;

instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the four truths of the noble ones until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the four meditative concentrations until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the four immeasurable attitudes until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the four formless absorptions until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the eight liberations until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the nine serial steps of meditative absorption until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the five extrasensory powers until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the meditative stabilities until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the dhāraṇī gateways until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the ten powers of the tathāgatas until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the four fearlessnesses until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the four kinds of exact knowledge until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from great compassion until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity, and instructing them in such a way that they will not be separated in any way from the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas until they have entered a bodhisattva’s full maturity. 
“They will also teach them about the deeds of Māra, and, once they have heard about those deeds of Māra, how there will be no decrease or increase. 
If you ask why, it is because those deeds of Māra are without an essential nature. 
Until they enter a bodhisattva’s full maturity, they will not be separated from the lord buddhas, they will generate roots of virtue in relation to them, by these roots of virtue they will become secure in the family of bodhisattvas, and until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, they will never be separated from the family of bodhisattvas. 
“Moreover, Kauśika, bodhisattva great beings who have newly set out in the vehicle should gather together, compress into one, and take the measure of those merits accrued by the immeasurable, countless tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, and teaching the Dharma, along with their communities of śrāvakas, in the countless, immeasurable world systems in each of the eastern direction, southern direction, western direction, northern direction, intermediate northeastern direction, intermediate southeastern direction, intermediate southwestern direction, intermediate northwestern direction, and in the directions below and above—those lord buddhas who have cut off the modes of thought construction, whose use of words is unimpeded, whose burden has been relinquished, who have trodden down the thorns of the town, who have completely severed the fetters binding them to the rebirth process, and whose minds are thoroughly liberated by perfect understanding—and of those roots of virtue, as many as there are, generated in relation to them by those in great and lofty royal families, or those in great and lofty priestly families, or those in great and lofty householder families, or by the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, or the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, or the gods of the Yāma realm, or the gods of the Tuṣita realm, or the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, or the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm, or the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, or the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, or the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, or the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm, or the gods of the Ābha realm, or the gods of the Parīttābha realm, or the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, or the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm, or the gods of the Śubha realm, or the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, or the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, or the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm, or the gods of the Vṛha realm, or the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, or the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, or the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm, or the gods of the Avṛha realm, or the gods of the Atapa realm, or the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, or the gods of the Sudarśana realm, or the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm—or by anyone, whoever they are—and, having done so, should rejoice in them with the rejoicing that is excellent, foremost, best, supreme, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled. 
And having rejoiced, making common cause with all beings, they should dedicate those to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.” 
Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked the venerable Subhūti, “If bodhisattva great beings who have newly set out in the vehicle focus their thoughts, as is their habit, on all those roots of virtue of the lord buddhas and the communities of śrāvakas of the lord buddhas, and rejoice in them with the rejoicing that is excellent, foremost, best, supreme, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled, how will those bodhisattva great beings not have a mistaken perception, how will they not have a mistaken thought, and how will they not have a mistaken view?” 
“Maitreya,” replied Subhūti, “if those bodhisattva great beings focus their thoughts, as is their habit, on those lord buddhas and their communities of śrāvakas, and do not have a perception of a buddha, do not have a perception of a śrāvaka, do not have a perception of a root of virtue, and do not have a perception of a mind, even of that mind that makes the dedication, then the bodhisattva great beings who make the dedication in that manner will not have a mistaken perception, will not have a mistaken thought, and will not have a mistaken view. 
If those bodhisattva great beings take hold of a mental image and focus their thoughts, as is their habit, on those lord buddhas and their communities of śrāvakas and those roots of virtue, and, having taken hold of a mental image, dedicate them to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, that would be the mistaken perception, the mistaken thought, and the mistaken view of bodhisattva great beings. 
“If those bodhisattva great beings know, ‘The mind, when we focus our thoughts, as is our habit, on those lord buddhas and their communities of śrāvakas and those roots of virtue, is extinct just as those are extinct,’ and if they make the dedication thinking, ‘That which is extinct cannot dedicate. 
This is the reality of the mind—that very mind by which the dedication is made—and this is the reality of that phenomenon [enlightenment], the phenomenon to which the dedication is made,’ they make the dedication perfectly and it will not be erroneous. 
So that is the way bodhisattva great beings should dedicate the roots of virtue. 
“There are bodhisattva great beings who gather together, compress into one, and take the measure of the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment to as long as their Dharma remains; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, generated by many ordinary persons in relation to them; and the teachings of the Dharma that have been heard, as much as there are; and, in relation to that, the roots of virtue, as many as there are, generated by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, generated by those in great and lofty royal families, or those in great and lofty priestly families, or those in great and lofty householder families, or by the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, or the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, or the gods of the Yāma realm, or the gods of the Tuṣita realm, or the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, or the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm, or the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, or the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm, or the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm, or the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm, or the gods of the Ābha realm, or the gods of the Parīttābha realm, or the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm, or the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm, or the gods of the Śubha realm, or the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm, or the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm, or the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm, or the gods of the Vṛha realm, or the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm, or the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm, or the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm, or the gods of the Avṛha realm, or the gods of the Atapa realm, or the gods of the Sudṛśa realm, or the gods of the Sudarśana realm, or the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm; and the good Dharma that they have heard, as much as there is. 
If, having done so, they were to rejoice with the rejoicing that is excellent, foremost, best, supreme, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled, and dedicate all of that to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and if they were to make this dedication knowing, ‘Those phenomena are extinct, have ceased, are nonexistent, and are transformed, and that mind where the dedication is made is also empty of essential nature,’ then they will have made a dedication to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“ ‘Phenomena do not dedicate phenomena. 
If you ask why, it is because all phenomena are empty of an essential nature.’ 
If they know this and if they make the dedication accordingly, they will have made a dedication to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
So it is that when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, practice the perfection of meditative concentration, practice the perfection of perseverance, practice the perfection of tolerance, practice the perfection of ethical discipline, and practice the perfection of generosity, they will not have a mistaken perception, they will not have a mistaken thought, and they will not have a mistaken view. 
If you ask why, it is because these bodhisattva great beings are not attached to the dedication, are not attached to those roots of virtue, do not observe even enlightenment, and do not observe the mind set on enlightenment to which they could be attached. 
This is the unsurpassed dedication of bodhisattva great beings. 
“If bodhisattva great beings know that their accumulation of the basis of meritorious action is devoid of the aggregates, sensory elements, and sense fields; if they know that it is devoid of the perfection of wisdom, know that it is devoid of the perfection of meditative concentration, know that it is devoid of the perfection of perseverance, know that it is devoid of the perfection of tolerance, know that it is devoid of the perfection of ethical discipline, and know that it is devoid of the perfection of generosity; know that it is devoid of the emptiness of internal phenomena, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of external phenomena, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of emptiness, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of great extent, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of ultimate reality, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of the unlimited, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of nonexclusion, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of inherent nature, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of all phenomena, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of nonentities, know that it is devoid of the emptiness of essential nature, and know that it is devoid of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; know that it is devoid of the applications of mindfulness, know that it is devoid of the correct exertions, know that it is devoid of the supports for miraculous ability, know that it is devoid of the faculties, know that it is devoid of the powers, know that it is devoid of the branches of enlightenment, and know that it is devoid of the noble eightfold path; and know that it is devoid of the truths of the noble ones, know that it is devoid of the meditative concentrations, know that it is devoid of the immeasurable attitudes, know that it is devoid of the formless absorptions, know that it is devoid of the eight liberations, know that it is devoid of the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, know that it is devoid of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, know that it is devoid of the extrasensory powers, know that it is devoid of the meditative stabilities, know that it is devoid of the dhāraṇī gateways, know that it is devoid of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, know that it is devoid of the four fearlessnesses, know that it is devoid of the four kinds of exact knowledge, know that it is devoid of great loving kindness, know that it is devoid of great compassion, and know that it is devoid of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, in that way, Subhūti, the accumulation of the basis of meritorious action is dedicated by bodhisattva great beings to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“If bodhisattva great beings know that that accumulation of the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing is devoid of the essential nature of an accumulation of the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing, and if they know that those buddhas are devoid of the essential nature of a buddha, those roots of virtue are devoid of the essential nature of a root of virtue, those accumulations are devoid of the essential nature of an accumulation, that mind of enlightenment is devoid of the essential nature of a mind set on enlightenment, that dedication is devoid of the essential nature of a dedication, and that enlightenment is devoid of the essential nature of an enlightenment; the perfection of wisdom is devoid of the essential nature of a perfection of wisdom; that the perfection of meditative concentration is devoid of the essential nature of a perfection of meditative concentration, the perfection of perseverance is devoid of an essential nature of a perfection of perseverance, the perfection of tolerance is devoid of the essential nature of a perfection of tolerance, the perfection of ethical discipline is devoid of the essential nature of a perfection of ethical discipline, and the perfection of generosity is devoid of the essential nature of a perfection of generosity; that the emptiness of internal phenomena is devoid of an emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature is devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities is devoid of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; that the applications of mindfulness are devoid of the essential nature of an application of mindfulness, the correct exertions are devoid of the essential nature of a correct exertion, the supports for miraculous ability are devoid of the essential nature of a support for miraculous ability, the faculties are devoid of the essential nature of a faculty, the powers are devoid of the essential nature of a power, the branches of enlightenment are devoid of the essential nature of a branch of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path is devoid of a noble eightfold path; that the truths of the noble ones are devoid of a truth of the noble ones, the meditative concentrations are devoid of the essential nature of a meditative concentration, the immeasurable attitudes are devoid of the essential nature of an immeasurable attitude, the formless absorptions are devoid of the essential nature of a formless absorption, the eight liberations are devoid of the essential nature of a liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption are devoid of the essential nature of a serial step of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation are devoid of the essential nature of an emptiness, signlessness, or wishlessness gateway to liberation, the extrasensory powers are devoid of the essential nature of an extrasensory power, the meditative stabilities are devoid of the essential nature of a meditative stability, and the dhāraṇī gateways are devoid of the essential nature of a dhāraṇī gateway; and that the ten powers of the tathāgatas are devoid of the essential nature of a power of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses are devoid of the essential nature of a fearlessness, the four kinds of exact knowledge are devoid of the essential nature of a kind of exact knowledge, great compassion is devoid of a great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are devoid of a distinct quality of the buddhas, then those bodhisattva great beings should practice the perfection of wisdom that is void accordingly, because this is the perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings. 
“Moreover, when bodhisattva great beings dedicate the roots of virtue of those lord buddhas and their communities of śrāvakas who have passed into final nirvāṇa, they should make the dedication like this: Just as those lord buddhas have passed into final nirvāṇa, these roots of virtue, too, have passed into final nirvāṇa. 
Just like those roots of virtue, as they really are, this dedication too has passed into final nirvāṇa. 
And that mind that is the mind by which the dedication is made is of a similar type, which is to say, has that as its essential nature. 
When they understand like that, the dedication has been made to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and when the dedication has been made in that manner, they will not have a mistaken perception, they will not have a mistaken thought, and they will not have a mistaken view. 
“When bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, if they perceive those roots of virtue of those lord buddhas by way of a mental image, they do not make a dedication to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
‘All the lord buddhas of the past, as many as there are, are not mental images—they are not within the scope of mental images.’ 
Even if they focus their thoughts, as they habitually do, like that, they still make them into mental images and do not dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
In that way they will have a mistaken perception, they will have a mistaken thought, and they will have a mistaken view. 
“If bodhisattva great beings do not perceive those lord buddhas, those roots of virtue, those accumulations, and those settings of the mind on enlightenment, and do not make them into mental images, they dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
In that way they will not have a mistaken perception, they will not have a mistaken thought, and they will not have a mistaken view.” 
“Venerable monk Subhūti,” asked Maitreya, “how do bodhisattva great beings not make a mental image of those roots of virtue and dedicate them to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?” 
“Bodhisattva great beings should train in those skillful means in this perfection of wisdom,” replied Subhūti. 
“They should know about the skillful means of bodhisattva great beings from the perfection of wisdom. 
Without relying on the perfection of wisdom, it is not possible to dedicate the basis of meritorious action.” 
Maitreya then said, “Should one think, ‘Would there not be the fault that in the perfection of wisdom those lord buddhas do not exist and are not apprehended, those roots of virtue do not exist and are not apprehended, those accumulations do not exist and are not apprehended, and those settings of the mind by which the dedication is made to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment do not exist and are not apprehended?’ 
in regard to that, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom they should make an investigation as follows: ‘If those bodies of theirs have ceased, those roots of virtue have ceased, those accumulations have ceased, and those settings of the mind on enlightenment have ceased, how, having made them mental images, could there be any conception of those lord buddhas, those roots of virtue, those accumulations, and those settings of the mind on enlightenment?’ 
“The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas do not rejoice in and praise dedication by way of mental images in that manner. 
If you ask why, it is because making a mental image of the lord buddhas who have passed into final nirvāṇa, and conceiving of them and apprehending them, is their major act of apprehending. 
So it is that bodhisattva great beings who wish to dedicate those roots of virtue should make the dedication without apprehending and without making mental images. 
The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas do not say that a dedication of someone with the perception of an objective referent and with the perception of a mental image is of great value. 
If you ask why, it is because that dedication would be poisonous and painful. 
“To illustrate, it would be just like perfect food of excellent color and excellent aroma, mixed with poison—even though the color, aroma, and taste may well be pleasant, it nonetheless would end up being poisonous. 
Persons of a childish disposition or disposed to intellectual confusion think it is edible, but if they do indeed eat it, even though they experience the color, aroma, and good taste, it transforms into suffering and the ripening of suffering. 
“Similarly, here some with wrong awareness, wrong cognition, and wrong training, who do not realize and do not understand the meaning, will teach as follows: ‘Come here, child of a good family. 
You should gather together, compress into one, and take the measure of all those roots of virtue, as many as there are, that the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment, up to fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, up to when they passed into final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no aggregates are left behind, and up until the disappearance of the good Dharma have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of wisdom; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of meditative concentration; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of perseverance; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of tolerance; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of ethical discipline; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of generosity; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four meditative concentrations; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four immeasurable attitudes; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four formless absorptions; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the five extrasensory powers; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four applications of mindfulness; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four correct exertions; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four supports for miraculous ability; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the five faculties; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the five powers; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the seven branches of enlightenment; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the noble eightfold path; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four truths of the noble ones; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the eight liberations; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the nine serial steps of meditative absorption; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the meditative stabilities; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the dhāraṇī gateways; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the ten powers of the tathāgatas; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four fearlessnesses; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four kinds of exact knowledge; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated great compassion; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they accumulate, through which they have refined, are refining, and will refine many buddhafields and through which they have brought to maturity, are bringing to maturity, and will bring to maturity many beings; the lord buddhas’ aggregate of ethical discipline, aggregate of meditative stability, aggregate of wisdom, aggregate of liberation, aggregate of the knowledge and seeing of liberation, knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one, state where the attributes do not decline, and abiding in perpetual equanimity; the uncontaminated roots of virtue of those śrāvakas; those roots of virtue on account of which one has rejoiced, is rejoicing, and will rejoice in them, and on account of which the pratyekabuddhas have been, are being, and will be prophesied by those lord buddhas; and the roots of virtue that have been generated, are being generated, and will be generated by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, and you should dedicate these to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ 
“When a dedication is made with a dedication by way of a mental image and an apprehended object in that manner, it becomes poisonous. 
It is like that poisonous food in the illustration. 
For those who have a perception of an apprehended object there is no dedication. 
And why? 
Because that apprehending is poisonous, has a causal sign, has causes, and has conditions. 
If they dedicate in such a manner, they will deprecate the tathāgatas, will not speak as the tathāgatas have spoken, and will also not speak in accord with the Dharma.” 
“So how, then, should sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas rejoice in and dedicate the roots of virtue of the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present? 
How, when they rejoice in all those roots of virtue, as many as there are, that the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment, up to fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, up to when they passed into final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no aggregates are left behind, and up until the disappearance of the good Dharma have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having practiced the perfection of wisdom;

the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the five faculties; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the five powers; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the seven branches of enlightenment; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the noble eightfold path;

the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the ten powers of the tathāgatas; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four fearlessnesses; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated the four kinds of exact knowledge; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated great compassion; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they have accumulated, are accumulating, and will accumulate from having cultivated and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, that they accumulate, through which they have refined, are refining, and will refine many buddhafields and through which they have brought to maturity, are bringing to maturity, and will bring to maturity many beings; the lord buddhas’ aggregate of ethical discipline, aggregate of meditative stability, aggregate of wisdom, aggregate of liberation, aggregate of the knowledge and seeing of liberation, knowledge of an all-aspect omniscient one, state where the attributes do not decline, and abiding in perpetual equanimity; the uncontaminated roots of virtue of those śrāvakas; those roots of virtue on account of which one has rejoiced, is rejoicing, and will rejoice in them, and on account of which the pratyekabuddhas have been, are being, and will be prophesied by those lord buddhas; and the roots of virtue that have been generated, are being generated, and will be generated by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, and when they dedicate them, should they not train, thinking that they will dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?” 
“Maitreya,” said Subhūti, “here sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas practicing the perfection of wisdom with the wish not to deprecate the tathāgatas should dedicate in the following manner: ‘I should rejoice in those roots of virtue just as those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas comprehend, know, and understand, with the unsurpassed transcendental knowledge of the buddhas, their natural conditions, essential natures, and defining characteristics, on account of which reality of phenomena they exist. 
Just as those lord buddhas comprehend them, I will dedicate them to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ 
It is in this manner that the sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas should dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
If they dedicate in such a manner, they will not deprecate the tathāgatas, will speak as the tathāgatas have spoken, and will also speak in accord with the Dharma. 
Practicing in that manner, that dedication of bodhisattva great beings will not be poisonous and will be a perfect nectar of immortality.

“If the sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas dedicate those roots of virtuous action by way of a mental image or by way of apprehending, that is a dedication made in the wrong way, not a dedication that is perfect. 
A dedication made in the wrong way is not praised by the lord buddhas. 
“Through that dedication that is not praised by the lord buddhas they do not complete the perfection of generosity, do not complete the perfection of ethical discipline, do not complete the perfection of tolerance, do not complete the perfection of perseverance, do not complete the perfection of meditative concentration, and do not complete the perfection of wisdom; they do not complete the emptiness of internal phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of external phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of emptiness, do not complete the emptiness of great extent, do not complete the emptiness of ultimate reality, do not complete the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of the unlimited, do not complete the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, do not complete the emptiness of nonexclusion, do not complete the emptiness of inherent nature, do not complete the emptiness of all phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, do not complete the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, do not complete the emptiness of nonentities, do not complete the emptiness of essential nature, and do not complete the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; they do not complete the applications of mindfulness, do not complete the correct exertions, do not complete the supports for miraculous ability, do not complete the faculties, do not complete the powers, do not complete the branches of enlightenment, and do not complete the noble eightfold path; and they do not complete the truths of the noble ones, do not complete the meditative concentrations, do not complete the immeasurable attitudes, do not complete the formless absorptions, do not complete the eight liberations, do not complete the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, do not complete the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, do not complete the extrasensory powers, do not complete the meditative stabilities, do not complete the dhāraṇī gateways, do not complete the ten powers of the tathāgatas, do not complete the four fearlessnesses, do not complete the four kinds of exact knowledge, do not complete great compassion, and do not complete the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
“Those who do not complete the perfection of generosity, do not complete the perfection of ethical discipline, do not complete the perfection of tolerance, do not complete the perfection of perseverance, do not complete the perfection of meditative concentration, and do not complete the perfection of wisdom; who do not complete the emptiness of internal phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of external phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of emptiness, do not complete the emptiness of great extent, do not complete the emptiness of ultimate reality, do not complete the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of the unlimited, do not complete the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, do not complete the emptiness of nonexclusion, do not complete the emptiness of inherent nature, do not complete the emptiness of all phenomena, do not complete the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, do not complete the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, do not complete the emptiness of nonentities, do not complete the emptiness of essential nature, and do not complete the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; who do not complete the applications of mindfulness, do not complete the correct exertions, do not complete the supports for miraculous ability, do not complete the faculties, do not complete the powers, do not complete the branches of enlightenment, and do not complete the noble eightfold path; and who do not complete the truths of the noble ones, do not complete the meditative concentrations, do not complete the immeasurable attitudes, do not complete the formless absorptions, do not complete the eight liberations, do not complete the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, do not complete the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, do not complete the extrasensory powers, do not complete the meditative stabilities, do not complete the dhāraṇī gateways, do not complete the ten powers of the tathāgatas, do not complete the four fearlessnesses, do not complete the four kinds of exact knowledge, do not complete great compassion, and do not complete the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas will not refine a buddhafield, and they will not bring beings to maturity. 
Those who have not refined a buddhafield and brought beings to maturity will not fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
If you ask why, it is because that dedication is poisonous. 
“Moreover, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom they should make an investigation as follows: ‘Just as the lord buddhas comprehended that those roots of virtue should be dedicated based on this reality of phenomena, and that when the dedication has been made in that manner it will become the best of dedications, similarly I too should dedicate them, based on this reality of phenomena, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ ” 
Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Subhūti, “Excellent, excellent, Subhūti! 
Subhūti, you, as you thus teach the aggregate of dedication of bodhisattva great beings by way of signlessness, by way of not apprehending anything, by way of nonarising, by way of nonceasing, by way of nondefilement, by way of nonpurification, by way of the essential nature of nonentities, by way of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, by way of the emptiness of essential nature, by way of the realm of phenomena, by way of the real nature, and by way of the one and only real nature, you, Subhūti, do the work of the Teacher. 
“Subhūti, if all those beings of this great billionfold world system were to obtain the paths of the ten virtuous actions, were to obtain the four meditative concentrations, were to obtain the four immeasurable attitudes, were to obtain the four formless absorptions, and were to obtain the five extrasensory powers, do you think, Subhūti, the merit of those beings for that reason would have increased greatly?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord! 
Greatly, Well-Gone One!” 
replied Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” continued the Blessed One, “the merit of those sons or daughters of good families who dedicate the roots of virtue with a dedication free from attachment increase even more greatly than theirs. 
So it is, Subhūti, that this dedication of the roots of virtue of those sons or daughters of good families is said to be supreme, is said to be the best, is said to be excellent, is said to be the foremost, is said to be the greatest, is said to be perfect, is said to be unsurpassed, and is said to be unexcelled. 
“Moreover, Subhūti, if all those beings of this great billionfold world system, as many as there are, were to have become those who have entered the stream, were to have become once-returners, were to have become non-returners, or were to have become arhats, and if some sons or daughters of good families for the duration of their lives were to serve, respect, honor, and worship all of those who had entered the stream, had become once-returners, had become non-returners, and had become arhats with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—do you think, Subhūti, that the merit of those sons or daughters of good families for that reason would have increased greatly?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord! 
Greatly, Well-Gone One!” 
replied Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” continued the Blessed One, “the merit of those sons or daughters of good families who dedicate the roots of virtue with a dedication free from attachment increase even more greatly than theirs. 
So it is, Subhūti, that this dedication of the roots of virtue of those sons or daughters of good families is said to be supreme, is said to be the best, is said to be excellent, is said to be the foremost, is said to be the greatest, is said to be perfect, is said to be unsurpassed, and is said to be unexcelled. 
“Moreover, Subhūti, if all those beings of this great billionfold world system, as many as there are, were to have become pratyekabuddhas, and if some sons or daughters of good families were to serve, respect, honor, and worship them with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—do you think, Subhūti, that the merit of those sons or daughters of good families for that reason would have increased greatly?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord! 
Greatly, Well-Gone One!” 
replied Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” continued the Blessed One, “the merit of those sons or daughters of good families who dedicate the roots of virtue with a dedication free from attachment increases even more greatly than theirs. 
So it is, Subhūti, that this dedication of the roots of virtue of those sons or daughters of good families is said to be supreme, is said to be the best, is said to be excellent, is said to be the foremost, is said to be the greatest, is said to be perfect, is said to be unsurpassed, and is said to be unexcelled. 
“Moreover, Subhūti, if all those beings of this great billionfold world system, as many as there are, were to have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and if all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the direction below, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness; and all those beings, as many as there are, in the world systems of the direction above, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were, for eons as numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, to serve, respect, honor, and worship each of those bodhisattva great beings with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and were to serve them with all the everyday necessities for happiness, do you think, Subhūti, that the merit of those sons or daughters of good families for that reason would have increased greatly?” 
“Greatly, Blessed Lord, greatly, Well-Gone One!” 
replied Subhūti. 
“Blessed Lord, it would be immeasurable, incalculable, and boundless. 
Blessed Lord, it would be hard to exemplify that basis of meritorious action. 
Blessed Lord, if that basis of meritorious action were material, it could not be accommodated even in all the world systems, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā.” 
The Blessed One then said, “Excellent, Subhūti, excellent! 
It is so, it is as you have said. 
Subhūti, the merit of those sons or daughters of good families who dedicate the roots of virtue with a dedication free from attachment increases even more greatly than theirs. 
So it is, Subhūti, that this dedication of the roots of virtue of those sons or daughters of good families is said to be supreme, is said to be the best, is said to be excellent, is said to be the foremost, is said to be the greatest, is said to be perfect, is said to be unsurpassed, and is said to be unexcelled. 
“Subhūti, that earlier root of virtue would come nowhere near even a hundredth part, would come nowhere near even a thousandth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred thousandth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a thousand ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred thousand ten millionth part, would come nowhere near even a hundred thousand ten million billionth part, and would not stand up to any other number, fraction, calculation, example, or comparison of this dedication that is free from attachment. 
“If you ask why, it is because those sons or daughters of good families who have come into possession of the path of the ten virtuous actions, and who have come into possession of the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, and the five extrasensory powers, have a perception that apprehends something. 
Similarly, those sons or daughters of good families who serve, respect, honor, and worship all the beings who have entered the stream, all the beings who have become once-returners, all the beings who have become non-returners, all the beings who have become arhats, and all the beings who have become pratyekabuddhas with many of the basic necessities—robes, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—have a perception that apprehends something.” 
Then the Four Great Kings, along with twenty thousand gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, with their palms together, joyously paid homage to the Blessed One, and said, “O Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in means in that manner dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of nonattachment, by way of signlessness, and by way of nonaction. 
That dedication that thus, by whatever means, avoids becoming dual and avoids becoming nondual is the extremely great dedication of bodhisattva great beings.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, along with many thousands of gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, held up divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and while playing various divine musical instruments, sprinkled, scattered, and showered over the Blessed One those divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and spoke these words: “Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in means in that manner dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of signlessness, and by way of nonaction. 
That dedication that thus, by whatever means, avoids becoming dual and avoids becoming nondual is the extremely great dedication of bodhisattva great beings.” 
Then the god Suyāma, along with many thousands of gods of the Yāma realm, held up divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and while playing various divine musical instruments, sprinkled, scattered, and showered over the Blessed One those divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and spoke these words: “Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in means in that manner dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of signlessness, and by way of nonaction. 
That dedication that thus, by whatever means, avoids becoming dual and avoids becoming nondual is the extremely great dedication of bodhisattva great beings.” 
Then the god Saṃtuṣita, along with many thousands of gods of the Tuṣita realm, held up divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and while playing various divine musical instruments, sprinkled, scattered, and showered over the Blessed One those divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and spoke these words: “Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in means in that manner dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of signlessness, and by way of nonaction. 
That dedication that thus, by whatever means, avoids becoming dual and avoids becoming nondual is the extremely great dedication of bodhisattva great beings.” 
Then the god Sunirmānarati, along with many thousands of gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, held up divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and while playing various divine musical instruments, sprinkled, scattered, and showered over the Blessed One those divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and spoke these words: “Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in means in that manner dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of signlessness, and by way of nonaction. 
That dedication that thus, by whatever means, avoids becoming dual and avoids becoming nondual is the extremely great dedication of bodhisattva great beings.” 
Then the god Vaśavartin, along with many thousands of gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm, held up divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and while playing various divine musical instruments, sprinkled, scattered, and showered over the Blessed One those divine flowers, divine perfumes, divine garlands, divine incenses, divine unguents, divine powders, divine robes, divine parasols, divine victory banners, and divine flags, and spoke these words: “Blessed Lord, bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in means in that manner dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of signlessness, and by way of nonaction. 
That dedication that thus, by whatever means, avoids becoming dual and avoids becoming nondual is the extremely great dedication of bodhisattva great beings.” 
Then many ten million billion gods of the Brahmakāyika realm arrived at that place where the Blessed One was, prostrated with the crowns of their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and giving voice to the following words, loudly proclaimed: “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that those bodhisattva great beings who are assisted by the perfection of wisdom and skill in means outshine the roots of virtue of the aforementioned sons and daughters of good families who are without skillful means and who are engaged in apprehending.” 
Then many hundred thousand ten million billion gods of the Brahmapurohita realm arrived at that place where the Blessed One was, prostrated with the crowns of their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and giving voice to the following words, loudly proclaimed: “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that those bodhisattva great beings who are assisted by the perfection of wisdom and skill in means outshine the roots of virtue of the aforementioned sons and daughters of good families who are without skillful means and who are engaged in apprehending.” 
Then many hundred thousand ten million billion gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm arrived at that place where the Blessed One was, prostrated with the crowns of their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and giving voice to the following words, loudly proclaimed: “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that those bodhisattva great beings who are assisted by the perfection of wisdom and skill in means outshine the roots of virtue of the aforementioned sons and daughters of good families who are without skillful means and who are engaged in apprehending.” 
Then many hundred thousand ten million billion gods of the Vṛhatphala realm arrived at that place where the Blessed One was, prostrated with the crowns of their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and giving voice to the following words, loudly proclaimed: “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that those bodhisattva great beings who are assisted by the perfection of wisdom and skill in means outshine the roots of virtue of the aforementioned sons and daughters of good families who are without skillful means and who are engaged in apprehending.” 
Then many hundred thousand ten million billion gods of the Śuddhāvāsa realms arrived at that place where the Blessed One was, prostrated with the crowns of their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and giving voice to the following words, loudly proclaimed: “Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that those bodhisattva great beings who are assisted by the perfection of wisdom and skill in means outshine the roots of virtue of the aforementioned sons of good families and daughters of good families who are without skillful means and who are engaged in apprehending.” 
Then the Blessed One said to the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm; to the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma, the gods of the Tuṣita, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realms; and the gods of the Brahmakāyika, the gods of the Brahmapurohita, the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna, the gods of the Vṛhatphala realms, and to the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa realms, “Gods, if all those beings of this great billionfold world system, as many as there are, were to have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and if they were to have gathered together into one, and rejoiced in, the perfection of generosity, or perfection of ethical discipline, or perfection of tolerance, or perfection of perseverance, or perfection of meditative concentration, or perfection of wisdom; or the generosity, or ethical discipline, or tolerance, or perseverance, or meditative concentration, or wisdom; or the aggregate of ethical discipline, or aggregate of meditative stability, or aggregate of wisdom, or aggregate of liberation, or aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation of those past, future, and present tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the ten directions, along with their śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas––of all those lord buddhas from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment, up to for as long as their Dharma remains, of those śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and of beings––or in any of the other immeasurable attributes of the buddhas, whatever they might be, and having rejoiced in that manner, were to dedicate these to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of apprehending anything; and were a son or daughter of a good family who has set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening, who has gathered together into one, and rejoiced with the rejoicing that is excellent, with the rejoicing that is foremost, best, supreme, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled in the perfection of generosity, or perfection of ethical discipline, or perfection of tolerance, or perfection of perseverance, or perfection of meditative concentration, or perfection of wisdom; or the emptiness of internal phenomena, or the emptiness of external phenomena, or the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, or the emptiness of emptiness, or the emptiness of great extent, or the emptiness of ultimate reality, or the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, or the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, or the emptiness of the unlimited, or the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, or the emptiness of nonexclusion, or the emptiness of inherent nature, or the emptiness of all phenomena, or the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, or the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, or the emptiness of nonentities, or the emptiness of essential nature, or the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; or the applications of mindfulness, or the correct exertions, or the supports for miraculous ability, or the faculties, or the powers, or the branches of enlightenment, or the noble eightfold path; or the truths of the noble ones, or the meditative concentrations, or the immeasurable attitudes, or the formless absorptions, or the liberations, or the serial steps of meditative absorption, or the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, or the extrasensory powers, or the meditative stabilities, or the dhāraṇī gateways, or the ten powers of the tathāgatas, or the four fearlessnesses, or the four kinds of exact knowledge, or great loving kindness, or great compassion, or the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; or the fruit of having entered the stream, or the fruit of once-returner, or the fruit of non-returner, or arhatship, or individual enlightenment, or the knowledge of the aspects of the path, or all-aspect omniscience of those past, future, and present those lord buddhas along with their śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, or in any of the other immeasurable attributes of the buddhas, whatever they might be, and having rejoiced in them were to dedicate those roots of virtuous action associated with rejoicing to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, by way of nonduality, by way of signlessness, by way of nonattachment, and by way of nonaction, that son or daughter of a good family would increase the merit even more. 
“That earlier root of virtue would come nowhere near even a hundredth part; would come nowhere near even a thousandth part, a hundred thousandth part, a ten millionth part, a hundred ten millionth part, a thousand ten millionth part, a hundred thousand ten millionth part, or even a hundred thousand ten million billionth part; and would not stand up to any other number, fraction, calculation, example, or comparison of this dedication of the roots of virtue. 
This dedication of bodhisattva great beings that is made without apprehending anything is said to be excellent, is said to be the foremost, is said to be the best, is said to be supreme, is said to be perfect, is said to be the greatest, is said to be unsurpassed, is said to be unexcelled, is said to be unequaled, and is said to be equal to the unequaled.” 
Then the venerable Subhūti asked the Blessed One, “When the Blessed Lord says that the sons or daughters of good families, having gathered together, compressed into one, and taken the measure of all those roots of virtue, rejoice in them with the rejoicing that is supreme, rejoice in them with the rejoicing that is foremost, best, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled, Blessed Lord, why is it the best rejoicing? 
Why is it the rejoicing that is foremost, best, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled?” 
The Blessed One replied, “When sons or daughters of good families neither accept nor reject, neither give rise to conceit about nor feel humbled by, and neither apprehend nor do not apprehend those roots of virtue of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas along with their communities of śrāvakas, those pratyekabuddhas, and those beings of the past, future, and present, and think that in them a phenomenon does not arise, does not cease, is not defiled, is not purified, does not decrease, does not increase, does not come, does not go, and does not become an aggregate, they therefore say, for this reason, ‘I will rejoice just like the real nature of past, future, and present phenomena is, and just as the unmistaken real nature, the one and only real nature, the reality of phenomena, the abiding nature of phenomena, and the maturity of phenomena is. 
I will rejoice like that, and having rejoiced, I will dedicate to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ 
That rejoicing of bodhisattva great beings when they dedicate in that manner is the best. 
Those rejoicings are the foremost, the best, excellent, perfect, the greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled. 
“Subhūti, all other rejoicings other than this one come nowhere near even a hundredth part, come nowhere near even a thousandth part, a hundred thousandth part, a ten millionth part, a hundred ten millionth part, a thousand ten millionth part, a hundred thousand ten millionth part, or even a hundred thousand ten million billionth part of this rejoicing, so this rejoicing is said to be supreme in comparison to the rejoicings other than that, and is said to be the foremost, is said to be the best, is said to be excellent, is said to be perfect, is said to be the greatest, is said to be unsurpassed, is said to be unexcelled, is said to be unequaled, and is said to be equal to the unequaled. 
“Moreover, Subhūti, when sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas wish to rejoice in the roots of virtue associated with the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom, and the aggregates of ethical discipline, meditative stability, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge and seeing of liberation, as many as there are, of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past, future, and present, along with their śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment, up to for as long as their Dharma remains, as well as any of the other immeasurable attributes of the buddhas, whatever they might be, and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of beings––in all of those––then they should rejoice as follows: ‘Just like liberation are physical forms.

Thus, just like the reality of phenomena as it pertains to phenomena that are not attached, are not bound, are not liberated, are not fixated, are not defiled, and are not purified, and the reality of phenomena as it pertains to phenomena that are have not arisen, have not completely arisen, have not originated, and are unceasing, they dedicate to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, based on a state that does not change places and is not destroyed. 
“Subhūti, this is the rejoicing of bodhisattva great beings that is supreme. 
This is the rejoicing that is foremost, the best, excellent, perfect, the greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled. 
Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings who possess this rejoicing will swiftly fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Moreover, Subhūti, there are the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the eastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the southern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the western direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the northern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the direction below, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā; and the lord buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas who are presently residing and maintaining themselves, as many as there are, teaching the Dharma in the world systems of the direction above, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā. 
If any sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas were, for the duration of their lives, to serve, respect, honor, and worship those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas with their communities of śrāvakas with many of the basic necessities—food, alms, bedding, and medications owing to ill health—and many comforts, and if, even after those lord buddhas had passed into final nirvāṇa, feeling an enthusiasm for serving, respecting, honoring, and worshiping their relics, day and night, with many flowers, garlands, incense, unguents, perfumes, powders, robes, parasols, victory banners, and flags, they were to undertake acts of generosity by way of apprehending it, maintain ethical discipline by way of apprehending it, cultivate tolerance by way of apprehending it, undertake perseverance by way of apprehending it, become absorbed in meditative concentration by way of apprehending it, and cultivate wisdom by way of apprehending it, in comparison to them, when sons or daughters of good families who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment practice the perfection of generosity without apprehending it, practice the perfection of ethical discipline without apprehending it, practice the perfection of tolerance without apprehending it, practice the perfection of perseverance without apprehending it, practice the perfection of meditative concentration without apprehending it, and practice the perfection of wisdom without apprehending it, if they dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment with skill in means, the accumulation of that earlier merit would come nowhere near even a hundredth part, would come nowhere near even a thousandth part, a hundred thousandth part, a hundred ten millionth part, a thousand ten millionth part, a hundred thousand ten millionth part, or a hundred thousand ten million billionth part, and would not stand up to any other number, fraction, calculation, example, or comparison of this accumulation of merit, this accumulation of roots of virtue. 
Just this dedication is said to be supreme, is said to be the foremost, is said to be the best, is said to be excellent, is said to be perfect, is said to be the greatest, is said to be unsurpassed, and is said to be unexcelled. 
“Subhūti, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of generosity, practice the perfection of ethical discipline, practice the perfection of tolerance, practice the perfection of perseverance, practice the perfection of meditative concentration, and practice the perfection of wisdom without apprehending them, they should dedicate those roots of virtue to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, with skill in means.” 
This completes the twenty-fourth chapter, “Dedication,” from The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines. 
Chapter 25 Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom sheds light owing to its utter purity. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is worthy of homage. 
Blessed Lord, I pay homage to the perfection of wisdom. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is unsullied by all the three realms. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom dispels all the blindness of afflictive mental states and views, rendering visual distortion nonexistent. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom, among the factors conducive to enlightenment, is supreme. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom secures happiness so that all fears, enmity, and harms may be purified. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom brings light to all beings so that they might acquire the five eyes. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom teaches the path to those who are going astray so that they might turn back from the extremes. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom establishes all-aspect omniscience, so that all the afflicted mental states and their connecting propensities might be abandoned. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom generates the attributes of the buddhas so it is the mother of bodhisattva great beings. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom, because of the emptiness of its intrinsic defining characteristics, has neither arisen nor ceased. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is the antidote to saṃsāra because it is neither permanent, nor has it perished. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is the protector of beings without a protector because it bestows the entirety of the precious doctrine. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom works as the ten powers because it cannot be crushed. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom turns the wheel of the Dharma, that turns three times in twelve ways, because it is subject to neither promulgation nor reversal. 
Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom displays the essential nature of all phenomena because of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities. 
“Blessed Lord, how can bodhisattvas or those in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, śrāvakas or those in the vehicle of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas or those in the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas dwell in the perfection of wisdom?” 
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “they should dwell in the perfection of wisdom, just as they dwell with the Teacher. 
They should pay homage to the perfection of wisdom, just as they pay homage to the Teacher. 
If you ask why, it is because the perfection of wisdom is itself the Teacher. 
The Teacher is not one thing, and the perfection of wisdom another. 
The Teacher himself is the perfection of wisdom and the perfection of wisdom itself is the Teacher. 
“This is why the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas emerge, the bodhisattva great beings emerge, the pratyekabuddhas emerge, the arhats emerge, non-returners emerge, once-returners emerge, and those who have entered the stream emerge from the perfection of wisdom; and why the path of the ten virtuous actions, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, and the five extrasensory powers; the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; the four truths of the noble ones, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities, the dhāraṇī gateways, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four fearlessnesses, the four kinds of exact knowledge, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; and the fruit of having entered the stream, the fruit of once-returner, the fruit of non-returner, arhatship, individual enlightenment, the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and all-aspect omniscience emerge.” 
Thereupon, Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, thought, “From what has this question of the venerable monk Śāradvatīputra arisen? 
What is the reason?” 
Venerable Śāradvatīputra then said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, my question has arisen because bodhisattva great beings, assisted by the perfection of wisdom, with skillful means, having gathered together into one all those roots of virtue of those lord buddhas, from the time the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present first set their mind on enlightenment, up to for as long as their Dharma remains, along with their communities of śrāvakas, and of the pratyekabuddhas, and of all those beings, have dedicated them to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
“Kauśika, this perfection of wisdom of bodhisattva great beings outshines the perfection of generosity, and outshines the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, and the perfection of meditative concentration. 
To illustrate, Kauśika, it is just as those who are born blind, whether they number a hundred, a thousand, or a hundred thousand, cannot set out on the road without a guide. 
How could they ever travel to a city? 
In the same way, Kauśika, those five other perfections are like those who are born blind. 
If there is no perfection of wisdom, they will have no guide, so if they cannot even generate the path of enlightenment, how could they ever set out for the city of all-aspect omniscience? 
Kauśika, when the five perfections have been assisted by the perfection of wisdom, then they have eyes. 
When those five perfections are assisted by the perfection of wisdom they get the name perfection.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Venerable monk Śāradvatīputra, you say, ‘When those five perfections are assisted by the perfection of wisdom they get the name perfection.’ 
Venerable monk Śāradvatīputra, in addition to that, the five perfections, when they are assisted by the perfection of generosity, also get the name perfection. 
The five perfections, when they are assisted by the perfection of ethical discipline, also get the name perfection. 
The five perfections, when they are assisted by the perfection of tolerance, also get the name perfection. 
The five perfections, when they are assisted by the perfection of perseverance, also get the name perfection. 
The five perfections, when they are assisted by the perfection of meditative concentration, also get the name perfection.” 
“Kauśika,” he replied, “that is not so. 
That is not so. 
The five perfections do not get the name perfection because they are assisted by perfection of generosity. 
The five perfections do not get the name perfection because they are assisted by perfection of ethical discipline. 
The five perfections do not get the name perfection because they are assisted by perfection of tolerance. 
The five perfections do not get the name perfection because they are assisted by perfection of perseverance. 
The five perfections do not get the name perfection because they are assisted by perfection of meditative concentration. 
But the five perfections assisted by the perfection of wisdom do get the name perfection. 
“Kauśika, bodhisattva great beings who dwell in the perfection of wisdom fully perfect the perfection of generosity, and fully perfect the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of meditative concentration, and the perfection of wisdom. 
So it is, Kauśika, that the perfection of wisdom is said to be supreme, and is said to be the foremost, the best, excellent, perfect, the greatest, unsurpassed, and unexcelled.” 
Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, how should that perfection of wisdom be clearly achieved?” 
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatīputra, the perfection of wisdom should be clearly achieved in order that physical forms are not clearly achieved.

“Blessed Lord, what phenomenon does the perfection of wisdom that has been clearly achieved in that manner cause to be attained?” 
asked Śāradvatīputra. 
“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “the perfection of wisdom that has been clearly achieved in that manner causes no phenomenon at all to be attained, and when is does not cause any phenomenon at all to be attained, at that time it comes to be styled the perfection of wisdom.” 
“Blessed Lord, what are all those phenomena that it does not cause to be attained?” 
asked Śāradvatīputra. 
The Blessed One replied, “It does not cause nonvirtuous phenomena to be attained and does not cause virtuous phenomena to be attained; it does not cause mundane phenomena to be attained and does not cause supramundane phenomena to be attained; it does not cause contaminated phenomena to be attained and does not cause uncontaminated phenomena to be attained; it does not cause phenomena that are basic transgressions to be attained and does not cause phenomena that are not basic transgressions to be attained; and it does not cause conditioned phenomena to be attained and does not cause unconditioned phenomena to be attained. 
If you ask why, it is because the perfection of wisdom has not been established for the sake of any phenomenon at all by way of apprehending it. 
For this reason, it does not cause any phenomenon at all to be attained.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, does this perfection of wisdom not even cause all-aspect omniscience to be attained?” 
“Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “you have asked, ‘Does this perfection of wisdom not even cause all-aspect omniscience to be attained?’ 
Kauśika, it is so, it is so! 
This perfection of wisdom does not cause even all-aspect omniscience to be attained and does not apprehend it.” 
“Blessed Lord, in what way does the perfection of wisdom not cause even all-aspect omniscience to be attained and does not apprehend it?” 
asked Śakra. 
“Kauśika,” replied the Blessed One, “just like a name, just like a mental image, and just like a conditioning, the perfection of wisdom does not cause it to be attained.” 
“Blessed Lord, how then does it cause attainment?” 
asked Śakra. 
The Blessed One replied, “It causes it to be attained insofar as it does not apprehend, does not accept, does not dwell, does not abandon, and is not attached, but it does not cause anything to be attained. 
Kauśika, so it is that the perfection of wisdom does not cause any phenomenon to be attained. 
It does not cause the attainment of anything at all.” 
Śakra said, “Blessed Lord, how wonderful that this perfection of wisdom is thus established for the nonarising, the nonceasing, the nonconditioning, the nonapprehending, and the nondeterioration of all phenomena.” 
Thereupon, the venerable Subhūti said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, if they were to have such perceptions as ‘the perfection of wisdom causes the attainment of all phenomena’ or ‘the perfection of wisdom does not cause the attainment of all phenomena,’ in that case, Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings would abandon the perfection of wisdom. 
Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings would distance themselves from the perfection of wisdom.” 
“Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “there is a specific way in which bodhisattva great beings abandon the perfection of wisdom and distance themselves from the perfection of wisdom, and such a way is if, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they perceive, ‘Alas! 
This perfection of wisdom is hollow. 
Alas! 
This perfection of wisdom is in vain. 
Alas! 
This perfection of wisdom is pointless.’ 
In that case, those bodhisattva great beings abandon the perfection of wisdom, and those bodhisattva great beings distance themselves from the perfection of wisdom. 
Subhūti, that is the specific way in which bodhisattva great beings abandon the perfection of wisdom, and the way in which bodhisattva great beings distance themselves from the perfection of wisdom.” 
“Blessed Lord, what are the phenomena in which those who have conviction in the perfection of wisdom do not have conviction?” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “those who have conviction in the perfection of wisdom do not have conviction in physical forms, do not have conviction in feelings, do not have conviction in perceptions, do not have conviction in formative predispositions, and do not have conviction in consciousness;
