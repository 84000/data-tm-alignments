“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why is the purity of the unboundedness of the fearlessnesses because of the unboundedness of the self?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“That is because of the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end,” replied the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, the unboundedness of the kinds of exact knowledge is because of the unboundedness of the self,” said Subhūti. 
“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why is the purity of the unboundedness of the kinds of exact knowledge because of the unboundedness of the self?”

“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why is the purity of the unboundedness of knowledge of all the dharmas because of the unboundedness of the self?” 
asked Subhūti.

“Blessed Lord, the unboundedness of the knowledge of the aspects of the path is because of the unboundedness of the self,” said Subhūti. 
“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why is the purity of the unboundedness of the knowledge of the aspects of the path because of the unboundedness of the self?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“That is because of the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end,” replied the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, the unboundedness of all-aspect omniscience is because of the unboundedness of the self,” said Subhūti. 
“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why is the purity of the unboundedness of all-aspect omniscience because of the unboundedness of the self?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“That is because of the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end,” replied the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, as for such a realization as that, it is the perfection of wisdom of the bodhisattva great beings.” 
“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why is such a realization as that the perfection of wisdom of the bodhisattva great beings?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“That is because of the knowledge of the aspects of the path,” replied the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, if they do not dwell on the near shore, the far shore, or in the middle between the two, it is the perfection of wisdom of the bodhisattva great beings,” said Subhūti. 
“Because of absolute purity, Subhūti,” said the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, why, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, do they not dwell on the near shore, the far shore, or in the middle between the two, and are absolute purity?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“Subhūti, that is because of the sameness of the three times,” replied the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord,” said Subhūti, “the sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas without skillful means perceive this perfection of wisdom by way of apprehending things. 
They undervalue the perfection of wisdom and abandon the perfection of wisdom.” 
“Subhūti, it is so,” said the Blessed One. 
“Excellent, excellent, Subhūti! 
That, Subhūti, is indeed attachment to names and attachment to mental images. 
If you ask why, it is because all phenomena are without mental images and are without names.” 
“Blessed Lord, how are they attached to names and attached to mental images?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “here, if sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas grasp the perfection of wisdom as a name or grasp it as a mental image, then, in grasping the perfection of wisdom as a name or as a mental image, they will be attached to the perfection of wisdom. 
They will undervalue the perfection of wisdom and will abandon the perfection of wisdom. 
Subhūti, if sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas grasp the perfection of wisdom as a mental image, and if, having grasped the perfection of wisdom as a mental image, they give rise to conceits on account of the perfection of wisdom, they are giving rise to conceit on account of the perfection of wisdom and are attached to the perfection of wisdom. 
They will undervalue the perfection of wisdom and will abandon the perfection of wisdom.” 
“Blessed Lord, how wonderful it is that this perfection of wisdom has been eloquently explained and excellently revealed in that manner to bodhisattva great beings, and that they are still attached and unattached to it,” said Subhūti.

“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, in regard to what you also asked, ‘What is the nonattachment of bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom?’ 
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, here bodhisattva great beings with skillful means who practice the perfection of wisdom do not perceive that ‘physical forms are physical forms.’ 
They do not perceive that ‘feelings are feelings.’ 
They do not perceive that ‘perceptions are perceptions.’ 
They do not perceive that ‘formative predispositions are formative predispositions.’ 
And they do not perceive that ‘consciousness is consciousness.’ 
They do not perceive that ‘past phenomena are past phenomena.’ 
They do not perceive that ‘future phenomena are future phenomena.’ 
And they do not perceive that ‘present phenomena are present phenomena.’ 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings with skillful means who practice the perfection of wisdom do not think, ‘I am giving a gift. 
I am giving a gift to them. 
I am giving this sort of gift’; or ‘I am maintaining ethical discipline. 
I am maintaining this sort of ethical discipline’; or ‘I am cultivating tolerance. 
I am cultivating this sort of tolerance’; or ‘I am undertaking perseverance. 
I am undertaking this sort of perseverance’; or ‘I am absorbed in meditative concentration. 
I am absorbed in this sort of meditative concentration’; or ‘I am cultivating wisdom. 
I am cultivating this sort of wisdom,’; or ‘I am making some merit. 
I am making this sort of merit. 
I am making this much merit,’; or ‘I should enter a bodhisattva’s full maturity’; or ‘I should purify a buddhafield;’ or ‘I should bring beings to maturity’; or ‘I should attain all-aspect omniscience.’ 
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, for bodhisattva great beings with skillful means who practice the perfection of wisdom, all such conceptual thoughts are nonexistent and do not come about owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent existence, the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities. 
Venerable Śāradvatīputra, these are the nonattachments of bodhisattva great beings with skillful means who practice the perfection of wisdom.” 
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, asked the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, in what way do sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas become attached?” 
Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, having asked that, the venerable Subhūti replied to him, “Kauśika, when sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas perceive the mind [of enlightenment], perceive the perfection of generosity, perceive the perfection of ethical discipline, perceive the perfection of tolerance, perceive the perfection of perseverance, perceive the perfection of meditative concentration, and perceive the perfection of wisdom; perceive the emptiness of internal phenomena, perceive the emptiness of external phenomena, perceive the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, perceive the emptiness of emptiness, perceive the emptiness of great extent, perceive the emptiness of ultimate reality, perceive the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, perceive the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, perceive the emptiness of the unlimited, perceive the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, perceive the emptiness of nonexclusion, perceive the emptiness of inherent nature, perceive the emptiness of all phenomena, perceive the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, perceive the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, perceive the emptiness of nonentities, perceive the emptiness of essential nature, and perceive the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities; perceive the applications of mindfulness, perceive the correct exertions, perceive the supports for miraculous ability, perceive the faculties, perceive the powers, perceive the branches of enlightenment, and perceive the noble eightfold path; perceive the truths of the noble ones, perceive the meditative concentrations, perceive the immeasurable attitudes, perceive the formless absorptions, perceive the liberations, perceive the serial steps of meditative absorption, perceive the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, perceive the extrasensory powers, perceive the meditative stabilities, perceive the dhāraṇī gateways, perceive the powers of the tathāgatas, perceive the fearlessnesses, perceive the kinds of exact knowledge, perceive great loving kindness, perceive great compassion, and perceive the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas; and when they have a perception of the lord buddhas, and, having perceived the roots of virtue generated on account of those buddhas, gather those roots of virtue and compress them all together and dedicate them, making a dedication to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, and perceive that too––then, Kauśika, these perceptions are the attachment of sons or daughters of good families who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas. 
When those with attachment have become attached, they cannot practice the perfection of wisdom, which is without attachment.

“Moreover Kauśika, when bodhisattva great beings instruct others in, or encourage them in, or fill them with enthusiasm for, or cause them to delight in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, they should instruct others in, they should encourage them in, they should fill them with enthusiasm for, and they should cause them to delight in it with a mind that is in conformity with reality.

Practicing in that manner, sons or daughters of good families should instruct others in, should encourage them in, should fill them with enthusiasm for, and should cause them to delight in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. 
Furthermore, when they instruct others with, encourage them with, fill them with enthusiasm for, and cause them delight with that instruction, that encouragement, that filling with enthusiasm, and that causing delight, they will not degenerate, and they will encourage others with the encouragement permitted by the buddhas. 
In that manner, those sons or daughters of good families will renounce all the limits of attachment.” 
Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Subhūti, “Excellent, Subhūti! 
It is excellent, Subhūti, that you are teaching those sorts of possible attachments, excellent. 
Therefore, Subhūti, I will also explain possible attachments even more subtle than those to you. 
I will teach them, so listen and pay attention very carefully.” 
Saying, “Blessed Lord, I will do so,” the venerable Subhūti then listened to the Blessed One. 
The Blessed One said to him, “Subhūti, when sons or daughters of good families who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment pay attention to the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas as a mental image, to the extent that there is a mental image, to that extent there is attachment. 
“When they pay attention to all the roots of virtue of past, present, and future tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas who are free from all attachments—whatever they are, as many as there are—from the first setting of the mind up to the establishment of the good Dharma, as a mental image, and, having paid attention, dedicate them to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, Subhūti, to the extent they pay attention to a mental image, to that extent there is attachment. 
When they have taken all the roots of virtue of the śrāvakas of those tathāgatas, and of other beings apart from them—whatever they are, as many as there are—as a mental image and dedicate them to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, Subhūti, to the extent they pay attention to a mental image, to that extent there is attachment. 
If you ask why, it is because it is not right to pay attention to those tathāgatas to as a mental image, and it is also not right to pay attention to those roots of virtue of the tathāgatas as a mental image.” 
Then Subhūti said, “Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is profound.” 
“Subhūti, that is because all phenomena are, in their inherent nature, void,” replied the Blessed One. 
“Blessed Lord, I pay homage to the perfection of wisdom,” said Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “because the perfection of wisdom is unfabricated and unconditioned, it cannot be fully awakened to by anyone at all.” 
“Blessed Lord, all phenomena are not fully awakened to.” 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “this is because the inherent nature of phenomena is not two. 
The inherent nature of phenomena is just one. 
Subhūti, that which is the singular inherent nature of phenomena is not the inherent nature of phenomena. 
Subhūti, that which is not the inherent nature is unfabricated. 
That which is unfabricated is unconditioned. 
Subhūti, so it is that when bodhisattva great beings know the singular inherent nature of phenomena that is not the inherent nature—unfabricated and unconditioned—they abandon all possible attachments.” 
“Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is hard to realize,” said Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “this is because the perfection of wisdom has not been seen, has not been heard, has not been realized, has not been cognized, and has not been attained in manifest buddhahood by anyone at all.” 
“Blessed Lord, the perfection of wisdom is inconceivable,” said Subhūti.

“Blessed Lord, it is most wonderful that this profound Dharma is neither diminished when it is explained, nor is it diminished when it is not explained. 
It is neither enhanced when it is explained, nor is it enhanced when it is not explained!” 
“It is so, Subhūti, it is so!”

Subhūti, this is just like illusory persons who are neither enhanced when spoken of in praise, nor diminished when spoken about disparagingly. 
They do not become attached when spoken of in praise, and do not become annoyed when spoken about disparagingly. 
Similarly, Subhūti, with that reality of phenomena as it pertains to phenomena, it is such when it is explained, and it is such even when it is not explained.”

If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because this cultivation of the perfection of wisdom by bodhisattva great beings is like the cultivation of space. 
In space, physical forms are not discerned, feelings are not discerned, perceptions are not discerned, formative predispositions are not discerned, and consciousness is not discerned.

In space, the truths of the noble ones are not discerned, the meditative concentrations are not discerned, the immeasurable attitudes are not discerned, the formless absorptions are not discerned, the eight liberations are not discerned, and the nine serial steps of meditative absorption are not discerned.

In space, the fruit of having entered the stream is not discerned, the fruit of once-returner is not discerned, the fruit of non-returner is not discerned, arhatship is not discerned, individual enlightenment is not discerned, and unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment is not discerned. 
“Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings who have donned this armor are worthy of homage. 
Blessed Lord, those who have donned this armor believe resolutely in striving, believe resolutely in struggling, and believe resolutely in making an effort for the sake of space. 
Blessed Lord, those who don this armor for the sake of beings want to bring space to maturity and want to liberate it. 
“Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings who don this armor for the sake of phenomena that are like space have donned the mighty armor. 
Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings who have donned this armor for the sake of beings want to buttress space with the sky. 
Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment for the sake of beings have acquired the mighty perseverance. 
Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings who have set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment for the welfare of beings have donned the mighty armor. 
Blessed Lord, those bodhisattva great beings who want to fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment for the sake of phenomena that are like space, those heroes, have donned the mighty armor that is inconceivable and unequaled. 
“If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because, if this great billionfold world system were completely filled with many tathāgatas, like a thicket of naḍa reeds, or a thicket of rushes, or a grove of sugarcane, or a thicket of bamboo, or a paddy field of rice, or a field of sesame, and were those tathāgatas for an eon or for even more than an eon to explain the Dharma, and were each of those tathāgatas to bring immeasurable, countless beings to final nirvāṇa, still, a reduction in or filling of the world of beings would not be discerned. 
If you ask why, it is because beings are nonexistent and because beings are void. 
Similarly, if the fields in each of the world systems of the ten directions, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, were completely filled with many tathāgatas like a thicket of naḍa reeds, or a thicket of rushes, or a grove of sugarcane, or a thicket of bamboo, or a paddy field of rice, or a field of sesame, and were those tathāgatas for an eon or for even more than an eon to explain the Dharma, and were each of those tathāgatas to bring immeasurable, countless beings to final nirvāṇa, still, a reduction in or filling of the world of beings would not be discerned. 
If you ask why, it is because beings are nonexistent and because beings are void. 
Blessed Lord, through this round of teaching I say that those who want to fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment for the sake of beings want to bring space to maturity and want to liberate it.” 
Then a certain monk thought, “I pay homage to the blessed lady, the perfection of wisdom, in whom, although no attribute at all arises or ceases, the aggregate of ethical discipline still exists, the aggregate of meditative stability still exists, the aggregate of wisdom still exists, the aggregate of liberation still exists, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation still exists; the fruit of having entering the stream still exists, the fruit of once-returner still exists, the fruit of non-returner still exists, arhatship still exists, individual enlightenment still exists, and unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment still exists; those who have entered the stream still exist, once-returners still exist, non-returners still exist, arhats still exist, pratyekabuddhas still exist, and the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas still exist; and the precious jewel of the Buddha still exists, the precious jewel of the Dharma still exists, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha still exists, and the turnings of the wheel of the Dharma still exist.” 
Then, Śakra, mighty king of the gods, asked the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, if a bodhisattva great being is one of those who are persevering at this profound perfection of wisdom, at what are they persevering?” 
“Kauśika,” replied Subhūti, “those who think that they should train in this perfection of wisdom persevere at empty space.” 
Śakra, mighty king of the gods, then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, I request that you tell me what sort of guarding, protecting, and defending of those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this profound perfection of wisdom I should do.” 
Then the venerable Subhūti asked Śakra, mighty king of the gods, “Kauśika, do you observe any sort of attribute that should be guarded, protected, and defended?” 
“Venerable monk Subhūti, I do not observe any sort of attribute that should be guarded, protected, and defended,” he replied. 
“Kauśika,” Subhūti continued, “if sons or daughters of good families dwell in this perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught, that itself will be their guardian, protection, and defense. 
If they are separated from this perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught, humans or nonhumans looking for an opportunity to inflict harm will find an opportunity to do so. 
You should know that those sons or daughters of good families who do not dwell in this perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught, are separated from the perfection of wisdom. 
“Kauśika, those who think they should guard, protect, and defend bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom think they should guard, protect, and defend space.

When they have trained in it, great and lofty royal families exist, great and lofty priestly families exist, and great and lofty householder families exist; the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm exist, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm exist, the gods of the Yāma realm exist, the gods of the Tuṣita realm exist, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm exist, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm exist; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm exist, the gods of the Brahmapurohita realm exist, the gods of the Brahma­pārṣadya realm exist, and the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm exist; the gods of the Ābha realm exist, the gods of the Parīttābha realm exist, the gods of the Apramāṇābha realm exist, and the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm exist; the gods of the Śubha realm exist, the gods of the Parīttaśubha realm exist, the gods of the Apramāṇaśubha realm exist, and the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm exist; the gods of the Vṛha realm exist, the gods of the Parīttavṛha realm exist, the gods of the Apramāṇavṛha realm exist, and the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm exist; the gods of the Avṛha realm exist, the gods of the Atapa realm exist, the gods of the Sudṛśa realm exist, the gods of the Sudarśana realm exist, and the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm exist; the gods of the sphere of infinite space exist, the gods of the sphere of infinite consciousness exist, the gods of the sphere of nothing-at-all exist, and the gods of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception exist; and those who have entered the stream exist, once-returners exist, non-returners exist, arhats exist, pratyekabuddhas exist, bodhisattvas exist, and the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas exist. 
Therefore, it is called the great jewel perfection. 
“In that great jewel perfection there is no phenomenon at all that arises or ceases, or is defiled or purified, or is taken up or rejected. 
If you ask why, it is because there are no such phenomena that could arise or cease, or be defiled or purified, or be taken up or rejected. 
Subhūti, in this great jewel perfection, virtuous or nonvirtuous, mundane or supramundane, contaminated or uncontaminated, or conditioned or unconditioned phenomena cannot be apprehended at all. 
For this reason, also, Subhūti, this great jewel perfection cannot be apprehended. 
“Subhūti, this great jewel perfection is not sullied by any phenomenon at all. 
If you ask why, it is because such a phenomenon by which it might be sullied cannot be apprehended. 
Therefore, Subhūti, this perfection is a perfection that is unsullied. 
“Subhūti, if, when bodhisattva great beings are practicing the perfection of wisdom, they do not perceive in that manner, do not conceptualize in that manner, do not apprehend in that manner, and do not elaborate in that manner, they are practicing the perfection of wisdom. 
They are cultivating the perfection of wisdom. 
They please the lord buddhas. 
Bringing the lord buddhas directly to mind, they proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield to serve, respect, honor, and worship the lord buddhas. 
They proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield bringing beings to maturity and refining a buddhafield. 
“As for this perfection of wisdom, Subhūti, it does not teach, reveal, disclose, cause to be taken up, make emerge, make arise, make cease, make defiled, make pure, make decline, make increase, or make past, future, or present any phenomenon at all. 
“Subhūti, such a perfection of wisdom as this does not cause you to transcend the realm of desire and does not cause you to stay in it, does not cause you to transcend the realm of form and does not cause you to stay in it, and does not cause you to transcend the realm of formlessness and does not cause you to stay in it. 
“It neither brings about nor prevents the perfection of generosity, neither brings about nor prevents the perfection of ethical discipline, neither brings about nor prevents the perfection of tolerance, neither brings about nor prevents the perfection of perseverance, neither brings about nor prevents the perfection of meditative concentration, and neither brings about nor prevents the perfection of wisdom. 
It neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of internal phenomena, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of external phenomena, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of emptiness, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of great extent, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of ultimate reality, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of the unlimited, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of nonexclusion, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of inherent nature, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of all phenomena, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of nonentities, neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of essential nature, and neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities. 
“It neither brings about nor prevents the applications of mindfulness, neither brings about nor prevents the correct exertions, neither brings about nor prevents the supports for miraculous ability, neither brings about nor prevents the faculties, neither brings about nor prevents the powers, neither brings about nor prevents the branches of enlightenment, and neither brings about nor prevents the noble eightfold path. 
It neither brings about nor prevents the truths of the noble ones, neither brings about nor prevents the meditative concentrations, neither brings about nor prevents the immeasurable attitudes, neither brings about nor prevents the formless absorptions, neither brings about nor prevents the liberations, and neither brings about nor prevents the serial steps of meditative absorption. 
It neither brings about nor prevents the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, neither brings about nor prevents the extrasensory powers, neither brings about nor prevents the meditative stabilities, and neither brings about nor prevents the dhāraṇī gateways. 
It neither brings about nor prevents the powers of the tathāgatas, neither brings about nor prevents the fearlessnesses, neither brings about nor prevents the kinds of exact knowledge, neither brings about nor prevents great loving kindness, neither brings about nor prevents great compassion, and neither brings about nor prevents the distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
It neither brings about nor prevents the fruit of having entered the stream, neither brings about nor prevents the fruit of once-returner, neither brings about nor prevents the fruit of non-returner, neither brings about nor prevents arhatship, neither brings about nor prevents individual enlightenment, neither brings about nor prevents the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and neither brings about nor prevents all-aspect omniscience. 
“This perfection of wisdom neither prevents the conditioned element, nor brings about the unconditioned element. 
“If you ask why, it is because, whether the tathāgatas appear or whether the tathāgatas do not appear, the reality of phenomena as it pertains to phenomena, the realm of phenomena, the abiding nature of phenomena, the maturity of phenomena remains just as it is. 
It is the full awakening attained by the tathāgatas and comprehended by them. 
Having fully awakened, having completely comprehended it; they also describe, teach, explain, analyze, and elucidate it.” 
Then many thousands of gods, positioning themselves in the sky above, cheered long and loud. 
They scattered divine flowers—blue lotuses, day lotuses, red lotuses, white lotuses, mandārava flowers, and big mandārava flowers—and they exclaimed, “Ah! 
Through the teaching of this perfection of wisdom many thousands of gods have gained acceptance that phenomena are nonarising. 
We are seeing the wheel of the Dharma being turned for the second time in Jambudvīpa!” 
Then the Blessed One addressed the elder Subhūti: “Subhūti, owing to the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities, this is not the first, nor is it the second turning of the wheel of the Dharma. 
This perfection of wisdom has not been established for any Dharma to be turned or not turned.” 
“Blessed Lord, what is the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities, owing to which this perfection of wisdom is not established as any Dharma to be turned or not turned?” 
asked Subhūti. 
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “the perfection of wisdom is empty of the perfection of wisdom, the perfection of meditative concentration is empty of the perfection of meditative concentration, the perfection of perseverance is empty of the perfection of perseverance, the perfection of tolerance is empty of the perfection of tolerance, the perfection of ethical discipline is empty of the perfection of ethical discipline, and perfection of generosity is empty of the perfection of generosity. 
“The emptiness of internal phenomena is empty of the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena is empty of the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena empty of the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness is empty of the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent is empty of the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality is empty of the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena is empty of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena, the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena is empty of the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the unlimited is empty of the emptiness of the unlimited, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is empty of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of nonexclusion is empty of the emptiness of nonexclusion, the emptiness of inherent nature is empty of the emptiness of inherent nature, the emptiness of all phenomena is empty of the emptiness of all phenomena, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics is empty of the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended is empty of the emptiness of that which cannot be apprehended, the emptiness of nonentities is empty of the emptiness of nonentities, the emptiness of essential nature is empty of the emptiness of essential nature, and the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities is empty of the emptiness of an essential nature of nonentities. 
“The applications of mindfulness are empty of the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions are empty of the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability are empty of the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties are empty of the faculties, the powers are empty of the powers, the branches of enlightenment are empty of the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path is empty of the noble eightfold path. 
“The truths of the noble ones are empty of the truths of the noble ones, the meditative concentrations are empty of the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable attitudes are empty of the immeasurable attitudes, the formless absorptions are empty of the formless absorptions, the liberations are empty of the liberations, the serial steps of meditative absorption are empty of the serial steps of meditative absorption, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation are empty of the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the extrasensory powers are empty of the extrasensory powers, the meditative stabilities are empty of the meditative stabilities, and the dhāraṇī gateways are empty of the dhāraṇī gateways. 
The powers of the tathāgatas are empty of the powers of the tathāgatas, the fearlessnesses are empty of the fearlessnesses, the kinds of exact knowledge are empty of the kinds of exact knowledge, great loving kindness is empty of great loving kindness, great compassion is empty of great compassion, and the distinct qualities of the buddhas are empty of the distinct qualities of the buddhas. 
The fruit of having entered the stream is empty of the fruit of having entered the stream, the fruit of once-returner is empty of the fruit of once-returner, the fruit of non-returner is empty of the fruit of non-returner, arhatship is empty of arhatship, individual enlightenment is empty of individual enlightenment, the knowledge of the aspects of the path is empty of the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and all-aspect omniscience is empty of all-aspect omniscience.” 
“Blessed Lord, this perfection of wisdom of the bodhisattva great beings is great, because the perfection of wisdom is empty of its own essential nature. 
It is all phenomena empty of all phenomena. 
Even though bodhisattva great beings dwell in the perfection of wisdom and will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, they do not fully awaken to any Dharma at all. 
Even though they turn the wheel of the Dharma, they do not cause any Dharma to turn, not to turn, or to further turn. 
They neither see nor do not see any Dharma. 
If you ask why, it is because the sort of Dharma that is turned, is not turned, or further turns cannot be apprehended; it is because all Dharmas have not been brought into being at all. 
If you ask why, it is because emptiness does not cause turning or cause not turning. 
Signlessness does not cause turning or cause not turning. 
And wishlessness does not cause turning or cause not turning. 
“The teaching, explanation, proclamation, establishment, exposition, analysis, interpretation, discussion, elucidation, and revelation of the perfection of wisdom in this manner is the utterly purified teaching of the perfection of wisdom. 
Nobody has explained this teaching of the perfection of wisdom, nor has anybody grasped it. 
That which nobody has explained and nobody has grasped has not been actualized by anybody; and where nobody has directly actualized it, there nobody has passed into final nirvāṇa. 
Nor is there anyone at all who is worthy of offerings on account of this exposition of the Dharma.” 
This completes the twenty-eighth chapter from “The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines.”
