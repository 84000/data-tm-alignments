The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
The Good Eon
Chapter 1
 Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Śrāvasti, where he had observed the summer retreat. After the three months of summer had passed, he prepared his Dharma robes. Once he had prepared his Dharma robes, he put on the robes, took up his alms bowl, and, together with one hundred thousand monks and eight hundred million bodhisattvas, proceeded toward the city of Vaiśālī. On the way, the Blessed One entered a large forest, where he later arose from meditative seclusion.
The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja,  who had also entered meditative seclusion, now likewise reemerged from this state. He and the whole assembly of monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahorāgas were now seated on their mats. All of the assembled bodhisattvas had attained illumination, dhāraṇī, and absorption. They were endowed with the five superknowledges, their words were engaging, and they were free from pretense, had no worldly ambitions, and were free from attachment. They taught the Dharma without any regard for material things. They had perfected acceptance of the profound Dharma, had accomplished fearlessness, and were beyond the actions of the māras. They had shed karmic obscurations, achieved the state free from any doubt about the nature of the Dharma, and accumulated aspirations throughout countless eons. They had smiles on their faces, spoke straightforwardly, and never frowned. They communicated in melodious voices, their minds were indomitable, and the flow of their eloquence was unbroken. They had achieved acceptance of equality. They were able to outshine infinite gatherings without any fear. They were adept at elaborating on a single word throughout ten million eons.
They were confident that all phenomena are just like illusions, a mirage, the moon in water, dreams, and echoes. Their minds were endowed with infinite fearlessness, and they were confident in knowing the most subtle movements in the minds of sentient beings, as well as every aspect of their conduct. They possessed vast virtue  and their minds were unimpeded. They were free from exaggerating pride and endowed with patience. Their virtues were genuinely comprehensive. Their aspirations encompassed infinite arrays of buddha realms. They constantly manifested the absorption of recollecting the buddhas of countless world systems. They were skilled in supplicating boundless buddhas. They were skilled in quelling differing views, as well as latent tendencies and the fetters of emotional defilements. They were skilled in accomplishing hundreds of thousands of displays through absorption. They included the bodhisattva Maitreya, as well as the youthful Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Sound of Thunder, Mind of Blooming Flowers of a Hundred Thousand Virtues, Possessor of the Mind of Infinite Practice and the Speech That Is Adorned with Flashes of Lightning, Possessor of the Mind of Complete Detachment, King of Renown, Perceiver of the Agreeable and the Disagreeable, King of the Splendid Light of Deep Accumulations of Gold, Seeing and Moving Across a Hundred Yojanas, Heaps of Eloquence, Mass of Wisdom, Amoghadarśin, Bhadrapāla, the Eight Holy Beings, Gandhahastin, Jewel Treasury, Heaps of Insight, Array of Offerings, King of the Melodious Lion’s Roar, Adorned with Arrays of Wisdom, Moving with the Gait of a Lion, Fearless in Limitless Mastery of Eloquence, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, and others.
From the world systems of the great trichiliocosm came the Four Great Kings, Śakra, Brahmā, Īśvara, Mahābrahmā,  nāga leaders, yakṣa leaders, asura leaders, garuḍa leaders, kinnara leaders, mahorāga leaders, and gandharva leaders, arriving in the presence of the Blessed One, scattering flowers before him, and then taking their places in the gathering. 
 At that time, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja observed seven days of fasting during which he would either stand or sit upright, practicing with unrelenting diligence, free from drowsiness and without sleep. It was then that the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke to the Blessed One: “Which quality must bodhisattvas perfect in order for them to know the thoughts and conduct of all sentient beings, to apply the words that have the intent of all the buddhas, to avoid teaching based on incorrect teachings, to follow knowledge grounded in truth as literally expressed, and to become free of any obscuration with respect to all the buddhas of the present? Through which quality may they be able to accompany and perceive the buddhas, achieve certainty through the Dharma, follow the ways of the world without becoming stained by the world, abide in meditative attainments without taking birth in the corresponding realms, practice the Dharma of nirvāṇa without transcending suffering, and practice the Dharma of hearers and solitary buddhas in which the aspirations of buddhahood are not perfected, without achieving deliverance through those vehicles? Through which quality may their minds be unclouded in recollecting the buddhas, may they engage with the different dispositions and also be in accord with them all, not become overpowered by any question or eloquence,  apprehend all the infinite displays of the buddha realms, attain all forms of insight, bring sentient beings to maturation without adhering to the notion of ‘sentient being,’ teach the Dharma yet not fixate on any objective references, explain nirvāṇa yet not objectify this peacefulness in any way, act for the sake of awakening without fixation, and give up existence, as well as no existence, but aspire to what is vast? Blessed One, I do not ask in this way without any knowledge. Nevertheless, please explain.” 
Then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke these verses:
“A large assembly of gods, humans, yakṣas, and gandharvas 
Have gathered here in accordance with their infinite aspirations.
What is the practice of the bodhisattvas?
You are the protector of the worlds, the Illuminator,
“Moon of Speech—as I beseech you,
Please give the teaching in step-by-step fashion.
When common people hear of the qualities of supreme awakening,
They become inspired and endeavor for awakening.
“With faith in the supreme qualities of awakening,
I ask you who have perfected all good qualities. 
Master of infinite renown, do you know my mind?
Other than the Victorious One, who could be my witness?
“Gods and humans are thirsting for the qualities of the victorious ones.
Please explain, delineating the practices of the ten powers.
You possess the supreme qualities and have the qualities of awakening.
You who know the great ways of renown and beauty, please explain!
“How do the brilliant light rays of wisdom 
Conquer the forces of darkness and their armies?
How is the trichiliocosm quickly shaken?
Well-Gone One, please explain about such activities of awakening.
“How does the flower of the buddha marks blossom? 
How does one come to possess an infinite voice? 
How does the absorption that resembles Sumeru arise?
Please explain such practices of the mind of awakening. 
“Incomparable and unrivaled, you are without guile or pretense,
Selfless, worthy, and free from contamination of the three stains.
You are the supreme mendicant praised by throngs of the learned—
I ask you about the practices of supreme people.
“Your understanding is stable and mindful, and you have the flower of speech.
Unconfused, you master excellent conduct and are the best of orators.
Good person free from stains, supreme leader and benefactor,
Please teach me how to become victorious.
“When I have heard these matters from you,
I shall pursue the true practices of awakening throughout day and night.
Without anything else occupying my mind,
I shall joyfully devote myself fully to these practices.
“How does one possess absorption and dhāraṇī?
How does one possess wisdom, insight, and eloquence?
How is one able to behold buddhas in infinite directions,
And to ask questions regarding what is right and what is not?
“How is unequaled wisdom realized?
How are the hundreds of avenues of virtue accomplished?
And how does the teaching become free from error?
This I ask of you, who practices the ten powers.
“I ask not out of attachment to the pleasures of existence,
Or because I am swayed by objects.
I cherish the elixir of the victorious ones.
So please, quickly, teach me about the practice of the ten powers!”
The Blessed One then spoke to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Excellent, Prāmodyarāja, excellent! I possess the absorption called elucidating the way of all phenomena. When bodhisattvas possess that absorption, they attain those qualities. Furthermore, they perfect one hundred and twenty-one perfections. They attain eighty-four thousand absorptions and eighty-four thousand dhāraṇīs. They realize expert ways of engaging in the conduct of all sentient beings,  and they quickly awaken to unexcelled, complete, and perfect buddhahood.
 “Prāmodyarāja, what is the absorption called elucidating the way of all phenomena? It is doing exactly what one says. It is saying exactly what one has done. It is purifying the body, purifying the speech, and purifying the mind. It is the wish to benefit. It is being endowed with love, not relinquishing compassion, not pursuing pleasures, pursuing the Dharma, ensuring that faith is not wasted, and practicing in accordance with one’s pledges. It is being expert regarding language. It is liberating sentient beings, practicing well-considered deeds, not having bodily cravings, and having an unwavering mind.

It is giving up lack of faith, being highly motivated, setting one’s mind on buddhas, teaching flourishing, rejoicing in merits, supplicating the buddhas, paying homage to those worthy of offerings,  and expressing praise. 
“It is being free from pride, being insatiable regarding roots of virtue, being constantly diligent, not giving up on one’s pursuits but ensuring their completion, being magnanimous in the world with respect to deeds performed according to causes and conditions, and not forsaking the requisites. It is not postulating a single metaphysical ground and not clinging to the idea that ‘this alone is true.’ It is never calling the desire realm ‘home,’ not clinging to the form realm, not being of the nature of the formless realm, and having firm conviction about how results manifest in accordance with their conditioning. It is sharing one’s own means and being impartial, never tricking any being, not being deceptive regarding the buddhas, not disparaging bodhisattvas, and not speaking badly about the teachings. 
“It is harboring no anger toward the rational or irrational, not relying on the wealth of other groups, never failing to fulfill wishes, giving up pride, giving up anger, and conquering ignorance. It is not enjoying wealth, being content with bare necessities, abandoning worldly pursuits, not being displeased with not getting wealth, not becoming conceited at getting wealth, sharing whatever one obtains, and not hoarding. It is accepting negative words from others, guarding one’s words, being clear minded, encouraging those who are rational, not following those who are irrational, and practicing sustained inquiry. It is not giving up meditative seclusion, not leaving the wilderness, always practicing the ascetic virtues, being inspired by emptiness, not being satisfied with things, not fixating on the aggregates, subduing the elements, not reifying the sense sources,  not revering objects, giving up error, attaining mental stability, abiding in the abodes of the noble ones, having a mind free from craving and yearning, attaining the level of being worthy of offerings, and completely purifying karmic conditioning. 
“It is generosity whereby you do not take on karmic ripening, it is discipline whereby you have no arrogance, it is patience whereby you have no divisive thoughts, it is diligence in which your efforts are not squandered, it is concentration whereby you do not take rebirth, and it is insight whereby you do not squander life. It is equality as the perfection of progressing in the spiritual levels. It is not being conceited about one’s own qualities and not denigrating the good qualities of others. It is not remaining in saṃsāra, not objectifying nirvāṇa, mastering liberation, not being attached to nirvāṇa, and resting in certainty. It is having a smile on one’s face, not having an angry frown, and speaking with sincerity. It is praising novices, midlevel practitioners, and seniors due to their proper understanding. It is being free from animosity, pacifying disputes, praising peace, endeavoring in the accumulations, and having equal concern for those who are one’s friends and those who are not one’s friends. 
“It is pursuing dhāraṇī. It is respectfully serving all beings as if they were one’s mother, respectfully serving all wise ones as if they were one’s father, respectfully serving all masters as if they were one’s own preceptor, venerating the bodhisattvas as if they were buddhas, worshiping the thus-gone ones, aspiring to virtue, and untiringly venerating the Three Jewels. It is joyfully persevering without being involved in worldly affairs, not having concern for the body, not being attached to one’s own life, maintaining a pure livelihood, not giving up the practice of making alms rounds, abandoning places where people gather,  not praising householders, and not conducting business among those who have gone forth. It is having no hypocrisy, not engaging in flattery, speaking pleasantly, adhering to the practices of awakening, being naturally undaunted, and engaging in what is appropriate. It is offering continuous praise for the Buddha, always being attentive to the Dharma, and always following the Saṅgha. It is constantly worshiping those endowed with knowledge, always relying on those who are erudite, always guarding those in meditation, always exhorting those endowed with reason, always relying on the teachings of the buddhas, always cultivating the Dharma teachings, always trusting in merit, always being generous to sentient beings, always caring for those who have faith, and bringing relief to those who suffer.
“It is having pure conduct, knowing shame and modesty, having a manner that demonstrates shame and fear, giving up unwholesome conduct, attending to proper conduct, and being inclined toward renunciation. It is seeking out the abodes of the noble ones, cultivating the applications of mindfulness, relying on the correct abandonments, taking hold of the faculties, accomplishing the powers, having special insight into the factors of awakening, and being unerring on the path. It is possessing vast calm abiding, rousing special insight, being free from forgetfulness, and having genuine joy in the Dharma. It is going beyond objective references, not fearing the lack of support, and not confusing the absence of objective references with carelessness. It is abiding by the conduct of the bodhisattvas, engaging in the infinite conduct of the buddhas, having scorn for unwholesome conduct,  being saddened by past karmic formations, purifying one’s own karma, and taking charge of what has not yet been tamed.
“It is never disparaging the teachings, not harboring doubts, acting in timely ways, giving up what is not timely, having skill in going and returning, knowing limits, being content regarding material things, having vast superknowledge, mastering absorption, having diverse modes of conduct, and having vast courage. It is the teachings of the thus-gone ones, being fully receptive through nonapprehension, satisfying the diligent, cultivation by the children of the buddhas, the wealth of the bodhisattvas, the abiding of the buddhas, and the practice of the learned, the domain of intelligent progress, and the domain of the teachers of the Dharma. It is inspiration for the highly motivated, the disposition to behold the protectors of the three worlds, a treasury for those in pursuit of wealth, and a field of those endowed with ripening. It is true happiness for the tormented, a park for those who have achieved dhāraṇī, a pool for those who have attained absorption, a mother for those endowed with virtuous qualities, a support for those inspired by speech, the cause of the major marks of the buddhas, the discernment of the minor marks, and the refuge of the buddha realms. It is the full attainment of dhāraṇī, mastery of attainment, and perfectly reasonable speech. 
“It is transcendence of the realm of the māras, the realm of heroes, conquering the emotional defilements, demolishing unvirtuous actions, the adornment of those with aspirations, and invulnerability to the māras. It is the inexhaustible teachings, what is hard to fathom for non-Buddhist sectarians, what is dissimilar to the world, what transcends the Dharma of the hearers, and what is not the deliverance of the solitary buddhas. It is attaining omniscience,  entering the existences of sentient beings, and inspiration for the ultimate state of reality. It is delighting those wishing for food, and satisfying those thirsting for drink. It is the essence of those who attain nirvāṇa, the chariot of those who attain nirvāṇa, the boat for sailing to the other shore, the boat for those wishing to cross, the lamp for the compassionate, the shooting star for the teachers of Dharma, the abode of those wishing for freedom from deception, wealth for those wishing to give, knowledge for those wishing for liberation, ennoblement for those in pursuit of amusements, an ocean for those wishing to learn, Mount Sumeru for those who accomplish absorption, a sense faculty for those who desire eyes, a display for those wishing to see, delight for those endowed with mind, the abode of nonregression, and the intention of those who have attained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. 
“It is the cultivation of beginners, the banner of people with understanding, the awakening of those who revere calm abiding, and the Nārāyaṇa of those who teach the absence of self. It is the path of omniscience, the equality of birth for those with wisdom and liberation, what is praised by the gods, what is extolled by the nāgas, what is worshiped by humans, what inspires wonder in those in training, what is revered by those beyond training, what is applauded by the bodhisattvas, and what is cultivated by the lords of Dharma. It is the city of those who guard their faculties, the way of skillful ones, the attainment of the diligent, the dispelling of doubts, cutting through doubts, dispelling the defilements, and the dhāraṇīs of the bodhisattvas. It is a doctor for the sick, a remedy for error, and a reliever of pain. It is the contemplation for those wishing to persevere,  fearlessness for those wishing to proclaim, vast and genuine knowledge for those wishing to speak, miraculous abilities for those wishing to perform miracles, a journey for those wishing to hear, eyes for those wishing to see, the path to nirvāṇa, relinquishing the lower realms, transcending the realms of desire, form, and formlessness, and accomplishing the realms of the buddhas. 
“It is embracing the vajra-like absorption, the lion throne for those in their final existence, the roots of virtue for those who pursue nondegeneracy, giving joy to the sad, uplifting the downtrodden, fortifying the diligent, and accomplishing the dispositions of conduct. It is contemplation for the idle, the declaration of the equality of the three vehicles, abandoning all grasping, perfecting omniscience, thoroughly attaining the infinite gateways of those who teach the ultimate, ensuring that the qualities of the teaching of emptiness are not wasted, and perfecting the strength of the gateways of aspiration. It is communication for those who are inspired toward the absence of marks, the equality of the three times for those who are inspired toward seeing and equanimity, skill in universal outreach, and teaching awakening. It is not being vulnerable to denigration by others. 
“It is the Dharma teachers’ pursuit of freedom from delusion, following Dharma teachers who are free of materialistic concerns, and listening to the Dharma without distraction. It is the unblemished retinue, the absence of obstacles for giving the Dharma, causing amazement in those who ask questions with conviction, dispelling regret, continuous engagement, not abandoning the accumulation of wisdom, the liberation of those who grasp, the taming of those who are offensive, and shedding the defilements. It is practicing without supports,  being mindful of those wishing for mindfulness, uplifting the bodhisattvas, teaching the fourfold retinue, and the sweetest among delicious tastes. It is a declaration for those wishing for miraculous abilities, an open door for those wishing to turn back from existence, the liberation in nirvāṇa, a blissful body, a blissful mind, the joy of the wise, the nonabdication of firm commitments, and the undeterred attainment of the qualities of the thus-gone ones. 
“It is the abode of the roots of virtue, the destruction of nonvirtue, training for those with misguided intelligence, the abode of those adhering to reason, the nondeceptive guide, the attainment of the light of the buddhas, the light of the mass of wisdom, and displaying the realms of the buddhas. It is the posing of millions of questions, thinking of virtuous qualities, a focal point for the weary, not forsaking those of poor intelligence, and delighting the knowledgeable. It is the cause of action for those wishing to teach, the protector of those who teach the Dharma, knowledge of all causes, and skill in means regarding all phenomena. It is accomplishing the means for contemplation, seeing in accord with reality, conveying meaning to oneself, truly satisfying others, cutting through the mesh, and dispelling ignorance. It is understanding the aggregates, understanding consciousness, comprehending name and form, seeing the six sense sources, understanding contact, knowing sensation, quelling craving, giving up grasping, halting becoming, uprooting birth, and transcending old age and death. It is the purification of suffering, rejoicing in happiness, dispelling suffering and unhappiness, attaining the accomplishments,  satisfying the discerning, flawless light, and proclamations in accord with the Dharma. It is the power of beings who have gained fame, the cleansing of those who are stained, and overcoming the view that takes the aggregates to be a person. 
“It is retaining what is heard and retaining the teachings of the Dharma. It is unmistaken awakening, unceasing engagement with virtuous factors, vast accumulations of virtue, the basis for attaining wisdom, the Dharma way of the diligent, expanding the saṅgha of noble beings, eliminating the criticism of others, approving of those who teach the Dharma, and the conduct of bodhisattvas. It is the moon for those wishing to play, the sun for those who pursue livelihood, the treatise for those wishing to train, the king of those who are respected, the guide of the learned, the seed of virtuous factors, the nectar of the ripened fruit, the basis for recollecting births, the attainment of birth, contempt for childish teachings, the authentic qualities of the teachings of the thus-gone ones, and the infinite ripening of those who teach and uphold the Dharma. It is a foundation of omniscience, attainment of the higher realms in teaching, abandoning all fears in posing questions, never turning back when crossing over, and a foundation for expressing realization. It is letting the entire world ponder the Dharma, the words of all the buddhas of the past, the treasure of the wisdom of all the buddhas of the present, and the perfection of the realization of all the buddhas of the future.
“It is quickly attaining unshakable true wisdom, the seal that emerges from the Buddha’s hand, and the insatiability of those who wish to ask about the Buddhadharma. It is the quelling of aggressive cognitions,  the attainment of skillful means, cultivating the earth element, engaging with the water element, balancing the fire element, stabilizing the wind element, and attaining liberation in the space element. It is revealing the element of consciousness, dissatisfaction with conditioned factors, bringing an end to latent tendencies, dispelling anger, letting go in equanimity, skill regarding one’s own support, skill regarding the support of others, and words for those wishing to speak. It is freedom from clinging to accomplishments, relinquishing the idea of ‘I,’ relinquishing the idea of ‘mine,’ the basis for reversing inclinations, a cautious mind, attending to the mind like a guard dog, entering the vast, and comprehending the subtle.
“It is shade for the weary, traversing the river, being indomitable when under attack, the staff of good people, veneration for spiritual teachers, giving up dullness and sleep, going beyond agitation, giving up doubt, dispelling the wish for pleasure, and giving up laziness. It is not observing a self, not propounding the existence of a sentient being, not fixating on a life force, being free from forgetfulness regarding the Dharma, speaking flawless words, speaking with reason, properly contemplating the process of formation, the essence of mastery, the essence of being undeterred, inspiration toward generosity and wisdom, entering the retinue without timidity, not disparaging others, not proclaiming one’s own qualities, and constant commitment for the sake of awakening. It is diligent engagement, not staying for long in any location, giving up grasping, engaging in auspicious activities, not being of the body, an undaunted mind,  expertise regarding the supports, cultivating recollection, being unswerving and free from pride, pursuing liberation, the resolution of doubt, taking birth in the pure abodes, the mind of equal love, the compassionate embrace, the joyous experience of appreciating oneself, dispelling attachment and anger within impartiality, accepting others through discipline, entering the attainment of absorption, and entering the liberation of all factors through insight. It is understanding the use of syllables, skill in etymology, mastering expressions, engaging with language, pursuit of the essence of expertise, and expressing the gift of Dharma without vested desires. It is having no zeal for single-minded certainty, not growing tired of a single approach, neither accepting nor rejecting what concerns awakening, not squandering any dharma, teaching correctly, and not deceiving any sentient being. It is the perfection of stable aspiration, continuous engagement throughout day and night, the conduct of the bodhisattvas, entering the realms of sentient beings, and accomplishing omniscience. Prāmodyarāja, this is the absorption that is known as elucidating the way of all phenomena.”
At that time, the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“The path of the noble ones that purifies conduct,
The way of harmony that refines the mind,
And the way of the branches of awakening, the essence of eloquence—
This absorption is the treasure of the well-gone ones.
“Stainless subduer of the māras that alone eliminates anger,
Insight that severs the craving for existence, 
Perfectly granting the qualities of fame and renown,
Final deliverance from the three realms,
“It is the ground of wisdom and is also the path of virtue. 
It is the family of the noble ones, the destroyer of māras,
The liberator from existence, praised by the well-gone ones—
This absorption is the wealth of the well-gone ones.
“The gate to ten million ways of entering perfect equality,
The source of understanding, satisfaction, and severance,
Destroyer of suffering and harbinger of happiness—
This absorption is the conduct of the well-gone ones.
“Making us recollect and understand the flower of the branches of awakening;
Amassing virtue, the excellent foundation, with a sense of modesty;
Delighting the well-gone ones with garlands of the branches of awakening—
This is the supreme absorption that is taught.
“Garland of the branches of awakening, liberation;
Conqueror of birth, culminating in the buddhafields;
Granter of moonlight, illuminator, beyond the three realms—
This supreme Dharma is praised by the moon.
“Giving up distractions, pretenses, and the worldly aims,
Adhering to a forest retreat,
And purifying the three modes of engagement—
Thus, one shall attain this absorption.
“Having relinquished the causes of attachments to others, deception, and profiteering,
You do not proclaim your own qualities.
May you don the three Dharma robes and live as a mendicant.
Thereby you will not engage in hoarding wealth.
“Maintain the cheerful character of the noble ones,
And if you wish to quickly attain absorption,
Be wise and always ask questions.
Once you have asked, you should also adhere to realization.
“Remaining far from gatherings and enjoying calm abiding,
Being a caring friend to all beings,
And always giving up fame, the basis for hypocrisy,
You should pursue this peaceful absorption.
“Dress in modesty and savor the food of solitude.
Resting in concentration within your home in solitude,
If you take constant joy in the realization of selflessness,
You will not wish for the pleasures of other experts.
“If you wish to quickly attain this absorption,
Be patient when others speak with anger,
Do not develop pride, let go of the sense of ‘I,’
And have firm faith in the ripening of karma. 
“Without adhering to the paths and situations of the lower realms,
And without adhering to places devoid of noble beings,
Give rise to the power of diligence throughout day and night.
Thus, you must obtain this absorption—there is no other way.
“Free from the unattractive paths of the two extremes,
This true way is a path of equality. 
Whoever sees this uncreated and unborn Dharma
Will delight the buddhas with their accomplishment.
“Prāmodyarāja, such is the absorption known as elucidating the way of all phenomena. Bodhisattvas who attain it comprehend all phenomena without error. They realize that all phenomena are unsupported. They realize all phenomena to be unborn. They realize all phenomena of the buddhas to be uncreated. They realize all phenomena to be hollow. They realize all phenomena to be fake. They realize all phenomena to be devoid of any essence. They become indomitable. They go beyond the five realms of wandering beings. They defeat the māras. They bring joy to all sentient beings. They receive the veneration of all the learned. They behold the whole nature of reality. They shine brightly like the moon. They know the movements in the minds of all sentient beings. They inspire everyone with pure intention. They know the whole trichiliocosm. They attain the level of devoted conduct. 
“They delve into selflessness. They comprehend the elements that are to be left behind. They attain the spiritual level that transcends the arrogating pride of all sentient beings. They transcend obscuration. They comprehend the nature of name and form. They reflect on the teaching of the buddhas in terms of creative etymologies. They attain the thirty-two marks. They are unaffected by acquisition and lack of acquisition. They are unpolluted within the world. They are a support for all sentient beings. They open the door to nirvāṇa.  They are donors. They reveal deathlessness. They comprehend nirvāṇa. They dispel the torments of sentient beings. They cut through the doubts of sentient beings. They are not adulterated by the six faculties. They attain the dhāraṇī of engaging in the sixteen syllables. What are the sixteen syllables they attain the dhāraṇī of engaging in? They are a, ra, pa, ca, na, da, sa, ka, tha, pa, ba, kṣa, cha, pa, ṭha, and ḍha. By means of the dhāraṇī of engaging in these sixteen, they attain the spiritual level of accomplishment in infinite ways.
“They comprehend the voidness of all phenomena. They gain certainty. They develop knowledge of the intentions of all sentient beings. In this way, all emotional defilements cease to exist. They understand the true nature of everything grasped by immature beings. They make headway. They satisfy all sentient beings. They offer worship by means of excellent speech. They provide the offering of deathlessness. They know all the deeds of the buddhas. They attain full knowledge. They cut through doubts in themselves and others. They are always eager to dispel the regrets of sentient beings. They obtain the melodious voice of the kalaviṅka bird. They gain attainment through equality. They bring forth the lion’s roar. They are sincere. They practice the perfection of patience and perfect great compassion. They go beyond the sphere of the māras. They perfect the melodious voice. 
“They achieve acceptance by having given up pride. They possess profound concentration. They teach the Dharma that conquers the world. They achieve depth.  They attain great strength and power with respect to all phenomena. They are full of knowledge, for they know in terms of all phenomena. They are mindful of the conduct of all sentient beings. Over countless eons they comprehend all things just as they are. They know all attacks. They attain the relinquishment of all thoughts of weariness. They quickly attain awakening. They are praised by the gods. They attend to all phenomena by means of knowledge. They are skilled in the achievement of meaningful objectives. All phenomena appear as they truly are to them. They partake of elixir as their food. 
“They cut through all doubts. They discard all connections created by habitual tendencies. They are enveloped by great compassion. They recollect the true intent. They cultivate recollections of past lives. They swiftly comprehend the activities associated with the qualities of nirvāṇa. They attain the level of being worshiped by great gatherings. They destroy all pride. They accomplish the level of power. They engage with the manifold. They know accomplishment. They know all ripening. They expand the realms of the buddhas. They conquer the māra of the aggregates. They quickly comprehend the teaching of realization. Thereby, they quickly destroy the māras. They quickly subdue the attacks of others. They see buddhas in innumerable realms of the world. They also listen to their Dharma. They do not forget the sacred Dharma. They accomplish the perfection of reveling in absorption according to will. Thus, as the bodhisattvas who attain this absorption are careful, they should be declared omniscient. Why is that? Because, depending entirely on their wishes, they may within just one single life, or within two lives, or three lives, or four, or after eons, awaken to perfect buddhahood. And why is that? Because this absorption is omniscience.”
Then the Blessed One spoke these verses: 
“Those who uphold this way of practicing the ten powers
Are free from delusion, unshakable, and unparalleled.
They attain the nectar of immortality and strive,
With matchless glory, in the realms of gods and humans.
“Those who uphold these ways of praise through the ten powers
Bring joy in overcoming the dirt and sod of the defilements,
And delight gods and humans with clear words.
Worthy of the qualities of the victors, they dispel the darkness of existence.
“Those who engage in this practice to attain the ten powers
Destroy the lower realms and are expert about the lower realms.
They dispel the unwholesome orientations of gods and humans and bring them joy.
They are wise path masters who discern the conduct of others.
“Engaging in this practice, they relinquish the vast realms of existence
And inspire the mistaken who have strayed there.
While they act in accordance with the wishes of gods and humans,
Such beings of power bring them vision, like unshrouded moons.
“This practice is unequaled and gives constant joy to gods and humans.
The wise who are displeased with the realms of existence, 
Yet not confused by objects,
Reveal to their retinues hundreds of ways of proclaiming the teachings.
“Those who obtain the nectar from the city of the victors’ qualities,
Such benefactors who adopt it and reveal it,
Attain the thirty-two marks of beauty
And bring joy to gods and humans. 
“This practice dispels the barbarian hordes.
It subdues myriad beings and reveals magnificent qualities.
With swift skill regarding the māras, objects, and existences,
You are a supreme mendicant, praised by gods and humans for your qualities.
“If you wish to attain the supreme wealth of immortality,
Then engage in this practice and you will soon be victorious.
With the sweet fragrance of the renowned, supreme qualities, 
You will free gods and humans from fear and peacefully liberate their cities.
“Those who practice in this way find joy in immortality.
Applying themselves correctly, they praise the well-gone ones of the ten directions.
They deliver discourses and delight gods and humans.
They beautifully explain the way of benefiting, taming, and achieving equipoise.
“Helping the gods and asuras who live on earth reach nirvāṇa,
And destroying the armies of the māras,
They have come to worship the victors and are skilled in states of existence. 
With mindfulness they abandon existence and have qualities of expert understanding.
“When you apprehend the supreme peace of this absorption,
Your faculties will be serene, you will embrace supreme wisdom,
And you will practice the conduct of a rhinoceros and be free from grasping a self.
This is the ever-blazing comet of the Dharma.
“Those who teach this ocean of wisdom
Realize the momentary nature of things.
In the three realms they are like lofty parasols,
Receiving the praises of the kings of the gods. 
“Those who exert themselves in this peace that is hard to find
Dispel the painful emotional defilements.
In the worlds of the well-gone ones they explain cessation,
Interrupting the defilements and taming the three realms.
“Those who attain this supreme absorption 
Are mindful of the conduct of others but also attend to their own deeds.
They develop abundant knowledge of the well-gone ones’ wisdom,
And adhere to it in all its aspects. 
“Those who accomplish this belong to the family of the buddhas,
Perfecting many millions of attainments.
They always alleviate painful interactions
And are teachers of immortality.
“Exalted due to their beauty, delightful words, and renowned qualities,
They are in all regards adorned with the beauty of excellent qualities. 
As they enter their assemblies
They shine like the full moon in the final month of autumn.
“Those who adhere to this meditative absorption
Will, even within saṃsāra, have a retinue, enjoyments,
Family line, fame, and the recognition of the well-gone ones.
Their eloquent acumen will be as vast as the sea. 
“Those who practice this wondrous discourse 
Will soon realize and teach 
The selfless nature of all things,
Quickly becoming the doctor for the trichiliocosm.
“Finding attainment beyond death, they pass beyond
All of humanity and all the realms of sentient beings in the trichiliocosm,
As numerous the sand grains in the river Gaṅgā,
And so they attain the gateways of wisdom.
“Whoever engages in this practice with superior intent 
Becomes immune to poison, weapons, and fire,
And will not fear being arrested and punished by the king. 
They know no fear of kings or rākṣasas. 
“As they retain the four words,
They leave the household and do not waste the wealth of immortality.
They are not affected by fire, famine, or evil influence.
They do not become blind, deaf, or confused.
“Those who practice this peaceful absorption
Will receive the treasure of dhāraṇī.
Whoever practices this receives at that point 
The attention of six hundred and twenty million well-gone ones.
“If you wish to quickly reach awakening,
And if you wish for the supreme field of qualities,
Practice the way of this supreme discourse,
And omniscience will be in the palm of your hand. 
“Therefore, any sentient being who listens to this
And delights in virtue for the sake of awakening
Will attain the treasure of the ten powers 
By applying themselves to this for four days.
“Those who enter this supreme absorption
Will receive the constant attention
Of eight hundred million of the supreme among the two-legged,
As well as six hundred billion other victorious ones.
“Those who listen to this teaching, obtain it well,
And become inspired by listening
Will give up uncertainty and achieve awakening;
They will no longer have doubts or meet with saṃsāra.
“Those who listen to and correctly practice this discourse 
With diligence and appreciation for its qualities,
Who write this discourse down and bear it,
Are certain to find omniscience in the palms of their hands.
“With superknowledge I see that one hundred eons ago
There appeared a victorious one known as Crest Ornament of Eloquence.
He taught this supreme absorption
And the prince, Moon of Glory, listened.
“The prince abandoned his kingdom and soon went forth,
Listening keenly throughout day and night.
In his final session, he passed away
And then took miraculous birth in a different realm.
“There he worshiped the incomparable one for more days
Than there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā.
And for the sake of realizing awakening
He immersed himself in listening to this absorption for an eon. 
“As prophesied by the victorious Dīpaṅkara, 
He became the victor known as Jewel Crown Ornament.
Hence, since the effects of hearing this are great,
Do not be lazy once you have heard it. 
“With beautiful melodies, bring gods and humans 
To clear understanding and veneration.
Remember my explanation of this precious treasure.
Retain this jewel of the ten powers.
“Prāmodyarāja, in the past—innumerable, uncountable eons before—there appeared a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a complete and perfect buddha known as Proclaimer of the Melodious Thundering Roar of the Ornamental Beauty of Eloquence. Among the propagators of his Dharma teachings was a teacher known as Crest of the Banner of the Qualities of Infinite Eloquence. When he taught this absorption, a prince known as Teaching the Dharma to Many as the Pure Ripening of Merit offered a precious and priceless garment, and at the same time aroused the attitude of thinking ‘May all sentient beings achieve this absorption!’ 
 “By the roots of virtue ensuing from this, he delighted thus-gone ones more numerous than the grains of sand found in eighty Gaṅgā Rivers. From all those blessed ones he received this absorption, and Dharma teachings that had not been taught before appeared. He then recollected his continuous miraculous births. This prince, Teaching the Dharma to Many as the Pure Ripening of Merit, attained perfect awakening and, in the buddha realm known as Aparimita­guṇa­vyūha, became known as the buddha Amitāyus.  The monk and Dharma teacher called Crest of the Banner of the Qualities of Infinite Eloquence became the thus-gone one known as Great Eye. 
“When the prince had heard this absorption, he relinquished the karmic obscurations created during seven million eons. In all his lives he never parted—even for just as long as it takes to snap one’s fingers—from the dhāraṇī accomplished through the differentiating sections and infinite gateways. 
“There was also a thus-gone one known as Bright Countenance Like the Stainless Moon of the Essence of Glorious Splendor who taught and explained this absorption. When the son of a merchant, Vast Beauty and Fine Shape, listened to this teaching with his mind, he went forth from the household, abandoning seventy wives, a treasury that covered a league, and one thousand eight hundred gardens. He never again set his foot on ground covered with fabric. For ten thousand years after he had gone forth, he never wore footwear except in the latrine, but kept diligently on the move, free from drowsiness and sleep. When ten thousand years had passed, he obtained the dhāraṇī known as embodiment of the teachings, statements, and voices of all the buddhas, and he accomplished the absorption known as comprehending the use of all language. Receiving the veneration of six hundred thousand gods, he kept endeavoring. Now that he has accomplished virtue by body and mind, he resides in a world to the south that is adorned with all excellent qualities. There he has now truly awakened as a buddha and he is known as the thus-gone Reasoning Mind.” 
At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“I recollect eons more numerous, by comparison, 
Than the sands in the river Gaṅgā.
There once was a protector of the world
Who was known by the name of Melodious Eloquence. 
“A monk who was a skilled holder 
Of that buddha’s teachings
Explained this absorption,
And a prince listened.
“He offered his garments to the monk,
And made a dedication. 
Thus, he beheld the protectors, the buddhas,
And achieved awakening as Amitāyus.
“The ripening of the karma
Committed in the past
Is all brought to exhaustion 
Upon hearing this mass of wisdom.
“Also, when the buddha Stainless Moon
Taught this meditative absorption,
A merchant son listened,
Abandoned his household, and went forth.
“Relinquishing sleep and pleasures,
He refrained from wearing shoes,
And cultivated this absorption
For ten thousand years.
“Just by hearing this, 
He immediately attained supreme awakening, 
Never looking back at the household, wealth, or pleasures,
And having no fondness for enjoyments.
“He beheld infinite buddhas
And received teachings from them all.
Entering all the ways of the teachings,
He quickly realized them all.
“Practicing this absorption,
He has become known as Reasoning Mind.
Perfecting all intentions,
He has attained swift awakening.
“When in future times
People listen to this seal of wisdom,
They may feel no enjoyment or happiness,
Nor any wish to go forth.
“They may revile,
Abuse, threaten,
And disparage one another,
Yet still they will declare, ‘I shall become a buddha.’
“Those who have thousands of miseries in their home,
Yet still accept this as they consider the conditions of desire,
Are slaves of their own negative emotions,
And still they declare, ‘I shall become a buddha.’
“In their dreams they will behold
Buddhas and receive assurance.
They will thereby become filled with arrogating pride
And think, ‘There is no doubt that I am awakened.’
“Yet when such mistaken people
Merely hear the words of this discourse,
They will receive joyous relief
And understand, ‘Soon I will attain awakening.’
“Upon hearing and listening correctly 
To this genuine way,
They become free from grasping and attachment,
Like the wind that moves in the sky. 
“There are many others
Who may go forth for the sake of awakening,
Yet engage in arguments with each other 
And thereby develop flaws.
“Destitute and with poor understanding,
Based on hearing alone, they grow arrogant.
Feeling superior to others,
They think, ‘I have reached perfect awakening.’
“They discover relics, behold lights,
And with their hair standing on end worship the victors.
With meager knowledge about the attainment of awakening,
They nonetheless provoke great astonishment.
“Such people are exceedingly far from awakening,
And through their deceptions, 
They will suffer further decline—
They are exceedingly far from victory. 
“As they hear this discourse,
They come to know of those who will attain awakening,
And consequently they may think, ‘I should behold Amitāyus,’
Or ‘I must soon see a buddha.’
“Mired in such apprehensions,
They are exceedingly far from awakening.
Those who do not strive toward the limit of reality
Do not receive any prophecy.
“This merchant son 
Gave up his lucrative business,
And having gone forth,
He thenceforth adhered to the homes of almsgivers.
“Absorptions such as this
I have heard of from Dīpaṅkara.
Those lacking knowledge of reality
Will achieve nothing at all.
“Like someone who carries a load of hemp to sea,
Wishing for a priceless jewel,
Such fools may have gone forth,
But they only resort to the highest form of exploitation.
“Here learning, discipline, and going forth
Are not sufficient for purification.
To accomplish the path of awakening,
One must remain careful.
“In the future there will be people
Who will listen to such explanations,
But they will use them for making profits
And will speak offensively.
“There will be people who publicly
Offer prostrations and donations they call ‘auspicious,’
As well as dharma robes,
But who nevertheless speak offensively.
“They may shed tears 
And humble themselves,
But later they will gossip
That there are evildoers within the saṅgha. 
“They will not pay respect to their teachers
Or venerate their masters.
They will grow angry at the slightest provocation
And destroy even their own homes.
“They will have no faith in the merits of others
And pay no attention to their own faults.
When they come to know of the offerings received by others,
It will cause them terrible envy.
“They will say, ‘By worshiping physical remains
With parasols, banners, 
Dharma robes, and flowers,
I shall attain awakening.’
“Yet it is those who upon hearing these discourses
Give up all pleasures
And adhere to the practices
That offer me true worship.
“For example, it is like the worship of Subhūti:
Having renounced his own aggregates,
He worshiped the natural state—
What is the point of worshiping physical remains?
“When you meditate on this discourse
You should give up fondness for your own life,
Always adhere to solitude,
And be done with the world of livelihood.
“Prāmodyarāja, once you have heard 
Of these accomplishments explained by me,
You should never place your trust in people
As you move among them.
“When these people proclaim a self,
Saying, ‘this is true, that is untrue,’
They enjoy saying such unpleasant things,
But on these occasions, they just debase themselves.
“Those who have no concern for supreme awakening,
Except as a means of exploitation,
May seem respectful of awakening,
But they are exceedingly far from liberation.
“The attainments I have accomplished through vows,
My great true subjectivity,
And any miraculous abilities—
Are all these things seen here?
“Give up worldly profits and wealth
And remain in meditative seclusion
In the forest hermitage, like a deer. 
Engage in the spiritual levels, disciplines, and dhāraṇīs.
“I do not proclaim what is untrue,
But I give you spiritual blessings,
So that in the terrible times of the future
This discourse will be there for you.
“As in the case of Amitāyus, Lokanātha,
And Akṣobhya, who all shine with light,
Have you seen all the six hundred million
Buddhas with their retinues?
“Those teachers and their retinues 
Will uphold the Dharma in the future.
This discourse is the seal of Dharma.
In the future it will be accomplished.
“When the teaching was entrusted and received
The trichiliocosm shook,
The gods called out ‘Bravo!’
And let a rain of flowers fall.”
At that point the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, along with thirty thousand other bodhisattvas, rose from their seats, trembling, tearful, frightened, and with sweat emerging from their armpits. They rose, joined their palms in veneration, and facing in the direction of the Blessed One, they all spoke with one voice: “In the future time of repression—when Dharma teachers are disparaged and the wisdom of omniscience is denied, when the teachings are destroyed and the vision of wisdom is slight, when virtuous factors disintegrate and the means of livelihood vanish—we shall relinquish concern for our own body and life, and cut through all that is held to be pleasurable, as if with a sword. The path of the thus-gone ones, the seal of the flawless rich treasures of eloquence, the ocean that brings together the roots of virtue, and the dhāraṇīs that subdue the māras and accomplish omniscience are conveyed in discourses such as this one. We hereby pledge to write them down, carry them, and teach them at that time. Blessed One, even if it means living in hell, we shall do so happily for the sake of this precious absorption.”
The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja then offered these verses:
“Except for the world’s protector 
I have no other witness.
I aspire to awakening with whatever it takes—
Are you aware of my intention?
“Victorious One, even if 
In the future time of terror
I must fully relinquish my body and life, 
I shall uphold this absorption.
“Even if my mind must remain in hell
Throughout infinite eons,
I shall always do so happily
If I hold to this absorption.
“For the sake of all beings
I shall teach the Dharma free from materialistic concerns.
Giving up all acts of gathering,
I shall accomplish the objectives of living beings.
“In times to come
I will sacrifice my body and life,
My bones, flesh, and veins,
Rather than succumbing to laziness.
“Leaving behind all friends and acquaintances 
I shall stay in the wilderness,
Embrace all beings with love,
And dispense the medicine that cures all ills.
“I shall avoid training
In any mistaken domains,
And instead correctly engage 
In this discourse by all means.
“As the buddhas know,
I shall remain careful.
Firstly, wherever I may be,
I shall delight sentient beings.
“Even if I must jump into masses of fire
I shall keep pursuing the Dharma that cures all terror.
Yet never will I teach about supreme awakening
For the sake of fame and veneration.”
When this teaching of the Dharma was given, as many sentient beings as there are grains of sand in seventy Gaṅgās, who had arrived from innumerable world realms, all proceeded irreversibly to unexcelled and perfect awakening. The thousands of bodhisattvas likewise all attained this absorption. The teaching brought delight to one million gods, future teachers of the Dharma, who thus proceeded irreversibly to awakening. Seven billion gods purified the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. One hundred and eighty million members of the fourfold retinue of humans attained the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena.  All of the three lower realms were thoroughly pacified. The light of the Blessed One lit up as many world realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā. At that moment happiness came to all sentient beings, from the summit of existence down to the Hell of Ultimate Torment. Out of the Blessed One’s light appeared trillions of lotuses, each with a hundred thousand petals and adorned with infinite jewels. Upon each of those flowers was a thus-gone one, just like the blessed Śākyamuni, surrounded by his retinue. Each of them received the supplication of Prāmodyarāja, and each one consequently taught this absorption, allowing innumerable sentient beings to proceed irreversibly to unexcelled and perfect awakening. 
This was the first chapter, titled “Purifying Activity: The Teaching on Taking Up the Activities of the Bodhisattvas.”
Chapter 2
The Blessed One then said this to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Prāmodyarāja, in this way you must devote yourself to generosity and make offerings to the Dharma. Prāmodyarāja, long ago, many incalculable eons in the past, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a complete and perfect buddha known as Golden Beauty, King of the Splendid Light of Ascertainment. His lifespan was unfathomable, the features of his buddhafield were infinite, and his retinue was beyond count. 
“Later, during the final five hundred years of the teachings, there appeared a Dharma teacher by the name of Treasury of Engagement with the Infinite Jewel Body of Renown. When he taught this absorption all the other monks had completely strayed from the teachings. Nevertheless, this Dharma teacher was undeterred. Without concern for his own body and life,  he inhabited charnel grounds, living from roots and fruits, and thus he taught this absorption. At that point, the gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings through to the Unexcelled Heaven came to listen to his teachings. At that time there was also a universal monarch known as Roar That Causes Widespread Happiness and Freedom from Pain, who came to listen to that Dharma teacher’s explanation of this absorption. When he had received the teaching, he gave the gift of freedom from terror as he said to the Dharma teacher, ‘Monk, please teach this absorption, which the buddhas have genuinely bestowed. I shall protect and take care of you.’
“The monarch arranged for one thousand of his sons to be the teacher’s guards, and with his boundless attitude he arranged for thirty thousand people to provide pleasant living conditions. Thus, living comfortably, the teacher taught this absorption for half an eon. Due to the roots of virtue resulting from this, the Dharma teacher, the king, his sons, and all the other people involved came together to please three billion buddhas over a period of eighty eons, and they received this absorption from each of them. In accordance with their wishes, they also took up residence in buddha realms. Prāmodyarāja, you may believe that teacher was someone else, but you should not think so. He was none other than the thus-gone Amitāyus. The universal monarch was the thus-gone Akṣobhya, and the one thousand princes are the thousand buddhas of the Good Eon. And, Prāmodyarāja, all the other thirty thousand bodhisattvas were the beings who provided for, protected, and sustained the Dharma teacher in accordance with his wishes. 
“Prāmodyarāja, since this is the absorption of the bodhisattvas,  you must genuinely accomplish it. You must respectfully uphold this absorption of the bodhisattvas. You must gather it, write it down, and teach it.”
At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Were one to bring happiness to all sentient beings 
Throughout ten billion eons,
The merit of doing so would not withstand comparison
To but a single instance of cultivating the mind of awakening. 
“Even if all sentient beings in the ten directions
Were solitary buddhas
And one were to venerate them with all manner of pleasures for an eon,
The merit would be no match for that of supreme awakening.
“Even if all sentient beings in the world were buddhas
And one were to worship them according to their wishes for an eon,
The merit of doing so would not withstand comparison
To but a single instance of cultivating the mind of awakening. 
“The merit of someone who venerates a four-lined stanza
In order to protect the teachings of the Buddha
Is not like that of someone who gives rise to the mind of awakening
In order to protect awakening.
“The merit of establishing all beings of this world 
In great awakening 
Is surpassed by the one who listens without fear
When it is said that the aggregates do not exist. 
“The merit of the bodhisattva who fills all realms
With gifts of precious wealth 
For as many eons as there are sand grains in the Gaṅgā
Is outshone by the one who protects awakening.
“The merit of one four-lined stanza
Of this protection of awakening granted by the victorious ones—
This inconceivable treasure of absorption—
Cannot be put into words.
“Those who write down and maintain this absorption
Will at the time of their passing behold great assemblies of buddhas.
Mindful and never obscured, 
They will take birth wherever they wish.
“Those who delight in this king of absorption 
Will enjoy physical pleasure until the attainment of awakening.
They will have happiness of mind and proceed to the higher realms.
They will meet noble beings and never experience suffering. 
“Here I have taught the treasury of the victorious ones, 
The application of ten thousand gateways of infinite light,
The abode of supreme power—
Therefore, practice this absorption of awakening.
“This is as much as I can say in words,
And this is what you must pursue in action.
Apply yourselves constantly to this practice,
And you will not suffer later.
“Take my explanation, as if placed in your hand,
And employ it in practice with superior intent.
I have performed many loving deeds,
So treat this as a father’s guidance to his child.”
When the Blessed One had taught this absorption, he entered it. Likewise, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja entered equipoise, and for a period of seven days he discerned the phenomena associated with this absorption by means of careful investigation.
Then eighty-four thousand Licchavis who were gathered inside Vaiśālī and another eighty-four thousand Licchavis who had assembled outside Vaiśālī thought to themselves, “In order to benefit many beings, in order to bring happiness to many beings, and out of love for the world, the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has appeared in the world in order to help gods and humans and bring them happiness. But now the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has entered meditative seclusion. Who among us should now request that he rise from the absorption of the thus-gone ones?” 
The Licchavis who were assembled inside Vaiśālī went before the venerable Śāriputra and said,  “Venerable Śāriputra, at the time when the lifespan is short, the appearance of a buddha is rare, and faith is also rare. Now the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has entered equipoise. Please request the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha to consider us with a loving heart and to kindly reemerge from his meditative absorption.”
Upon hearing those words, the venerable Śāriputra went to the place where the Blessed One was residing. Yet, although Śāriputra searched for the Blessed One’s dwelling by entering meditative concentration and absorption, he could not discover the abode of the Thus-Gone One. 
The venerable Śāriputra then went to see the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, explaining to him about the intents and wishes of the Licchavis. In response, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana applied his miraculous abilities, thus causing the entire trichiliocosm to tremble and shake, and his voice reverberated through the whole world below the Realm of Brahmā, requesting the Thus-Gone One to reemerge from absorption. Yet the Blessed One did not emerge. 
At that time the venerable Śāriputra, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya, Bhadra, Subāhu, Mahānāma, Gavāmpati, Rāhula, Pūrṇa, Subhūti, Kātyāyana, Kāśyapa, Ānanda, Pūrṇāvara, Mahākapphiṇa, Upāli, and the bodhisattva Maitreya, along with five thousand other bodhisattvas, proceeded to the place where the Blessed One resided. Encircling the Blessed One, they took their seats. The Four Great Kings, Śakra who rules the gods, and innumerable gods of the desire realm arriving from the Heaven Free from Strife,  the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations likewise reached where the Blessed One resided. They bowed their heads before the Blessed One’s feet and then stood to one side. Likewise, from the heavens of Brahmā, Luminosity, Perfected Virtue, Great Fruition, and all the way up to the pure abodes, innumerable gods arrived. They all paid respect to the Blessed One and took their places. 
By then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja had dwelt undistractedly in meditative seclusion for seven days. When that period of seven days had passed, he began to discern and arose from meditative seclusion. Arriving at the courtyard where the Blessed One resided, he entered among the masterful bodhisattvas, bowed down, and then took his seat with his palms joined, facing the Blessed One.
Fully aware, the Blessed One now reemerged from his absorption. With the gaze of an elephant, he silently gazed upon the whole gathering.
 The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja at that point made this request to the Blessed One: “It is time for the Blessed One to deliver a Dharma discourse. If the Blessed One will grant me the occasion, I would like to request that certain matters be explained.”
 The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja,  “Noble son, you may ask the Thus-Gone One whatever you wish. I shall respond to all your questions. I shall satisfy you in this way.”
 The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja now made the following request to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, while I resided alone in the forest in meditative seclusion, I thought, ‘These bodhisattvas gain true accomplishment for the sake of awakening. By means of the perfections they accumulate roots of virtue for the sake of awakening.’ But I wonder, Blessed One, do the perfections benefit sentient beings or are they beneficial for awakening—are the perfections defiled or are they undefiled? I request the Blessed One to please explain these matters at length so that the perfections may develop in the bodhisattvas; so that the Dharma ways of the bodhisattvas may be engendered and upheld in the beginning, middle, and end; and so that such skillful practices may become the source of abundant, supreme joy.”
 The Blessed One replied, “Excellent, excellent, Prāmodyarāja! It is very good that you wish to question the Thus-Gone One about these matters, Prāmodyarāja. Indeed, you have posed this question to nine hundred million buddhas in the past. Therefore, Prāmodyarāja, listen very well and keep my words correctly in mind; I shall explain it to you.” 
 “Blessed One, I shall do just as you say.”
Addressing the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, the Blessed One then continued:  “Prāmodyarāja, there are six purifying perfections. There are six illuminating perfections. There are six mundane perfections. There are six perfections focused on sentient beings. There are six abiding perfections. There are six perfections for saṃsāra.

Now is the time for you to let the rain of nectar fall.

Liberating them with the ship of the factors of awakening.
“ ‘Bound by the view of the aggregates as a person,
People suffer from their views and are slaves of existence.
For so long they have been held back, tied, and unfree—
Why have the guides of beings not freed them?

Sleeping for so long, enveloped by their veils.

The five classes of beings are hopeless and blind.
Today you have discovered the sevenfold wealth.
How can you not grant them the true gift?

Why would you not let the rain of the factors of awakening
Fall from clouds of compassion with their lightning flashes of liberation?

Afflicted, miserable, chronically sick, and deprived of sustenance.
You who have obtained the supreme medicine of the factors of awakening,
Why would you not today liberate those who have suffered illness for so long?
“ ‘Wandering beings live in dense darkness,
Enveloped by ignorance and consumed by despair.
How can you not dispel this unbearable darkness 
With the lamp of insight shining throughout the trichiliocosm?
“ ‘Swept away by the four muddy rivers,
These distressed beings fall into the abyss.
Loving protector, how can you not now
Care for the world and save them?
“ ‘Due to non-Buddhist hordes who cling to their views,
Gods and humans remain confused.
With honesty, sincerity, and immutable bliss,
How can you not show them the precious path?
“ ‘The leonine ruler of men was beseeched by Brahmā
And the eyes of complete awakening see the three worlds.
As you see them, please have compassion for sentient beings
And turn the Dharma wheel of healing.’
“As the gods spoke these words,
I remained upon the lion seat of awakening.
Continuing their praises, they then joyfully dispersed
And thereupon, indeed, I turned the wheel of Dharma.”
The names
When the Blessed One had said this, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja asked, “Revered Blessed One, within this gathering of attending bodhisattva great beings, are there any who have attained these absorptions, these applications of the perfections, these eighty-four thousand gateways of absorption?” 
 The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja in the following way:  “Prāmodyarāja, except for the four thus-gone ones who in this Good Eon have already awakened to perfect buddhahood, all the rest of those who will awaken to perfect buddhahood in this Good Eon are present within this retinue of bodhisattva great beings, and they have attained those absorptions, those applications of the perfections, and those eighty-four thousand gateways of absorption.”
 The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja now replied to the Blessed One, “Wonderful, wonderful! Revered Blessed One! I request that you please state the families and names of those bodhisattvas. In that way numerous people may be healed and be happy. By showing your love for the world in this way, gods and humans will be successful, healed, and happy, and the sacred Dharma will be protected and remain for a long time. In the future, the bodhisattvas will gain understanding and practice without complacency for the sake of unexcelled and perfect awakening.”
The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, “Prāmodyarāja, listen very closely and keep my words correctly in mind; I shall explain it to you.” 
 “Blessed One, I shall do so,” answered the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, and he listened accordingly.
 The Blessed One now pronounced in verse the names of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas, as well as the names of the bodhisattvas:

“When the names of the buddhas 
Of the Good Eon resound,
Those who listen become free from ignorance
Concerning the fruition to be known, nirvāṇa.
“Wise ones, listen to these names of the victorious ones
With devotion and respect!
Those who have properly heard these names
Will not experience the suffering of the lower realms in the future.
“Those who maintain discipline and adhere to the vows,
Who become inspired by what they hear and gain understanding,
Will reach the perfection of profound acceptance
And behold these protectors of the world. 
“For those who, out of ignorance, have engaged 
In unwholesome actions throughout millions of eons,
The ripening of their actions will be exhausted,
And they will be victorious by remembering these names of the victorious ones.
“Thus, by means of this absorption,
Gain access to tens of thousands of discourses,
Absorptions, miraculous abilities, and factors of correct understanding;
Achieve knowledge of numerous languages; and accomplish wisdom. 
“Living by pure means and without deceit,
With knowledge of karmic ripening and free from envy,
Endeavor in the means of attraction and the dhāraṇīs,
So that you may fully understand this absorption.”
The lives
When the Blessed One had spoken these words, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja made the following request: “Blessed One, this is excellent. Blessed One, for the benefit of gods and humans, please explain about the birthplace, the family, the light, the father, the mother, the son, the attendant, the two foremost and excellent followers, the perfect community of monks, the lifespan, the duration of the sacred Dharma, and the manifestation of relics that pertain to each of these buddhas of the Good Eon, so that numerous beings may receive healing and be happy, and so that bodhisattvas of the future may persevere in hearing and remain inspired, become exceptionally accomplished in the sacred Dharma, and become sources of insight.”

This completes the account of the previous aspirations of the one thousand buddhas.
At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Such is the ripening
Of small donations made to buddhas.
Given that the effects in saṃsāra are of this kind,
What knowledgeable person would not give rise to the mind of awakening?
“It may be possible to comprehend the extent of the sky,
And it may be possible to gradually measure the great ocean,
Yet it is hard to measure the merit
Of even slight faith in the buddhas.
“Until reaching the bliss of nirvāṇa,
One will not have to suffer the pains of inopportune states.
Therefore, when they have attained the victorious fields of merit,
Humans should honor and worship with care.
“When, deeply inspired by the buddhas,
One presents even small offerings before the relics
Of the well-gone ones who have attained nirvāṇa,
The extent of the associated qualities is impossible to grasp, so keep that in mind!
“Offerings to the victorious ones by means of the mind of awakening, 
These four boundless Dharma teachings,
And the realms of space and of sentient beings
Can only be understood by the Teacher, and no one else.
“Compared to giving rise to and correctly abiding by the mind of awakening
In order to care for all sentient beings,
A poor person’s discovery of a treasure covering an entire league
Is not an occasion of happiness.
“The victorious ones’ eightfold reveling
For the sake of awakening, their ten powers, 
The five hundred congregations of sentient beings, the four delights, 
The eighty thousand applications of realization, 
“The eighty-four topics hard to comprehend,
The sixty thousand unsurpassable gateways,
The discernments of the grounds, the seventy-six forms of wisdom,
The eighteen modes of conduct that reveal the buddhas,
“The five subjugations of the beyond, the tenfold stability,
The eleven billion fields of activity,
The qualities of the buddhas,
Their marks and signs, and the modes of conduct—
“Since none of this is accessible even to solitary buddhas,
What need to speak of the hearers who follow the spoken word?
Unparalleled and incomparable,
Buddhahood is known to be inconceivable.
“Those intent on the highest awakening
Are not inferior, and their practice is unparalleled.
Discovering today the world’s great treasure,
They receive fine sustenance in the world.
“Conquering the māras and reaching the nectar,
They are satisfied by majestic rainclouds of beauty.
Entering awakening, those protectors of the world
Gather the seven riches.
“Bearing hundreds of pains,
Those entering awakening will never be weary.
Quickly attaining all these qualities,
They become the superiors of the entire world.
“Desires are the cause of numerous sufferings,
And as they ripen, beings fall into the lower realms.
As they proceed to the higher realms and accomplish the qualities of awakening,
What wise person would commit the breaches of the immature?
“Breaches are made by the immature, not by the wise.
Delusion belongs to the ignorant, while the well-informed achieve recollection.
Fools sink in swamps, while the wise reside on plains.
Those practicing the Dharma achieve acceptance.
“Therefore, give up the unreasonable
And adhere to facts and understanding.
Give up glory, fame, and riches,
And engage in the practice of this absorption.
“Given that recollecting even just a single quality of the buddhas 
Brings patient endurance of innumerable millennia of eons,
What need is there to mention the recollection of buddha qualities that are beyond the reach of thought? 
Therefore, wholeheartedly accept suffering and misery,
“Don the armor of patience and absorption,
Raise the banner of diligence, and ride the chariot of discipline.
With the arrows of generosity, strength, and insight,
Defeat the māras and victoriously proceed to awakening.
“Always keeping to the friendship of love and practice,
Delight in the perfections,
Cherish the home of emptiness, enjoy the food of power,
And thus accomplish the qualities of omniscience.
“In this way, comprehend well the teaching that is delivered here
And apply yourselves to it with care.
Like geese crying with joy as they fly through the sky,
Move on quickly into the achievement of omniscience.” 
“Prāmodyarāja, once in the past there was a thus-gone one by the name of Infinite Diligence, whose retinue numbered billions, and he taught this absorption. At that time there was a king known as Flower of Merit. The king heard that thus-gone one’s teaching and proceeded to speak as follows to his one thousand queens and one thousand sons: ‘I do not know the meaning of this exhaustive illumination of absorption. I do not know it, and I fail to understand. Nevertheless, we shall rejoice in these fine statements of the Thus-Gone One.’
 “As the king thus rejoiced in that blessed one’s excellent statements and explanations on this meditative absorption, he cast aside eighty thousand eons of saṃsāra and looked beyond. He attained the recollection called heavenly bodies, and he indeed became free from doubt with respect to this teaching of awakening. By the roots of virtue ensuing from that, he went on to please three hundred thousand buddhas, and from each of them he received this absorption. Never again would he descend into error or inopportune states.  By this very cause, he accomplished perfect and complete buddhahood. He became perfectly and completely awakened. 
 “Prāmodyarāja, do not think that Flower of Merit, the king at that point and at that time, was someone else. At that point and at that time, the thus-gone Amitāyus was King Flower of Merit, and the thus-gone ones of this Good Eon were his one thousand sons. If simply rejoicing in this absorption has that much power, what can we say about reading this, receiving its scriptural transmission, and putting it into practice?
 “Prāmodyarāja, once in the past there was a thus-gone one by the name of Nectar Joy whose retinue numbered hundreds of thousands. A universal monarch named Vast Mind offered that thus-gone one a palace shining with golden light, moistened by the sap of red sandalwood, and perfumed with the incense of myrobalan. For their enjoyment, he also offered each member of the saṅgha of monks the exact same gift. Moreover, he offered every one of them a pleasure garden. Thus, he came to hear this absorption from that blessed one. 
 “He then said to the best among the scholars attending that blessed one, someone by the name of Perfect Insight, ‘I must understand this absorption. But doing so is difficult as long as one remains in a household. I must by all means shave off my hair and beard, go forth from the household, and become a homeless mendicant. There can be no doubt about this.’ He then did shave off his hair and beard, don the saffron-colored robes, go forth from the household, and become a homeless mendicant. All his ten thousand sons and eighty-four thousand queens went forth at the same time, wishing to receive the various aspects of this absorption.  Knowing their thoughts, that blessed one proceeded to teach them this absorption in detail for a period of seven days. As they heard this teaching, they said to one another, ‘Alas, this absorption is difficult to behold. Nevertheless, we shall write this down carefully, and we shall uphold this.’ 
“Hence, they wrote down this absorption and made it their object of worship. They retained it and received its transmission. After they had passed away, they all came together again, and they pleased six hundred thousand buddhas. They kept hearing this absorption, and they all went forth and obtained this absorption. In accordance with their prayers and by these roots of virtue alone, they all attained awakening. 
“Prāmodyarāja, do not think that, at that point and at that time, the universal monarch named Vast Mind was someone else. The thus-gone Dīpaṅkara was at that point and on that occasion the universal monarch known as Vast Mind, and the thus-gone Vilocana was the monk and attendant by the name of Perfect Insight. His ten thousand sons will remain unable to reach awakening for thirty-five eons, counting from the present one. Then will follow an eon called Great Renown, and during that single eon all of them will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. After the eon called Great Renown is over, the eighty thousand ministers will remain unable to reach awakening for eighty eons. Then will follow an eon called Star-Like, during which those eighty thousand ministers will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood.  After the eon called Star-Like will follow three hundred eons during which no buddhas will appear. Then there will be an eon known as Array of Qualities, and during that time the eighty-four thousand queens will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. Prāmodyarāja, such are the fruits born by this absorption of the bodhisattvas.
“Prāmodyarāja, in this way the superior wishes of the bodhisattvas are fulfilled. Without regard for your own body or life, pursue this absorption. If you wish to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, then you should adhere to the practice of this absorption.”
At that point the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Those in pursuit of the buddhas’ awakening
Should train in the footsteps of those kings.
For, besides adhering to true practice,
There is no way to achieve supreme awakening.
“Even if one’s faith in this is weak,
The ripening achieved will be sublime.
Therefore, with unswerving, superior intent,
Engage in this spiritual practice with all manner of respect.
“Those who wish to see the victors
Of whom I have here spoken,
And who wish for extensive explanation,
Should, just as taught, take up this spiritual practice.
“Since merely rejoicing brings such excellence,
What need is there to mention the effects of holding and reading this?
No wandering being can conceive of the extent of these qualities.
Upon hearing this, who would not engage in this spiritual practice?
“Awakening, correct knowledge, distinctive features,
Teaching, inspiring the minds of others,
Practice, and illumination—all these buddha qualities
Should be pursued through this absorption.
“Purification of karma, defeating the māras,
Purifying beliefs, bringing existence to the point of exhaustion, 
Reveling, and the rich arrays of the pure fields—
None of these are rare for the one who is in possession of this. 
“Likewise, liberation, perfect acumen,
Universal mastery of actions,
Bodies suited to one’s wishes, and awakening to buddhahood—
All of these are abundant for the one who abides by this.
“As I have spoken here of these matters in abundant words, 
Do follow them up here and accomplish them!
Those who do not delight in the qualities of omniscience
Will surely have regrets in the future.
“The many perfections I have taught,
Along with the paths for reaching the ocean of wisdom,
Remain beyond the scope of comprehension
Of corporeal beings engaged in infantile conduct. 
“In evil times when beings are wicked,
When the Dharma is about to disappear and the lower realms are looming,
The wise will feel deep remorse.
They will be cautious and timid, like deer.
“Prāmodyarāja, compared to the amount of merit accomplished by a bodhisattva who has practiced the six perfections with comprehensive skill throughout one thousand eons, the merit that arises when hearing about this absorption and rejoicing is far greater—beyond all comparison.”
When the Blessed One gave this Dharma teaching, innumerable bodhisattvas gave rise to the mind of unexcelled perfect and complete awakening, and they all irreversibly attained unexcelled perfect and complete awakening. Moreover, eight hundred thousand gods and humans attained the pure Dharma eye that beholds phenomena immaculately and without stain. Since the eyes of those gods were now pure, they delighted in the Blessed One’s Dharma and scattered flowers throughout this trichiliocosm.  The trichiliocosm shook in six distinctive ways, and the sounds of divine drums filled the air. Prāmodyarāja, along with all the millions of other bodhisattvas, attained this meditative absorption.
When the Blessed One had said these words, Prāmodyarāja and all the other bodhisattva great beings—as well as the whole world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas—rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One. 
This completes the noble sūtra of the Great Vehicle, known as “The Good Eon.”
