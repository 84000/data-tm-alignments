In the language of Tibet, it is called Dulwa Shi. 
{{milestone:{label:p.2,id:UT22084-001-001-107}}}Homage to the Three Jewels.
{{milestone:{label:p.3,id:UT22084-001-001-108}}}Homage to him who severed the bonds,
Destroyed the whole host of tīrthikas,
Vanquished the armies of Māra,
And thus discovered this awakening.
{{milestone:{label:p.4,id:UT22084-001-001-109}}}At first to renounce a householder’s concerns and go forth is hard.
For a hedonist to be happy among renunciants is hard.
For the joyful set on perfection to act perfectly is hard.
For a learned wearer of the saffron robes to fall is hard.
{{milestone:{label:p.5,id:UT22084-001-001-110}}}The Chapters on Monastic Discipline includes chapters on:
Going forth, purification, 
Lifting restrictions, the rains, leather,
Medicine, robes, turning cloth into robes, 
The monks of Kauśāmbī, formal acts of saṅgha,
A group of troublesome monks, types of persons,
Probations, suspension of the purification,
Housing, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-001-001-29041,folio:F.2.a}}} disputes, and schisms in the saṅgha.{{note:{index53,id:UT22084-001-001-111}}}
{{milestone:{label:p.6,id:UT22084-001-001-112}}}The whole of “The Chapter on Going Forth” 
Is told in sections on:
Śāriputra, tīrthikas,
The two novices, scaring a crow,
Killing an arhat, and missing hands. 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1}}}Śāriputra
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-001-001-113}}} The Śāriputra section is told over five chapters: 
 Śāriputra, going forth, refuge, a summary of Upasena’s collection, and a summary of the fives. 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-1}}}Śāriputra
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-001-001-114}}}While the Bodhisattva was dwelling in the Abode of Tuṣita, the King of Aṅga ruled over the lands of Aṅga.  Under his rule, the kingdom prospered and thrived, crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people.  Meanwhile, King Mahāpadma ruled over the lands of Magadha.  Under his rule, the kingdom prospered and thrived, crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people.  At times, the King of Aṅga and his armies were dominant. At other times, King Mahāpadma and his armies were dominant. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-001-001-115}}}At a time when the King of Aṅga and his armies were dominant,  he called up the four branches of his armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—and laid waste to all of  Magadha, save Rājagṛha, before returning.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-001-001-116}}}At a time when King Mahāpadma and his armies were dominant,  he too called up the four branches of his armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—and {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-001-001-29042,folio:F.2.b}}} laid waste to all of  Aṅga, save Campā, before returning. 
At yet another time when the King of Aṅga and his armies were dominant,  he again called up the four branches of his armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—and began again to lay waste to  the land of Magadha, prompting the people of Magadha to send a message to King Mahāpadma, saying, “Your Majesty, the King of Aṅga has called up the four branches of his armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—and is laying waste to the lands of Magadha.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-001-001-118}}}When King Mahāpadma heard this, he too called up the four branches of his armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—and rode out to meet the King of Aṅga in battle. 
The King of Aṅga captured King Mahāpadma’s entire elephant corps and proceeded to capture the whole of his cavalry, charioteer corps, and infantry. Defeated and frightened, destroyed and conquered, King Mahāpadma retreated. Entering Rājagṛha, he closed the gates and shut himself up within the walls of his fortress. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-001-001-120}}}The King of Aṅga sent an envoy to King Mahāpadma with the message, “It would be good were you to come out. If you do not surrender, and instead take flight into the sky above, I will fell you with a volley of arrows. Tunnel beneath the earth and I will yank you up as if with a hook. Flee to the mountaintops, and even there you shall find no escape.”
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-001-001-121}}}King Mahāpadma was unsettled by the message he heard.{{note:{index54,id:UT22084-001-001-122}}} Head in hands, he sat and sat, absorbed in thought.{{note:{index55,id:UT22084-001-001-123}}} Then he said to his ministers, “Gentlemen, this King of Aṅga {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-001-001-29043,folio:F.3.a}}} is belligerent, ruthless, and his military might is great. If he gives an order, how can we not obey?”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-001-001-124}}}They spoke in verse:
“When land and life are threatened,
Seek always to protect life. 
When the wise look at both, they see 
Land, but not life, can be found again.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-001-001-126}}}They then implored him, “Your Majesty, any way you look at it, you must go out!” 
King Mahāpadma hung his sword from his neck in surrender and went out, where the King of Aṅga imposed an annual tribute and tax upon him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-001-001-128}}} While the blessed Bodhisattva was dwelling in the Abode of Tuṣita, he saw five sights{{note:{index56,id:UT22084-001-001-129}}} and thrice gave notice to the six classes of gods who revel in the desire realm. Assuming an elephant’s appearance, he entered his mother’s womb as the earth shook and this world and all others too were  bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the Thirty-Three. So great was this miraculous manifestation, it was as if the sun and moon shone in the gulf between worlds.{{note:{index57,id:UT22084-001-001-130}}} So great was its strength that darkness everywhere, even the pitch-black darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon, was filled with a vast light. Beings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched hands, yet by this light these beings saw one another and exclaimed, “You there! There are others who have been born here! There are others who have been born here!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-001-001-131}}}At the same time as the blessed Bodhisattva was born, sons were also born to four great kings in four great city-states. In Rājagṛha the son of King Mahāpadma was born. In Śrāvastī the son of King Arāḍa Brahmadatta was born. In Ujjayinī {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-001-001-29044,folio:F.3.b}}} the son of King Anantanemi was born. In Kauśāmbī the son of King Śatānīka was born. 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-001-001-132}}}When the blessed Bodhisattva was born, the entire universe was  bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the Thirty-Three. So great was this miraculous manifestation, it was as if the sun and moon shone in the gulf between worlds. So great was its strength that darkness everywhere, even the pitch-black darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon, was filled with a vast light. Beings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched hands, yet by this light these beings saw one another and exclaimed, “You there! There are others who have been born here! There are others who have been born here!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-001-001-134}}}King Mahāpadma thought, “When my son was born, the world was lit as if by the gold of the rising sun. And as he is the son of Queen Bimbī (Goldie), I shall name this prince Bimbisāra (Essence of Gold).” And so the boy was named Bimbisāra.
King Arāḍa Brahmadatta thought, “When my son was born, the world was lit as if by the light of lights, so I shall name this prince Prasenajit (Supreme Light).” And so the boy was named Prasenajit.
King Śatānīka thought, “When my son was born, the world was lit as if by the rising sun, so I shall name this prince Udayana (Rising).” And so the boy was named Udayana.
King Anantanemi thought, “When my son was born, the world was lit by a brilliant light, so I shall name this prince Pradyota (Brilliant Light).” And so the boy was named Pradyota. 
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-001-001-136}}}And so each king attributed the light to the birth of his own son. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-001-001-29045,folio:F.4.a}}} Though each attributed it to his own son, it was not so. For all that occurred, occurred because of the Bodhisattva. 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-001-001-2883}}}On the very same day that Prince Bimbisāra was born, five hundred sons of five hundred ministers were also born and were given names appropriate to their patrilineage. 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-001-001-139}}}Prince Bimbisāra  was entrusted to eight nursemaids:{{note:{index58,id:UT22084-001-001-140}}} two to cuddle him, two to breastfeed him, two to change his diapers, and two to play with him.{{note:{index59,id:UT22084-001-001-141}}} Fortified with milk, curd, butter, ghee, cream, and other nourishing foods, he grew quickly, shooting up like a lotus in a pond.  When he was old enough, he was introduced to letters, number names, calculation, counting by hand, expenditures, revenues, and deposits.{{note:{index60,id:UT22084-001-001-142}}} After he finished letters, he became skilled in exegesis, recitation, knowledge, proper conduct,{{note:{index61,id:UT22084-001-001-143}}} and the way to assess gems, sites, fabrics, woods, elephants, horses, women, and men. 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-001-001-144}}} He trained in and mastered the different fields of arts and skills of anointed kṣatriya kings, or a ruler of the realm endowed with the might and vigor to conquer the wide face of the earth, such as riding on the neck of an elephant, riding horseback, charioteering, swordsmanship, archery, advancing, yielding, wielding a hook, throwing a lasso, casting a spear, and how to hold a weapon, march, tie a topknot,{{note:{index62,id:UT22084-001-001-145}}}{{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-001-001-29047,folio:F.4.b}}} slash, quarter, pierce, and strike in five ways—striking from a distance, striking a target using acoustic location, striking a fatal blow, striking without hesitation, and striking forcefully. 
These arts and skills were also mastered by the five hundred sons of the five hundred ministers. 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-001-001-146}}}Bimbisāra’s father enrolled him in the eighteen guilds, due to which he was named and became known as Bimbisāra of the Guilds.{{note:{index63,id:UT22084-001-001-148}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-001-001-149}}}Later Prince Bimbisāra set out astride an elephant where he saw the King of Aṅga’s officers collecting tributes and taxes, prompting him to inquire of his men, “Gentlemen, for whom are these tributes and taxes being collected?” 
“Your Majesty! For the King of Aṅga.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-001-001-151}}}“What? Will we be offered tribute?” 
“No, Your Majesty, we are the ones to offer the tribute.” 
“Gentlemen, summon those officers.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-001-001-154}}}When the officers were summoned, he said, “Gentlemen, the King of Aṅga is  crowned and an anointed kṣatriya king.  If I too am crowned and an anointed a kṣatriya king, why is it you are collecting tributes and taxes here? I forbid you to collect tributes and taxes from this day forth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-001-001-155}}}“The prince fails to appreciate the situation,” they thought. “Let us go submit the matter to King Mahāpadma.”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-001-001-133482}}}They went to King Mahāpadma and said, “Your Majesty, when we officers of the King of Aṅga were collecting tributes and taxes, Prince Bimbisāra stopped us from doing so. Shall we collect them or not?”
“Gentlemen, the prince doesn’t understand the situation. Continue to collect tributes and taxes as you have done before.”
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-001-001-157}}}They {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-001-001-29048,folio:F.5.a}}} had begun their collection again when Prince Bimbisāra spotted them on their way back and said, “Gentlemen, have I not already prohibited you from collecting tributes and taxes? Why are you collecting them again? You are to desist. Fail to desist and I shall close the borders.”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-001-001-159}}}Frightened, they thought, “The prince is dangerous and ruthless. In time he may pose a serious risk to us. We must go warn the King of Aṅga.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-001-001-133483}}}They went before the King of Aṅga and said, “Your Majesty, as officers of the court, we were collecting tributes and taxes on your behalf when King Mahāpadma’s son, Prince Bimbisāra, stopped us. If Your Majesty  ignores the prince’s actions, he may, in time, pose a serious risk to us.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-001-001-161}}}Then they spoke in verse:
“When a tree is small, 
Fingernails may fell it.
Yet when the tree is large, 
Even a hundred axes may fail.”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-001-001-163}}}The King of Aṅga sent a letter to King Mahāpadma: “Send Prince Bimbisāra with his sword hung from his neck—or prepare your pyre and shroud, for I myself will come!”
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-001-001-133484}}}King Mahāpadma heard this letter read and was troubled.  Head in hands, he sat and sat, absorbed in thought.  Then he summoned Prince Bimbisāra and said, “Son, why did you stop the King of Aṅga’s officers from collecting tributes and taxes? They have sent me a letter expressing their anger.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-001-001-165}}}“Your Majesty, why do we pay tribute and taxes to him?” 
“Son, we are tributaries.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-001-001-167}}}“If the King of Aṅga is an anointed a kṣatriya king and we too {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-001-001-29049,folio:F.5.b}}} are anointed kṣatriya kings, why do we offer tribute and taxes to him? Give me an army of just four divisions, Your Majesty, and I will meet the King of Aṅga in battle.”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-001-001-168}}}King Mahāpadma then sent a message to the King of Aṅga, saying, “You had best hope all the power, forces, will, and authority you possess do not fail you!”
The King of Aṅga found this message intolerable and commanded his ministers, “Gentlemen, lay waste to those lands! Call up the four branches of the armed forces.”
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-001-001-169}}}Having called up the four branches of the armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—they began to lay waste to the land of Magadha. The people of Magadha sent a message to King Mahāpadma, saying, “Your Majesty, the King of Aṅga has called up the four branches of his armed forces—the elephant corps, the cavalry, the charioteer corps, and the infantry—and is laying waste to the lands of Magadha.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-001-001-171}}}King Mahāpadma was troubled by this news and, head in hands, sat and sat, absorbed in thought. He summoned Prince Bimbisāra and gave him charge over the four branches of the armed forces. Prince Bimbisāra gathered the five hundred ministers’ sons and said, “Gentlemen, what if I were to meet the King of Aṅga in battle? What would you do?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-001-001-133485}}}“Prince, your struggle shall be our struggle!” they responded.
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-001-001-173}}}Then they said in verse:
“In whose house dwells glory, 
It is he we should protect.
If he falls, then all fall,
As spokes at a hub’s collapse.”
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-001-001-175}}}Prince Bimbisāra said, “Now {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-001-001-29050,folio:F.6.a}}} you must do all you can to protect me.”
“Whatever Your Majesty’s plight may be, that too shall be ours. Wherever Your Majesty’s foot may fall, there shall we bow our heads.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-001-001-177}}}The four branches of the armed forces were then called up and they set out from Rājagṛha. When King Mahāpadma, who sat shut up in his upper citadel surrounded by his council, saw them depart, he asked his ministers, “Gentlemen, whose army is this?”
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-001-001-133486}}}“Your Majesty, it is Prince Bimbisāra’s.”
“Gentlemen! It is awesome to behold!”
Hence, the prince was named and became known as Bimbisāra of the Army. Some knew him as Bimbisāra of the Guilds while some knew him as Bimbisāra of the Army. 
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-001-001-180}}}Prince Bimbisāra said to the five hundred sons of the ministers, “Gentlemen, this King of Aṅga is belligerent, ruthless, and his military might is great so we cannot meet him in battle. Therefore, we will sneak in, overrun his exposed camp, and kill him while their guard is down and their armor off.”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-001-001-182}}}They overran the King of Aṅga’s exposed camp while their guard was down and their armor off, sneaking up and killing him. The four branches of the King of Aṅga’s armed forces scattered to the four directions. Prince Bimbisāra sent mounted emissaries in the four directions with the message,  “Gentlemen, you are anointed kṣatriya kings, and I too am an anointed kṣatriya king, so return! Gentlemen, I will support you!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-001-001-183}}}He whom the King of Aṅga left to defend the city of Campā {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-001-001-29051,folio:F.6.b}}} heard how the King of Aṅga had been killed, prompting him to close the gates and take cover within the walls of the fortress. When at last Prince Bimbisāra reached Campā, the prince fixed the King of Aṅga’s head onto a long pole and displayed it, saying, “It is I who has brought your lord to this state. Come out immediately and I shall look favorably upon you. Fail to appear and you too will soon find yourself in this state.”
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-001-001-184}}}It distressed the steward of Campā to hear this, and he thought of this verse:
 “When land and life are threatened,
Seek always to protect life. 
When the wise look at both, they see 
Land, but not life, can be found again.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-001-001-186}}}With that thought he hung his sword from his neck in surrender and came out. 
With the King of Aṅga slain, Campā fell into Prince Bimbisāra’s hands, at which point he sent a message to King Mahāpadma, saying, “Your Majesty, I have slain the King of Aṅga and Campā is now in my hands. Your Majesty, tell me what else needs to be done and I shall see to it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-001-001-188}}}Pleased, King Mahāpadma sent Prince Bimbisāra a parasol, a turban, and a coronet with the message, “Son, you must take the reins of power there. I, for my part, will assume the reins of power here.”
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-001-001-133487}}}And so Prince Bimbisāra assumed the reins of power. Under him, the kingdom prospered and thrived, crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people. 
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-001-001-190}}}Once King Mahāpadma’s time had come, the ministers of Rājagṛha sent a message to King Bimbisāra, saying, “Your Majesty, your father’s time has come.” In a great coronation ceremony, the ministers of Rājagṛha and Magadha granted him sovereignty over the lands of Aṅga and Magadha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-001-001-191}}}Under King Bimbisāra’s rule, the kingdoms of Aṅga and Magadha prospered and thrived, crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people. He completely pacified conflict, {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-001-001-29052,folio:F.7.a}}} aggressors, and enemies from without as well as disturbances from within. He rid the land of brigands, thieves, famine, and illness, and brought a wealth of rice, sugar cane, cattle, and buffalo; thus the just Dharma king established a just kingdom.
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-001-001-192}}}There was a young brahmin who, desiring and in search of esoteric instruction, left the Middle Country and went to the South, where there was a brahmin to whom the Vedas and the limbs of the Vedas had been entrusted, who had been a teacher to brahmins living in a country to the south.{{note:{index64,id:UT22084-001-001-193}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-001-001-194}}}The young brahmin went to see this teacher of brahmins. Serene, the young brahmin bowed his head calmly and sat off to one side. The brahmin teacher warmly greeted him with words of welcome, and asked, “Young brahmin, where have you come from and what do you desire?”
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-001-001-195}}}“I hail from the Middle Country and I seek to serve at the feet of a preceptor.”
“Why?”
“So that I may study the Vedas.”
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-001-001-133488}}}“Excellent, my son. You should do just that, for that is a brahmin’s duty.”
And so, the young brahmin began to study the Vedas with the teacher of brahmins. 
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-001-001-198}}} The brahmins’ students were in the habit, when not occupied with their studies, of going to the riverbank to bathe, visiting the city, or collecting wood for use in fire pūjas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-001-001-201}}}Once, when not occupied with their studies, they went to collect wood for fire pūjas. On the way they had the following conversation. “Sons of Kutsa, sons of Vātsa, sons of Śāṇḍili, sons of Bhāradvāja, sons of the Five, sons of the Further Five.{{note:{index65,id:UT22084-001-001-202}}} To begin with, let us share where we come from, from which land we hail.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-001-001-203}}}“I am from the East,” one young brahmin responded. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-001-001-29053,folio:F.7.b}}}
“I am from the South,” said another.
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-001-001-133489}}}“I am from the West.”
“I am from the North.”
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-001-001-207}}}The young brahmin then said, “I am from the Middle Country.”
To him they said,  “Sir! We have seen and heard of all those other countries, but have neither seen nor heard of the Middle Country.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-001-001-210}}}And then they added this verse:
“In the East they are wise,
In the South they are cunning,
In the West they stir division,
In the North they speak roughly.”
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-001-001-211}}}“Young brahmin,” they asked, “what is the Middle Country like?”
“Gentlemen, the Middle Country is the best of all lands, abounding in rice, sugar cane, cattle, and buffalo, thronging with hundreds of honest women and filled with upstanding men, devoid of foreign savages, and guided by learned men. The river Gaṅgā, bountiful, meritorious, auspicious, and clean, flows through this famed land, irrigating both shores. At one point, where sages are known to gather, the river flows through eighteen bends. There, sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities.”{{note:{index66,id:UT22084-001-001-213}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-001-001-214}}}“Young brahmin, having met you, we have another question. Do you have men counted as learned in the Middle Country?”
“Gentlemen, from the first did I not say, ‘Gentlemen, the Middle Country is filled with upstanding men, devoid of foreign savages, and guided by learned men’?”

{{milestone:{label:1.82,id:UT22084-001-001-247}}}Māṭhara was thrilled, delighted, and overjoyed. Surrounded by learned men, he returned to his village. And since the world desires success {{page:{number:17,id:UT22084-001-001-29057,folio:F.9.b}}} and distrusts failure, several brahmins pressed their daughters on him in marriage. Māṭhara then  took a wife of equal caste and together they played with, took pleasure in, and amused one another.  The wife with whom he had played, taken pleasure, and amused himself gave birth to a son with an extraordinarily long torso. Three weeks or twenty-one days after the birth, relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style, during which time they chose a name for the boy.

Then, he was instructed in the ways of brahmins: their conduct, ritual purity, and observances; the handling of ashes, the handling of ritual vases, and the handling of sites; hand gestures, turbans, offering praise, and salutations; the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda, the Sāmaveda, and the Atharvaveda; and a brahmin’s six duties—making fire sacrifices, officiating over fire sacrifices, studying, teaching, giving, and receiving. The Vedas the limbs of the Vedas were entrusted to him, and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-001-001-29058,folio:F.10.a}}} and vanquish those of others. 
{{milestone:{label:1.84,id:UT22084-001-001-249}}}The wife with whom Māṭhara had played, taken pleasure, and amused himself again gave birth, this time to a girl with eyes like a śārī bird. Three weeks or twenty-one days after the birth, relatives came and gathered to celebrate her birth in grand style, during which time they chose a name for the girl. The relatives said, “Since this girl has eyes like a śārī, this girl should be given the name Śārikā.”  The girl Śārikā was nurtured and grew. Her father taught her how to combine letters into words so she became proficient in reciting. 
{{milestone:{label:1.85,id:UT22084-001-001-250}}}Later, when the young brahmin Koṣṭhila was debating Śārikā, Śārikā vanquished him and their father said to Koṣṭhila, “Son, if you are a male, how has a female vanquished you? Once I’m gone, the spoils I’ve won in debate will be taken away.”
At that the young brahmin Koṣṭhila, desiring and in search of esoteric instruction, set off from the Middle Country for the South.

Later, as Tiṣya and Śārikā played with, took pleasure in, and amused one another,  a sentient being in search of his final rebirth, who had grasped the essence of liberation, who had turned to nirvāṇa and away from saṃsāra, who had seen that all births end in death, who did not seek to be reborn, and who was to take his last body, died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered Śārikā’s womb. 
{{milestone:{label:1.136,id:UT22084-001-001-313}}}Śārikā dreamed that a man carrying a torch {{page:{number:26,id:UT22084-001-001-29066,folio:F.14.a}}} rent and entered her belly. She climbed to a mountain peak. She moved through the sky above. An assembly of great men prostrated to her. She then told Tiṣya about her dream. Though Tiṣya was expert at interpreting dreams and omens, he consulted other brahmins who interpreted them. “What does it portend,” he asked, “if my brahmin wife has had such a dream?”
{{milestone:{label:1.137,id:UT22084-001-001-314}}}They replied, “Preceptor, that is an excellent portent. Her statement, ‘A man carrying a torch rent and entered my belly,’ indicates a son will be born. It portends that, after twice eight years, he will have studied the Aindra school of grammar{{note:{index79,id:UT22084-001-001-315}}} and will vanquish all opponents. She said, ‘I climbed to a mountain peak. I moved through the sky above. An assembly of great men prostrated to me.’ These statements indicate her son will go forth and become a great saint who perfects his vow.”
{{milestone:{label:1.138,id:UT22084-001-001-316}}} The next time Tiṣya and Śārikā engaged in debate, Śārikā vanquished him, making him wonder, “If I have vanquished her in the past, what now has allowed her to vanquish me?”
He thought, “It is because of the being who has entered her womb.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.139,id:UT22084-001-001-318}}} After eight or nine months, a boy was born, well proportioned, pleasing to the eye, handsome, radiant, with a golden complexion, a head shaped well like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead,{{note:{index80,id:UT22084-001-001-319}}} eyebrows that met,  and a prominent nose. 
After his birth, Śārikā said to Tiṣya, “If we present this brahmin boy to his grandfather, he will give him a name.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.140,id:UT22084-001-001-320}}}They took him to his grandfather Māṭhara, who {{page:{number:27,id:UT22084-001-001-29067,folio:F.14.b}}} thought about what he should name the baby boy. “This brahmin boy is the son of the brahmin Tiṣya so I shall name this brahmin boy Upatiṣya.” And with that he named him Upatiṣya (Tiṣya’s Heir).
{{milestone:{label:1.141,id:UT22084-001-001-322}}}Tiṣya said, “His grandfather thought of a name for this brahmin boy and chose Upatiṣya.”
He thought, “His grandfather has named this brahmin boy after his father so I shall name him after his mother. Since this brahmin boy is the son of his mother Śārikā, I shall name him Śāriputra.” And with that he was named Śāriputra (Śārikā’s Son).
{{milestone:{label:1.142,id:UT22084-001-001-2899}}}It was thus that the young brahmin was known to some as Śāriputra, while to others he was known as Upatiṣya. 
{{milestone:{label:1.143,id:UT22084-001-001-324}}}Upatiṣya  was entrusted to eight nursemaids: two to cuddle him, two to breastfeed him, two to change his diapers, and two to play with him.{{note:{index81,id:UT22084-001-001-2900}}} Fortified with milk, curd, butter, ghee, cream,  and other nourishing foods, he grew quickly, shooting up like a lotus in a pond.  When he was old enough, he was introduced to letters, number names, calculation, counting by hand, and how to exclude, to add, to leave, and to parse until he had mastered reciting.  He was then instructed in the ways of brahmins: their conduct, ritual purity, and observances; the handling of ashes, the handling of ritual vases, and the handling of sites; hand gestures, turbans, offering praise, and salutations; the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda, the Sāmaveda, and the Atharvaveda; and a brahmin’s six duties—making fire sacrifices, officiating over fire sacrifices, studying, teaching, {{page:{number:28,id:UT22084-001-001-29068,folio:F.15.a}}} giving, and receiving. The Vedas and the limbs of the Vedas were entrusted to him, and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others. 
{{milestone:{label:1.144,id:UT22084-001-001-327}}}His father made him study all fields of knowledge, and thus by the age of sixteen he had studied the Aindra school of grammar and could vanquish all opponents. 
{{milestone:{label:1.145,id:UT22084-001-001-133514}}}At another time when he was reciting the Vedas with his father, he asked, “Father, what is the meaning of this statement?”
“Son, even I do not know the meaning of this statement. But  these sacred mantra{{note:{index82,id:UT22084-001-001-330}}} have been recited with praise, sung, and furnished by past sages. Nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.146,id:UT22084-001-001-331}}}“Father, do you think there is no meaning to these sacred mantra, which have been recited with praise, sung, and furnished by past sages, but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins? This is what such statements mean,” and he proceeded to explain.
{{milestone:{label:1.147,id:UT22084-001-001-133515}}}Tiṣya  was delighted and in his delight thought, “This is what a son should do: he should carry on his father’s tradition or develop his insight even further. Were he to accomplish only this, this brahmin boy’s insight would surpass my own.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.148,id:UT22084-001-001-333}}}He shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahmanic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to Upatiṣya. When the young brahmin Upatiṣya taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite brahmanic mantras, he summarized the longer Vedas, abridging their words and phrases, and expanded on the shorter Vedas, explaining their meaning and etymologies. 
{{milestone:{label:1.149,id:UT22084-001-001-334}}}In the village of Kāṣṭhavāṭa, there lived a royal priest {{page:{number:29,id:UT22084-001-001-29069,folio:F.15.b}}} named Potalaka who was wealthy with many riches and goods, with holdings both vast and extensive, with riches to rival Vaiśravaṇa. He took a wife of equal caste and with her played, took pleasure, and amused himself. After their play, lovemaking, and the indulgence of all their desires resulted in no child, male or female, the childless couple, badly wanting a child, propitiated Śiva, Varuṇa, Kubera, Śakra, Brahmā, and others. Among the different gods were gods of park shrines, gods of the forest, gods of crossroads, gods of intersections, gods who take votive offerings, birth totem gods, gods who adhere to the Dharma, and gods who always shadow you. 
{{milestone:{label:1.150,id:UT22084-001-001-335}}} There is a saying, “Boys and girls are born in the world because they are prayed for.” But that is not so, for if it were, then each and every man would have a thousand sons, as do the kings of the world. Rather, boys and girls are born when three circumstances are present. What are those three? The mother and father feel desire and couple; it is the right time and the mother is ovulating; and a gandharva is near and wants to be reborn. And so it is that boys and girls are born when those three circumstances are present.{{note:{index83,id:UT22084-001-001-336}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.151,id:UT22084-001-001-337}}}As Potalaka sat engrossed in prayer, a being in search of his final rebirth, who had grasped the essence of liberation, who had turned to nirvāṇa and away from saṃsāra, who had seen that all births end in death, who did not seek to be reborn, and who was to take his last body, died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered his wife’s womb. 
{{milestone:{label:1.152,id:UT22084-001-001-338}}}Certain women, endowed with natural intelligence, have five unique qualities. What are the five? {{page:{number:30,id:UT22084-001-001-29070,folio:F.16.a}}} They know when a man feels desire and when he does not; they know when the time comes and when they are ovulating; they know when they have conceived; they know whence the conceived child came; and they know whether it is a boy or a girl. If it is a boy, he lies with his head to the right side of the womb. If it is a girl, she lies with her head to the left side of the womb. 
{{milestone:{label:1.153,id:UT22084-001-001-133516}}}Delighted, Potalaka’s wife joyfully told her husband, “Son of a lord! I am with child! And as it lies with its head to the right side of my womb, it is sure to be a boy, so pray be happy!”
{{milestone:{label:1.154,id:UT22084-001-001-340}}}Potalaka too was delighted. He sat straight up, raised his right hand, and exclaimed with great joy, “At last, I shall look on the face of the son I have wanted for so long! May we get along and not disagree. May he carry on my work and, having been nurtured, nurture in return. May he enjoy his inheritance and ensure that my line lasts long. When our time comes and we die, may he make the appropriate offerings, neither too few nor too many. And may he dedicate the merit he thus accrues to us by name, saying, ‘May this merit follow the two of them wherever they be born, wherever they go.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.155,id:UT22084-001-001-341}}}Knowing she was with child, to ensure she carried the child to term he installed his wife on the top story of their mansion where he saw that she was tended to and did not come to harm. When it was cold, she was given what she needed for the cold. When it was hot, she was given what she needed for the heat. On the doctor’s advice, her food was not to be too bitter, too sour, too salty, too sweet, too spicy, or too astringent; and so she was given food that was not bitter, sour, salty, sweet, spicy, or astringent. Her body was festooned in garlands, necklaces, and jewelry, like a goddess at play in a garden. {{page:{number:31,id:UT22084-001-001-29071,folio:F.16.b}}} She moved from bed to throne, from pedestal to pedestal, the soles of her feet never touching the floor, and she never heard anything even slightly unpleasant. 
{{milestone:{label:1.156,id:UT22084-001-001-342}}}After eight or nine months had passed, a boy was born, well proportioned, pleasing to the eye, handsome, radiant, with a golden complexion, a head shaped well like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that met, and a prominent nose. Three weeks or twenty-one days after the birth, relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style, during which time they chose a name for the boy. As this boy had come to them from the lap of the gods, they thought the young brahmin should be named Kolita (Born from the Lap), and so he was named Kolita.
{{milestone:{label:1.157,id:UT22084-001-001-343}}}Also, because he was a descendent of Mudgala, they thought the young brahmin should be named Maudgalyāyana (Son of Mudgala’s descendants), and so he was named Maudgalyāyana. 
{{milestone:{label:1.158,id:UT22084-001-001-2901}}} Thus it was that some knew the young brahmin as Maudgalyāyana while others knew him as Kolita. 
{{milestone:{label:1.159,id:UT22084-001-001-344}}}The young brahmin Kolita  was entrusted to eight nursemaids: two to cuddle him, two to breastfeed him, two to change his diapers, and two to play with him.{{note:{index84,id:UT22084-001-001-2902}}} Fortified with milk, curd, butter, ghee, cream, and other nourishing foods, he grew quickly, shooting up like a lotus in a pond.  When he was old enough, he was introduced to letters, number names, calculation, counting by hand, and how to exclude, to add, to leave, and to parse.  Once he had finished letters, he was instructed in the ways of brahmins: their conduct, ritual purity, and observances; {{page:{number:32,id:UT22084-001-001-29072,folio:F.17.a}}} the handling of ashes, the handling of ritual vases, and the handling of sites; hand gestures, turbans, offering praise, and salutations; the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda, the Sāmaveda, and the Atharvaveda; and a brahmin’s six duties—making fire sacrifices, officiating over fire sacrifices, studying, teaching, giving, and receiving. He mastered and became learned in the Vedas and all branches of Vedic knowledge. The Vedas and the limbs of the Vedas were entrusted to him, and with his blazing intelligence, he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others.
{{milestone:{label:1.160,id:UT22084-001-001-345}}}His father made him study all fields of knowledge. Once, when he was reciting the Vedas with his father, he asked, “Father, what does this statement mean?”
“Son, even I don’t know the meaning of this statement. Sages of the past recited with praise, sung, and furnished these sacred mantra, but nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.161,id:UT22084-001-001-347}}}“Father, do you think there is no meaning to these sacred mantra, which have been recited with praise, sung, and furnished by past sages, but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins? This is what such statements mean,” and he proceeded to explain.
{{milestone:{label:1.162,id:UT22084-001-001-133517}}}Potalaka was delighted and in his delight thought, “This is what a son should do: he should carry on his father’s tradition or develop his insight even further. Were he to accomplish only that, this brahmin boy’s insight would surpass my own.”
{{milestone:{label:1.163,id:UT22084-001-001-349}}}Potalaka shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahmanic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to Maudgalyāyana. The young brahmin Maudgalyāyana then taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite the brahmanic mantras.
{{milestone:{label:1.164,id:UT22084-001-001-351}}}The five hundred young brahmins were in the habit, {{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-001-001-29073,folio:F.17.b}}} when not occupied with their studies, of going to the riverbank to bathe, visiting the city, or collecting wood for use in fire pūjas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.165,id:UT22084-001-001-133518}}}Once, when not occupied with their studies, the students of the young brahmin Upatiṣya walked, reciting mantras on their way to the city. Meanwhile, trailing behind, the students of the young brahmin Maudgalyāyana walked, reciting mantras on their way to the city. When the students of the young brahmin Maudgalyāyana heard the students of the young brahmin Upatiṣya reciting the sacred mantra, they asked, “Why do you recite the sacred mantra in such a debased way?”
{{milestone:{label:1.166,id:UT22084-001-001-133519}}}“How should they be recited?”
“The sacred mantra should be recited as we do.”
{{milestone:{label:1.167,id:UT22084-001-001-354}}}“From whom did you learn these sacred mantra?”
“Not to know him is not to know the sun or the moon. In the village of Nālada lives the brahmin Tiṣya. We have learned them from his son, the young brahmin Upatiṣya. And from whom did you learn these sacred mantra?”
{{milestone:{label:1.168,id:UT22084-001-001-133520}}} “Not to know him is not to know the sun or the moon. In the village of Kāṣṭhavāṭa, there lives a royal priest named Potalaka. We have learned them from his son, the young brahmin Kolita.”
{{milestone:{label:1.169,id:UT22084-001-001-357}}} With that, the young brahmin students of Upatiṣya became dispirited, upset, and daunted. They went to Upatiṣya, who saw them off in the distance and asked, “What troubles you, young brahmins? Your preceptor is never wrong.”
{{milestone:{label:1.170,id:UT22084-001-001-359}}}Then he spoke in verse: {{page:{number:34,id:UT22084-001-001-29074,folio:F.18.a}}}
“Those things you feel from within
Are clearly seen from without.
You cannot mask your voice,
Your complexion, or your mien.
{{milestone:{label:1.171,id:UT22084-001-001-360}}}“Young brahmins, clearly something troubles you.”
After they explained the situation at length, Upatiṣya said, “Young brahmins, allow me to explain. Although the sacred mantra should be recited in the manner those young brahmins recite them, I have summarized the longer Vedas, abridging their words and phrases, and expanded on the shorter Vedas, explaining their meaning and etymologies.”
{{milestone:{label:1.172,id:UT22084-001-001-362}}}The students of Kolita had also become dispirited, upset, and daunted. They went to Kolita, who too, on seeing them off in the distance, asked, “What troubles you, young brahmins? Your preceptor is never wrong.”
{{milestone:{label:1.173,id:UT22084-001-001-364}}}He too then spoke the verse:
“Those things you feel from within

You cannot mask your voice,
Your complexion, or your mien.
{{milestone:{label:1.174,id:UT22084-001-001-365}}}“Young brahmins, clearly something troubles you.” 
After they explained the situation at length, he said, “Young brahmins, allow me to explain. Although the sacred mantra should be recited in the manner we have recited them, that young brahmin Upatiṣya is wise for he has he summarized the longer Vedas, abridging their words and phrases, and expanded on the shorter Vedas, explaining their meaning and etymologies.”
{{milestone:{label:1.175,id:UT22084-001-001-367}}}On hearing of the other, both Kolita and Upatiṣya formed a singular desire to meet the other. Upatiṣya went to his father and said, “Father, I {{page:{number:35,id:UT22084-001-001-29075,folio:F.18.b}}} wish to visit the village of Kāṣṭhavāṭa, for there lives a royal priest named Potalaka whose son is called Kolita. I shall go to see him.”
{{milestone:{label:1.176,id:UT22084-001-001-368}}}“Son, is he wiser than you?”
“Father, he is not wiser than I. It is rather that he is wealthier.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.177,id:UT22084-001-001-371}}}His father replied:
“Some are greater due to pedigree,
Others because of age or riches.
But they all seek to sit
At the doorstep of the learned.
{{milestone:{label:1.178,id:UT22084-001-001-372}}}“Son, if he should come here you should share your learning but you mustn’t go to him.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.179,id:UT22084-001-001-2904}}}Kolita also went to his father and said, “Father, I wish to visit the village of Nālada, for there lives a brahmin Tiṣya whose son is called Upatiṣya. I shall go to see him.”
{{milestone:{label:1.180,id:UT22084-001-001-374}}}“Son, is he wealthier than you?”
“Father, he is not wealthier than I. It is rather that he is wiser.”

{{milestone:{label:1.183,id:UT22084-001-001-2903}}}Some time later, in Rājagṛha, the feast day of the nāga kings Giri and Valguka approached. As the day neared, King Bimbisāra wondered whether he should join in the festivities himself, as was his wont, or send Prince Ajātaśatru in his stead. 
{{milestone:{label:1.184,id:UT22084-001-001-381}}}A short time later, a small task came up, prompting King Bimbisāra to say to Prince Ajātaśatru, “Son, go and join in the festivities for the nāga kings Giri and Valguka.”
{{milestone:{label:1.185,id:UT22084-001-001-133521}}} When the brahmin Potalaka heard that King Bimbisāra {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-001-001-29076,folio:F.19.a}}} had sent Prince Ajātaśatru to join in the festivities for the nāga kings Giri and Valguka, he thought, “Prince Ajātaśatru will become king once his father dies and Kolita will become royal priest when I die. Thus their acquaintance will in time bear fruit.”
{{milestone:{label:1.186,id:UT22084-001-001-383}}}He said to Kolita, “Son, go join the festivities for the nāga kings Giri and Valguka. There, they will have arranged four seats, one for the king, one for the royal priest, one for the challenger, and one for the reigning champion. Leave the king’s seat be, and take your place in the royal priest’s seat.”
On arriving, he left the king’s seat be and sat on the royal priest’s seat. 
{{milestone:{label:1.187,id:UT22084-001-001-385}}}When the brahmin Tiṣya heard that King Bimbisāra had sent Prince Ajātaśatru to join in the festivities for the nāga kings Giri and Valguka, he too said to Upatiṣya, “Son, go join the festivities for the nāga kings Giri and Valguka. There, they will have arranged four seats, one for the king, one for the royal priest, one for the challenger, and one for the reigning champion. Leave the king’s seat and the royal priest’s seat be, but place a small stick and vase on the reigning champion’s seat before sitting down on the challenger’s seat. From the time the sun rises to the time it sets, there shall be no challenger to equal you.”
{{milestone:{label:1.188,id:UT22084-001-001-386}}}When Upatiṣya arrived, he passed the king’s and the royal priest’s seats, placed a small stick and vase on the seat for the reigning champion, and sat down on the challenger’s seat. When the music began, the dancers sang in Toṭaka meter.{{note:{index85,id:UT22084-001-001-387}}} The people began to dance {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-001-001-29077,folio:F.19.b}}} and sing, while the two young brahmins sat in repose. When the great crowd of people saw this, they exclaimed, “Either those two young brahmins are fools or they’re unflappable!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.189,id:UT22084-001-001-388}}}As the music wound down and the people went off dancing and singing, Kolita asked Upatiṣya, “Did it seem to you that the dances were well danced, the songs well sung, and the music well played?”
Upatiṣya replied, “It seemed so to those who saw and heard them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.190,id:UT22084-001-001-390}}}“If it is true that those who withdraw into repose do not see, how then do they not hear?” asked Kolita.
{{milestone:{label:1.191,id:UT22084-001-001-392}}}Upatiṣya replied in verse:
“In a crowd of people destined for death,

Though their dead skin and dead flesh will die,
What wise man would not be vigilant?”

“People know me thus.”
“And you?” Upatiṣya asked Kolita. “Did it seem to you that the dances were well danced, the songs well sung, and the music well played?” {{note:{index86,id:UT22084-001-001-396}}}

“People know me thus.”
Upatiṣya said to Kolita,  “Come. Let us go forth from home into homelessness so that we may rely solely on what is correct.”

Having been born into a caste borne about by elephants, why would I renounce it?”
{{milestone:{label:1.197,id:UT22084-001-001-406}}}Upatiṣya recited a verse:
“When a tree rots,

 “I must first consult my parents,” replied Kolita.
The young brahmin Kolita went to his parents and said, “Father, Mother, please listen. As I have faith in only what is perfect, I shall go forth from home into homelessness.”

At that point Kolita’s parents went to him and said, “Dear boy, please listen. You are very young and have lived a life of leisure, and you do not know what it is to suffer. It is hard to live the holy life. It is hard to live in solitude. It is hard to be happy all on your own. It is hard to make your bed in distant forests, at the foot of mountains, and in remote places. Living alone in the wilderness is very trying. You will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals. You will have to spend the rest of your life living on others’ handouts. You will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures. You will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people. Dear boy! Kolita! Come home.

The wise have praised going forth, so if going forth makes him happy, then at least you will see him alive. If he isn’t happy, he can always give up the life of a sage.

{{milestone:{label:1.223,id:UT22084-001-001-133530}}}The venerable Śāriputra had gone forth in five hundred previous lives because he had made this prayer:
{{milestone:{label:1.224,id:UT22084-001-001-447}}}“May I be born, not in a wealthy house

With that they made their way to Rājagṛha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.226,id:UT22084-001-001-450}}}Meanwhile there were six tīrthika teachers living in Rājagṛha who entertained the conceit of omniscience although they were not omniscient: Pūraṇa Kāśyapa;  Gośālīputra, the wandering mendicant; Sañjayin, son of Vairaṭṭī; Ajita of the hair shawl; Kakuda, a descendant of Kātyāyana; and Jñātiputra, the Nirgrantha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.227,id:UT22084-001-001-451}}}The young brahmins Upatiṣya and Kolita went to Pūraṇa Kāśyapa and asked him, “Sir, what is your approach to the Dharma? What instructions do you give to your students? What is the result of living a holy life? What are its benefits?”
{{milestone:{label:1.228,id:UT22084-001-001-133531}}}“Young brahmins,” replied Pūraṇa, “this is how I see it and this is my philosophy: There is nothing to alms, oblations, fire sacrifices, good deeds, or bad deeds. There are no results or fruitions from performing good deeds or bad deeds. There is no present life. There is no afterlife. There is no mother. There is no father. Sentient beings are not born miraculously.{{note:{index87,id:UT22084-001-001-453}}} In the world {{page:{number:46,id:UT22084-001-001-29086,folio:F.24.a}}} there are no arhats who have reached perfection, who have entered perfection, who can knowingly say that through their heightened insight they have seen this and future lives, and proclaim,  ‘We have overcome birth. We have lived the holy life. We have done what needed to be done. We will know no life other than this.’  One’s life-force persists for the duration of this life but is annihilated after that. It will perish and after death will not arise again. A person’s body is forged from the four great elements, for once its time is up, the body’s solid structures recede{{note:{index88,id:UT22084-001-001-454}}} into earth, the body’s fluids recede into water, the body’s heat recedes into fire, and the body’s vital energies recede into wind. The senses fade into space. A person’s corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned, never to be seen again. What burns turns to ash. The bones turn a pigeon-like grey. Those who are confused about these things counsel giving alms, while the wise counsel receiving them. Those who argue that such things exist are all vainly debating what is empty and hollow. Both the childish and the wise will cease to be. They will perish and after death will not live again.”
{{milestone:{label:1.229,id:UT22084-001-001-455}}} The young brahmins Upatiṣya and Kolita thought, “This noble teacher has strayed onto a spurious path. He pursues fully a ruinous path. This is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected.”
{{milestone:{label:1.230,id:UT22084-001-001-457}}}Knowing this, they spoke in verse:

That sentient beings acquire understanding and insight has nothing to do with causes and conditions. Their acquisition of understanding and insight occurs randomly and by chance.

It is not due to a combination of a person’s skill and overpowering ability. It is not due to one’s own skill. It is not due to another’s skill. It is not due to a combination of one’s own skill and another’s skill. All beings, all living things, and all elements are powerless. They lack strength, influence, determination, and the ability to overcome.  A being’s life is predetermined. That is why we experience the unique pleasures and pains of each of the six realms.”

{{milestone:{label:1.240,id:UT22084-001-001-475}}}“Young brahmins,” replied Ajita, “this is how I see it and this is my philosophy: Seven bodies are not products, they are not by-products, they are not apparitions, they are not by-products of apparitions, they are not subject to harm, they are everlasting, and they are still and solid like a pillar. {{page:{number:50,id:UT22084-001-001-29090,folio:F.26.a}}} What are the seven? The seven are thus: the body of earth, the body of water, the body of fire, the body of wind, pleasure, pain, and the vitality of life. Those seven bodies are not products, are not by-products, are not apparitions, are not by-products of apparitions, are not subject to harm, are everlasting, and are still and solid like a pillar. Those seven are such that they do not waver, they do not change, nor do they harm one another, nor do they become merit, nor do they become sin, nor do they become both merit and sin, nor do they become pleasure, nor do they become pain, nor do they become both pleasure and pain.  Were one person to cut off the head of another person, even that would not influence the world nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solid, for the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies, leaving the life within them unharmed. There is absolutely no killing them, no making to kill them, no rousing them, no making to rouse them, no awareness of them, no making to be aware of them, no knowing them, and no making them known. Whether you be childish or wise, you are liberated from suffering after 8,400,000 eons; in the meantime, you are reborn in and cycle through 14,000 principal places of rebirth, 60,600 great eons, five types of actions, three types of actions, two types of actions, action, half-actions, sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate eons, thirty-six hells, one hundred and twenty senses, sixty-two constituent particles, 49,000 classes of nāga families, 49,000 classes of garuḍa, 49,000 classes of wandering mendicants, {{page:{number:51,id:UT22084-001-001-29091,folio:F.26.b}}} 49,000 classes of ājivika, 49,000 classes of nirgrantha, seven realms with discerning awareness, seven realms lacking discerning awareness, seven nirgrantha realms, seven demi-god realms, seven demonic realms, seven godly realms, seven human realms, seven great oceans, seven hundred lakes, seven great dreams, seven hundred dreams, seven states of great diminishment, seven hundred states of diminishment, seven states of great increase, seven hundred states of increase, seven states of great depletion, seven hundred states of depletion, seven great abysses, seven hundred abysses, six noble clans, ten high-status rebirths, and the eight grounds of a great person. Thus, just as a ball of thread thrown in the air unravels into a long thread as it falls, everyone, be they childish or wise, is liberated from suffering after having been through the cycle of rebirth for 8,400,000 eons. No ascetic or brahmin can say, ‘By observing ethics, a vow, asceticism, or celibacy, I shall bring to fruition those acts that have not borne fruit, and in facing those acts that have borne fruit, purify them.’ Our pleasures and pains are predestined. It is impossible to extend or reduce them. As this is how things are and not otherwise, the rounds of existence are thus to be counted.”

When actions are exhausted, suffering is exhausted. When suffering is exhausted, one is freed from suffering.”
{{milestone:{label:1.249,id:UT22084-001-001-488}}}Upatiṣya and Kolita {{page:{number:54,id:UT22084-001-001-29094,folio:F.28.a}}} thought, “This noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path. He pursues fully a ruinous path. This is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected.”
Knowing this, they spoke in verse:
{{milestone:{label:1.250,id:UT22084-001-001-490}}}“He who teaches a wrong and ruinous path
Is known to be an inferior teacher. 
If this is his Dharma,
What, for him, is antithetical to Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:1.251,id:UT22084-001-001-491}}}The Nirgrantha’s teaching heard, they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on. 
{{milestone:{label:1.252,id:UT22084-001-001-493}}}Not long before, word had spread about a tīrthika named Sañjayin. The young brahmins Upatiṣya and Kolita went to where the teacher Sañjayin lived and asked, “Gentlemen, where is the teacher Sañjayin?”
“He has withdrawn into seclusion.”
“Oh! This is the first time we’ve heard the phrase ‘withdrawn into seclusion’ in such a long time!”
They thought, “It would not be right to disturb the teacher’s withdrawal into seclusion. We will approach him once he has risen from this state.” And with that they sat off to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.253,id:UT22084-001-001-497}}}The teacher Sañjayin emerged from seclusion. The states of absorption he had experienced had invigorated his senses. Upatiṣya and Kolita thought, “Whoever has such a face must have qualities to match.” They approached him and asked, “Sir Sañjayin, what is your approach to the Dharma? What instructions do you give to your students? What is the result of living the holy life? What are its benefits?”
Sañjayin replied, “Young brahmins, this is how I see it and this is my philosophy: The Dharma is truth and non-violence. The peaceful, ageless, immortal, and unwaning {{page:{number:55,id:UT22084-001-001-29095,folio:F.28.b}}} state is Brahman.”
{{milestone:{label:1.254,id:UT22084-001-001-498}}}The two replied, “Preceptor, what is the meaning of what you have said?”
“As for truth, renunciation is born of true thoughts. As for non-violence, all dharmas spring from the ground of non-violence. The peaceful, ageless, immortal, and unwaning state are other names by which nirvāṇa may be known. That state is called Brahmā, for if some were to achieve nirvāṇa in this very life, all would be well. But even if they did not achieve it, they would still draw near to the world of Brahmā. Even so, brahmins will be reborn in the world of Brahmā, will alight into the world of Brahmā, will have alighted into the world of Brahmā. And how is the world of Brahmā? Gaining the fortune for the world of Brahmā is akin to entering nirvāṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:1.255,id:UT22084-001-001-500}}}“Preceptor, allow us to go forth. We pledge to live the holy life under your guidance.” And with that the two became renunciants in Sañjayin’s order.
After the teacher Sañjayin allowed Upatiṣya and Kolita’s going forth, the news of their acceptance spread everywhere and Sañjayin was lauded with many accolades and much praise. He thought,  “If I was a member of the Śāṇḍilya clan{{note:{index92,id:UT22084-001-001-502}}} before and am still a member now, what has caused such abundant accolades and praise to come to me now?”
{{milestone:{label:1.256,id:UT22084-001-001-503}}}Sañjayin thought, “It is not due to my own sway. Rather, it is the sway of these two young brahmins.” 
Thus when he accepted five hundred young brahmins for instruction in how to recite brahmanic mantras, he assigned two hundred and fifty to Upatiṣya and two hundred and fifty to Kolita. {{page:{number:56,id:UT22084-001-001-29096,folio:F.29.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.257,id:UT22084-001-001-505}}}At one point, after the teacher Sañjayin had fallen ill, Upatiṣya asked Kolita, “Kolita, will you attend the preceptor or will you seek out medicine for him?”
Kolita thought, “Upatiṣya is intelligent. I would have him attend the preceptor while I go in search of medicine,” and said, “Please attend the preceptor and I will seek medicine.”
{{milestone:{label:1.258,id:UT22084-001-001-507}}}Upatiṣya began to attend the preceptor and Kolita went off in search of medicine. Though Upatiṣya ministered to the preceptor with medicinal roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruit, the illness would not subside. Though weak, the preceptor smiled, prompting Upatiṣya to ask, “Preceptor, given that great people like you do not smile for no reason, what causes you to smile? What prompts it?”
{{milestone:{label:1.259,id:UT22084-001-001-508}}}“Upatiṣya,” replied Sañjayin, “allow me to explain. Great beings like me do not smile without cause or condition. I was thinking about the wife of King Suvarṇapati of Suvarṇadvīpa. When her husband’s time had come, she leapt onto his funeral pyre. I was thinking how the impulse to desire, the very things desired, and the pursuit of desire are what cause these sentient beings to suffer.”
{{milestone:{label:1.260,id:UT22084-001-001-509}}}“When was this, preceptor?”
“At such and such a time, a long time ago.”
“In what month?”
“In such and such a month long ago.”
“On what day?”
“On such and such a day long ago.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.261,id:UT22084-001-001-515}}}Sañjayin recorded this conversation on a board and set it down.
“Preceptor,” Upatiṣya urged, “if the whole of what little renunciation we have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosia, and if you, preceptor, have found some small measure of that ambrosia then please share it with us!”
{{milestone:{label:1.262,id:UT22084-001-001-517}}}“Son, {{page:{number:57,id:UT22084-001-001-29097,folio:F.29.b}}} the whole of what little renunciation I have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosia but neither have I discovered even a small measure of that ambrosia. Allow me to explain. On the fifteenth, a day of fast, I heard the gods, who were passing through the heavens above, say, ‘At the foot of the snow mountains, on the banks of the river Bhāgīrathī, not far from the sage Kapila’s hermitage, a youth from the Śākya clan has appeared. Brahmins skilled in interpreting omens and signs made this prophecy: ‘The youth installed in the palace will either become king of the world, with his reign extending over the four directions, or he will become a king of Dharma. He will be endowed with the Dharma or the seven precious emblems. The seven precious emblems he will possess are as follows: a precious wheel, a precious elephant, a precious horse, a precious jewel, a precious woman, a precious steward, and a precious general. He will have a full one thousand sons, heroic, brave, and of ideal build who will destroy enemy forces. Under him, the whole earth, from sea to sea, will be free from the threat of harm and violence, and will be a realm without punishment or armed expulsion, where rule is impartial and in harmony with the Dharma. But if he, with perfect faith, should cut his hair, shave his beard, don the saffron robes, and go forth from home into homelessness, then he shall become a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened buddha, famed all over the world.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.263,id:UT22084-001-001-518}}}“ ‘You two should go forth into his teachings. Having gone forth, you should not proclaim your caste, you should not proclaim your clan, you should not proclaim your being a young brahmin.  Once you have overcome conceit and pride, you should live the holy life under his guidance and then you will receive a great ambrosia.”
Then he said,
{{milestone:{label:1.264,id:UT22084-001-001-520}}}“All accumulation ends in depletion; {{page:{number:58,id:UT22084-001-001-29098,folio:F.30.a}}}
The lofty in the end will fall; 
All meetings end in separation;
All life ends in death.”
{{milestone:{label:1.265,id:UT22084-001-001-521}}}On saying that, he went the way of all temporal phenomena. After decorating the sides of his bier with blue, yellow, red, and white cloth, they carried his corpse to the charnel ground and cremated him. In time, their grief subsided. 
In time, a young brahmin named Suvarṇajaṭa from Suvarṇadvīpa arrived in Rājagṛha. When he entered their dwelling, Upatiṣya asked, “Young brahmin, where have you come from?”
“From Suvarṇadvīpa,” he replied.
{{milestone:{label:1.266,id:UT22084-001-001-524}}}“Young brahmin, did you see anything at all amazing or remarkable in Suvarṇadvīpa?”
“I didn’t see anything truly amazing or remarkable,” he replied, “but I did see something somewhat amazing and remarkable so listen as you please. The wife of King Suvarṇapati of Suvarṇadvīpa leapt onto his funeral pyre when her husband’s time had come.”
{{milestone:{label:1.267,id:UT22084-001-001-526}}}“When was this?”
“At such and such a time, a long time ago.”

“In such and such a month long ago.”

“On such and such a day long ago.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.270,id:UT22084-001-001-532}}}When Upatiṣya looked at the conversation recorded on the board, he saw that everything was exactly as Sañjayin had said, at which point he said to Kolita, “Our preceptor Sañjayin concealed his learning from us. If he had found such rare ambrosia, he did not share it with us. For if he himself saw forms in other lands with the divine eye and heard pleasant sounds with the divine ear, then his claim to have found no ambrosia is not true.”
{{milestone:{label:1.271,id:UT22084-001-001-533}}} Kolita thought, “Upatiṣya is intelligent. Were he to find such ambrosia he may not tell me and a situation such as this might happen again.” 
Then he said, “Upatiṣya, join me in a pledge. Whoever finds such ambrosia first, {{page:{number:59,id:UT22084-001-001-29099,folio:F.30.b}}} he shall share it with the other.”
They made the pledge and set out into the realm.

{{milestone:{label:1.272,id:UT22084-001-001-536}}}When the blessed Bodhisattva reached the age of twenty-nine, he ceased to revel in desires, for the sight of the elderly, the sick, and the dead had moved him deeply. He stole out in the middle of the night and fled into the forest, where he spent six years practicing austerities. But he came to see that those austerities would amount to nothing. He then breathed freely, in and out, and partook again of solid foods such as rice and porridge. He rubbed ghee and oil into his skin and took refreshing baths in warm water.  When he came to the village of Senānī, the village headman’s daughters, Nandā and Nandabalā, gave him milk that had been churned sixteen times and mixed with honey to drink. He was lauded by the nāga king Kālika, and he accepted a bundle of auspicious golden-colored kūśa grass from a grassmonger. From there he went to what would be the site of his awakening. He arrived and settled cross-legged into an unshakable absorption on an unshakable bed of kuśa grass. Sitting straight and erect, he settled his mind and said: 
{{milestone:{label:1.273,id:UT22084-001-001-537}}}“I shall not uncross my legs
Until I have achieved the undefiled state.”
{{milestone:{label:1.274,id:UT22084-001-001-538}}}His intention pledged, he said:

At Brahmā’s request, he went to Vārāṇasī and turned the wheel of Dharma, revealing in three phases a teaching with twelve aspects.{{note:{index93,id:UT22084-001-001-2906}}} During that time, he converted the group of five, the five friends,{{note:{index94,id:UT22084-001-001-2908}}} and fifty high-born village brahmin youths, who then went forth and received full ordination. {{page:{number:60,id:UT22084-001-001-29100,folio:F.31.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.276,id:UT22084-001-001-541}}}While passing through the Karpāsī forest, he convinced a noble band of sixty youths of the truths. While passing through the village of Senānī, he convinced the village headman’s daughters, Nandā and Nandabalā, of the truths. While passing through Uruvilvā, he inspired a group of one thousand dreadlocked ascetics to go forth, and ordained them. While passing by the Gayāśīrṣa stūpa, he instructed those one thousand monks by displaying three miracles, thereby freeing them from the wilds of saṃsāra and establishing them in the utterly final state of perfection and the unsurpassably blissful state of nirvāṇa. While passing through the Yaṣtī forest, he brought the King of Magadha, Bimbisāra of the Guilds, to the truths along with 80,000 gods and many hundreds of thousands of Magadhan brahmins and householders. While passing through Rājagṛha, he accepted the offering of a bamboo park. It was then that the Blessed Buddha took up residence at the Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagṛha’s Bamboo Park.
{{milestone:{label:1.277,id:UT22084-001-001-543}}}Having set out into the realm, Upatiṣya and Kolita also arrived in Rājagṛha. They saw that Rājagṛha was utterly still and thought, “One of only two things could have brought utter quiet to this town: either fear of neighboring armies, or the presence of several ascetics and brahmins famed for their merit and majesty.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.278,id:UT22084-001-001-544}}}As they began to examine the stars, they acknowledged, “As neighboring armies present no imminent danger, tomorrow we shall know more.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.279,id:UT22084-001-001-546}}}The two were in the habit of daubing three lines of ash across their foreheads and going out on their daily rounds. When they did so, many hundreds of thousands of creatures would always follow after them. 
The next day they daubed three lines of ash across their foreheads and went out on their daily rounds. However, on that day not a single being {{page:{number:61,id:UT22084-001-001-29101,folio:F.31.b}}} followed after them. On returning they considered the matter. They saw that not a single being had followed after them and wondered, “In the past when we have gone out on rounds, many hundreds of thousands of creatures would follow after us. Why then has not a single being followed after us today?”
{{milestone:{label:1.280,id:UT22084-001-001-547}}}There is nothing, even in the slightest, the blessed buddhas do not know, do not see, are not aware of, or do not notice.

Tathāgatas too hold dear

An omniscient mind’s compassion never wanes

With this eye, the Blessed One saw that the minds of the wandering mendicants Upatiṣya and Kolita had been ripened through their service to past buddhas and the stores of virtue they had amassed, {{page:{number:63,id:UT22084-001-001-29103,folio:F.32.b}}} and thus he understood that the two wandering mendicants were like fruit ripe for the plucking. The time to train them had come. The Blessed One thought, “Will these two be captivated by the Teacher or by his disciples?” and saw they would be captivated by disciples.
{{milestone:{label:1.284,id:UT22084-001-001-555}}}He thought, “What will be their way into the renunciant order? Will they be drawn by miracles or by conduct?” Thinking that, he saw they would be drawn by conduct. The Blessed One summoned the venerable Aśvajit, whose conduct he saw would captivate them, for conduct like his captivated gods and men. Then the Blessed One instructed the venerable Aśvajit, “Aśvajit, consider the wandering mendicants Upatiṣya and Kolita.”
{{milestone:{label:1.285,id:UT22084-001-001-556}}}Aśvajit’s silence indicated his assent to the Blessed One’s instruction. As Aśvajit was fully committed to acting on the Blessed One’s instruction, he praised and welcomed the Blessed One’s instruction. Bowing his head at the Blessed One’s feet, he said, “I go with the Blessed One’s guidance.”
{{milestone:{label:1.286,id:UT22084-001-001-557}}}Early the next morning, after the night had passed, the venerable Aśvajit put on his under robe and took up his begging bowl and robes.

On seeing him he thought, “So this is what the renunciants who come to live here in Rājagṛha are like. Never in my life have I seen anyone carry himself like this renunciant.

Upatiṣya saw the Dharma, heard the Dharma, knew the Dharma, plumbed the depths of the Dharma, overcame his skepticism, transcended doubt, could not be swayed by others, and was not reliant on others. With his newfound fearless confidence in the Dharma taught by the Teacher, he stood up from his seat, pulled his shawl from one shoulder, bowed to the venerable Aśvajit with his palms pressed together, and spoke in verse:

At the time, the venerable Aśvajit was seated, taking shelter from the sun at the foot of a tree. The wandering mendicants Upatiṣya and Kolita saw the venerable Aśvajit from a long way off.

Do you see Upatiṣya and Kolita, or do you see venerable ones? These two will become my disciples, my foremost and noblest pair, for one shall become the greatest of miracle workers, and the other shall become the wisest of the wise.”

{{milestone:{label:1.421,id:UT22084-001-001-777}}}In the time of the Blessed Buddha, one received the going forth, ordination, and monkhood in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya in the following way: the Blessed Buddha allowed the postulants’ going forth and ordained them with the words, “Come, monk.” Thus when a person approached a monk with the wish to go forth, the postulant was led before the Blessed One, knowing that when the Blessed One said, “Come, monk,’ he received the going forth, ordination, and monkhood in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya.{{note:{index117,id:UT22084-001-001-778}}}{{page:{number:93,id:UT22084-001-001-29133,folio:F.47.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.422,id:UT22084-001-001-779}}}However, there came a case in which one postulant, while coming to see the Blessed One, died on the way and thus was prevented from  receiving the going forth, ordination, and monkhood in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya.  When the monks asked the Blessed One about it, he thought, “Alas! For those disciples who live a great distance away, the journey can be arduous.” He then said, “In light of what has happened, from this day forward, I permit the saṅgha to allow going forth and grant ordination.” 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-1}}}The Early Rite
{{milestone:{label:1.423,id:UT22084-001-001-781}}}Although the Blessed One had decreed, “The saṅgha should allow going forth and grant ordination, they did not know how to do that. So the monks asked the Blessed One about it, and he said, “If a person approaches a monk wishing to go forth, the monk should accept him. Once this is done and the entire saṅgha has assembled, the postulant should don the robes and prostrate to his seniors. The postulant should then kneel with palms joined and ask the saṅgha three times, after which the monk petitioner makes a motion to ratify the motion. The postulant’s going forth is allowed and he is ordained the moment this very act whose fourth member is a motion is accepted.” 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-1-1}}}The postulant’s request
{{milestone:{label:1.424,id:UT22084-001-001-783}}}The postulant would make the following request:
“Revered saṅgha, please listen. I, [postulant’s name], ask the saṅgha to allow my going forth and grant ordination into the monkhood. {{page:{number:94,id:UT22084-001-001-29134,folio:F.48.a}}} I ask that the compassionate and reverend saṅgha, out of compassion, allow my going forth and confer ordination on me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.425,id:UT22084-001-001-133445}}}This would be repeated a second and a third time. 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-1-2}}}The monk’s request
{{milestone:{label:1.426,id:UT22084-001-001-787}}}After that, one monk would act on the request. While seated he would say the following: 
“Revered saṅgha, please listen. [Postulant’s name] has asked the saṅgha to allow his going forth and grant ordination into the monkhood. If the time is right and the saṅgha can accept it, I ask that the saṅgha grant their consent. I ask that the saṅgha allow [postulant’s name] to go forth and grant him ordination.”
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-1-3}}}Acting on the motion
{{milestone:{label:1.427,id:UT22084-001-001-790}}}The request would be acted on in the following way: 
“Revered saṅgha, please listen. [Postulant’s name] has asked the saṅgha to allow his going forth and grant ordination into the monkhood. If the saṅgha allows his going forth and grants ordination, then I ask that any who can allow the going forth of the venerable [postulant’s name] and his ordination remain silent. I ask that any who cannot accept it speak up.”
{{milestone:{label:1.428,id:UT22084-001-001-792}}} After the first motion to act, the motion would be repeated a second and a third time. The saṅgha would acknowledge its acceptance and give its consent that the going forth of such and such a monk be allowed and that he be granted ordination by remaining silent.
{{milestone:{label:1.429,id:UT22084-001-001-133446}}} Thus went the Early Rite. 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-2}}}Preceptors and Instructors
{{milestone:{label:1.430,id:UT22084-001-001-795}}}Because those whose going forth was allowed and who were ordained under the Early Rite had no preceptor or instructor, they would go to the homes of brahmins and householders without being well washed or well dressed, while speaking shrilly and in loud voices, and behaving wildly. While there, they would beg for food, implore others to beg for food, grovel for soup, implore others to grovel for soup, and do still more that went against the teachings. {{page:{number:95,id:UT22084-001-001-29135,folio:F.48.b}}}
This prompted tīrthikas, knowledgeable men, and others to criticize, disparage, and slander them. They would say, “Since these ascetic sons of the Śākya have no preceptor and no instructor, they go to the houses of brahmins and householders without being well washed or well dressed, while speaking shrilly and in loud voices, and behaving wildly. While there, they beg for food, implore others to beg for food, grovel for soup, and implore others to grovel for soup. Who would give these shaven-headed ascetics alms or think to help them?”
{{milestone:{label:1.431,id:UT22084-001-001-796}}}One sick monk even died for lack of someone to nurse him. When that occurred, the monks asked the Blessed One about it, and the Blessed One thought, “I should permit my disciples to act as preceptors and instructors, so that they may allow others to go forth and care for the sick among them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.432,id:UT22084-001-001-797}}}The Blessed One proclaimed, “After considering the matter, I permit preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordination.”
When the Blessed One had permitted preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordination, the monks found themselves in a quandary, for they did not know what serving as a preceptor or instructor entailed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.433,id:UT22084-001-001-799}}}So the Blessed One proclaimed, “There are five types of instructors and two types of preceptors. What are these five types of instructors? They are instructors of novices, privy advisors, officiants, givers of instruction,{{note:{index118,id:UT22084-001-001-800}}} and recitation instructors. What is an instructor of novices? He is one who grants refuge and the foundations of the training.{{note:{index119,id:UT22084-001-001-801}}} What is a privy advisor? He is one who inquires into private matters. What is an officiant? He is one who moves to act upon an act whose fourth member is a motion. What is a giver of refuge? He is one in whose presence you stay even for a single day. {{page:{number:96,id:UT22084-001-001-29136,folio:F.49.a}}} What is a recitation instructor? He is one who recites even a single verse of four lines three times, which you then repeat. What are the two types of preceptor? They are those who allow going forth and those who grant ordination.”
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3}}}The Present Day Ordination Rite
{{milestone:{label:1.434,id:UT22084-001-001-803}}}When the Blessed One permitted preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordination, the monks found themselves in a quandary, for they did not know how to do that. So the Blessed One proclaimed, “If someone approaches you with the wish to go forth, you should ascertain whether he has any impediments by questioning him. Having ascertained this, he should be given the layperson’s vows by having him go for refuge to the Three Jewels and promise to live as a lay brother.” 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-1}}}Giving the layperson’s vows and refuge precepts
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-1-1}}}How to give the layperson’s vows
{{milestone:{label:1.435,id:UT22084-001-001-806}}}This is how to give the layperson’s vows. First, the postulant should prostrate to the Teacher.{{note:{index120,id:UT22084-001-001-807}}} Then, once he has been made to prostrate, have him kneel before the instructor, join his palms together, and say:
{{milestone:{label:1.436,id:UT22084-001-001-808}}}“Reverend, heed me. I, [postulant’s name], will henceforth, for as long as I live, seek refuge in the Buddha, supreme among men; I will seek refuge in the Dharma, supreme among all that is free from attachment; I will seek refuge in the Saṅgha, supreme among communities. For as long as I live, I ask that you, reverend, accept me as a lay brother.”
{{milestone:{label:1.437,id:UT22084-001-001-809}}}The postulant repeats this a second and a third time, but in the third recitation, should say “instructor.”{{note:{index121,id:UT22084-001-001-810}}} The instructor then says:
“This is the method.”
{{milestone:{label:1.438,id:UT22084-001-001-811}}}At which point the lay devotee says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.439,id:UT22084-001-001-133479}}}That is the giving of the layperson’s vows.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-1-2}}}Pledging to keep the precepts
{{milestone:{label:1.440,id:UT22084-001-001-815}}}The postulant then expresses his commitment to the precepts with the following words:
“Instructor, heed me. Just as noble arhats renounced killing and swore to refrain from killing for as long as they lived, so do I, {{page:{number:97,id:UT22084-001-001-29137,folio:F.49.b}}} [postulant’s name], henceforth, for as long as I live, renounce killing and swear to refrain from killing. With this first branch, I pledge to train in, practice, and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats. Furthermore, noble arhats renounced and swore to refrain from stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its by-products, which leave one uninhibited. Just so do I, [postulant’s name], too, for as long as I live, renounce and swear to refrain from stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its by-products, which leave one uninhibited. With this, the fifth branch, I pledge to train in, practice, and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats.”
{{milestone:{label:1.441,id:UT22084-001-001-817}}}The instructor then says:
“This is the method.”
{{milestone:{label:1.442,id:UT22084-001-001-133447}}}At which point the lay devotee says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.443,id:UT22084-001-001-133448}}}This completes the layperson’s induction rite.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-2}}}Going forth
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-2-1}}}Informing the saṅgha of the wish to go forth
{{milestone:{label:1.444,id:UT22084-001-001-824}}}The postulant should then be directed to the monk petitioner. The monk petitioner asks the preceptor:
“Have you inquired into the private matters?”
A breach occurs if he makes a petition without inquiring. 
{{milestone:{label:1.445,id:UT22084-001-001-827}}}The monk petitioner then petitions the saṅgha in the following way. Having laid out sitting mats, he strikes the gaṇḍī beam. Once he has informed the monks with a response to their queries, the entire saṅgha sits; either together in consensus or each in his own dwelling. The postulant is then made to prostrate to the seniormost in the saṅgha before taking his place in a kneeling position, {{page:{number:98,id:UT22084-001-001-29138,folio:F.50.a}}} with palms pressed together. The monk petitioner then addresses the saṅgha with these words:
{{milestone:{label:1.446,id:UT22084-001-001-828}}}“I ask you, reverend saṅgha, to listen. The postulant [postulant’s name] has asked the preceptor [preceptor’s name] to allow his going forth. He wants to leave the householder’s life, with its white clothes and unshaven head and face, and go forth in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya. [Postulant’s name] wants to go forth and, having shaven head and face, to don the saffron robes. He wants to go forth from home into homelessness under the guidance of this preceptor [preceptor’s name] so that he may rely solely on what is right. And if indeed he too is without impediments, should he be allowed to go forth?”
{{milestone:{label:1.447,id:UT22084-001-001-829}}}The whole saṅgha should reply:
“If he is without impediment, he should be allowed.”
If they say that, then all is well. A breach occurs if they do not. 
{{milestone:{label:1.448,id:UT22084-001-001-133441}}}That is how one informs the saṅgha of the wish to go forth.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-2-2}}}Requesting the preceptor
{{milestone:{label:1.449,id:UT22084-001-001-833}}}Next, a request is made to the preceptor. The request should be made in the following way. The postulant is made to prostrate to and then kneel before the preceptor. With palms pressed together, he should say:
“Instructor, heed me. I, [postulant’s name], ask you, instructor, to serve as preceptor. Instructor, please act as my preceptor. Instructor, as preceptor, please allow my going forth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.450,id:UT22084-001-001-835}}}He repeats this a second and a third time, but the third time he should say “preceptor” in place of “instructor.” The preceptor then says:
“This is the method.”
To which the person wishing to go forth says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.451,id:UT22084-001-001-133468}}}That is the request to the preceptor.
{{milestone:{label:1.452,id:UT22084-001-001-839}}}The postulant should then be entrusted to a monk who will shave the postulant’s hair and beard. The Blessed One decreed, “Do not shave off all of his hair but rather leave a tuft of hair at his crown.” So, after shaving off nearly all the postulant’s hair, the monk should ask the postulant:
“Shall I cut this tuft?” {{page:{number:99,id:UT22084-001-001-29139,folio:F.50.b}}}
If he answers “No, do not cut it,” then tell him to go. 
But if he answers “Yes, I am happy for you to do so,” then cut it.
{{milestone:{label:1.453,id:UT22084-001-001-842}}}The postulant is then made to bathe. If the weather is cold, he may bathe with warm water. If the weather is warm, he should bathe with cold water. 
{{milestone:{label:1.454,id:UT22084-001-001-2932}}}The preceptor should then give him a begging bowl and saffron robes, which he accepts after bowing at the preceptor’s feet. The preceptor should then dress the postulant, checking to ensure he is not a person without genitalia, a person with two sets of genitalia, or a person with a fistula.{{note:{index122,id:UT22084-001-001-845}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.455,id:UT22084-001-001-846}}}The Blessed One decreed that postulants should be examined, but the embarrassment that the monks’ examination caused to the naked and exposed postulants prompted the Blessed One to decree, “Do not examine him while naked. Examine him without his knowing, while he is putting on the under robe.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.456,id:UT22084-001-001-133442}}}That is how the first part of the ceremony should be performed.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-2-3}}}Allowing the postulant’s going forth
{{milestone:{label:1.457,id:UT22084-001-001-849}}}Then the postulant should be inducted as a renunciant by first going for refuge. This is how he should be inducted.
The postulant is first made to prostrate to the Teacher. Then he is made to prostrate to the preceptor and kneel before him. Having pressed his palms together, he should say:
{{milestone:{label:1.458,id:UT22084-001-001-851}}}“Preceptor, heed me. I, [postulant’s name], will henceforth, for as long as I live, seek refuge in the Buddha, supreme among men; I will seek refuge in the Dharma, supreme among all that is free from attachment; I will seek refuge in the Saṅgha, supreme among communities. Following the example of going forth set by the Blessed One, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly complete Buddha Śākyamuni, the lion of the Śākyas, the king of the Śākyas, I, in going forth, renounce the tokens of the householder life and embrace the tokens of the renunciant life.”
{{milestone:{label:1.459,id:UT22084-001-001-852}}}He repeats this a second and a third time. The preceptor then says:
“This is the method.” {{page:{number:100,id:UT22084-001-001-29140,folio:F.51.a}}}
At which point the renunciant says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.460,id:UT22084-001-001-133480}}}That is the induction as a renunciant.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-3}}}Becoming a novice
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-3-1}}}Inducting the postulant into the novitiate
{{milestone:{label:1.461,id:UT22084-001-001-858}}}The postulant is then directed to the monk who will induct him into the novitiate. He again asks the preceptor whether the postulant is without impediments, and if, upon asking, he is, he should be inducted into the novitiate by going for refuge and promising to live as a novice.
{{milestone:{label:1.462,id:UT22084-001-001-2933}}}The postulant should be inducted into the novitiate in the following way. The postulant is first made to prostrate to the Teacher. Then he is made to prostrate to and kneel before the instructor. Then, with his palms pressed together, he should say :
{{milestone:{label:1.463,id:UT22084-001-001-860}}}“Reverend, heed me. I, [postulant’s name], will henceforth, for as long as I live, seek refuge in the Buddha, supreme among men; I will seek refuge in the Dharma, supreme among pure doctrines; I will seek refuge in the Saṅgha, supreme among communities. I ask that you, reverend, accept me as a novice for as long as I live.”
The postulant repeats this a second and a third time, but the third time he says “instructor” in place of “reverend.” The instructor then says:
{{milestone:{label:1.464,id:UT22084-001-001-862}}}“This is the method.”
At which point the novice says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.465,id:UT22084-001-001-133469}}}That is the giving of the novice vow.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-3-2}}}Marking the time
{{milestone:{label:1.466,id:UT22084-001-001-866}}}Then, any monk other than the instructor should consult the sundial and announce the gnomon, the root, the time of day or night, and the season.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-3-3}}}The novice investiture
{{milestone:{label:1.467,id:UT22084-001-001-868}}}The novice should then promises to keep the precepts by reciting them. This should be done in the following way: 
“Instructor, heed me. Just as noble arhats renounced and swore off killing for as long as they lived, so do I, [novice’s name], henceforth, for as long as I live, renounce and swear to refrain from killing. {{page:{number:101,id:UT22084-001-001-29141,folio:F.51.b}}} With this first branch, I pledge to train in, practice, and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats. Furthermore, noble arhats renounced stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, intoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its by-products which leave one uninhibited, singing, dancing, music, garlands, perfumes, jewelry, cosmetics, tall seating, grand seating, untimely eating, and accepting gold and silver, and thus ceased accepting gold and silver. Just so, henceforth, for as long as I live, so too do I, [novice’s name], renounce stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, intoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its by-products which leave one uninhibited, singing, dancing, music, garlands, perfumes, jewelry, cosmetics, tall seating, grand seating, untimely eating, and accepting gold and silver; thus will I cease to accept gold and silver. With these ten branches, I too pledge to train in, practice, and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats.”
{{milestone:{label:1.468,id:UT22084-001-001-870}}}The instructor then says:
“This is the method.”
{{milestone:{label:1.469,id:UT22084-001-001-133449}}}At which point the novice says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.470,id:UT22084-001-001-133443}}}That marks the end of the rite of induction into the novitiate.

{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-4-1}}}The opening occasion
{{milestone:{label:1.471,id:UT22084-001-001-877}}}Then, if the novice has reached the age of twenty, the preceptor should give him his begging bowl and robes and request the presence of a monk officiant. The preceptor should also request the presence of the monk who will serve as privy advisor, and that of any other monk who will enter the ceremony site. 
{{milestone:{label:1.472,id:UT22084-001-001-878}}}When the monks have gathered there, they should each examine whether they have incurred any offenses in the past half a month that should be refrained from, confessed, {{page:{number:102,id:UT22084-001-001-29142,folio:F.52.a}}} and formally excused.{{note:{index123,id:UT22084-001-001-879}}} Those who recognize such offenses should make reparations by reining them in, confessing them, or having them formally excused before taking their places.
{{milestone:{label:1.473,id:UT22084-001-001-880}}}All of the saṅgha then take their places in concord or in an inner circle.{{note:{index124,id:UT22084-001-001-881}}} In the Middle Country, a quorum of ten monks is needed. In outlying areas, if there are no other monks, then a Vinaya master and a quorum of five will suffice. The ordinand should first prostrate to the Teacher, then prostate three times to each monk. Either of the two types of prostration—bowing prostrate with all four limbs and head, or a kneeling bow—is permissible. 
{{milestone:{label:1.474,id:UT22084-001-001-133444}}}This is how the opening occasion is conducted.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-4-2}}}Requesting the preceptor
{{milestone:{label:1.475,id:UT22084-001-001-884}}}Then, a request should be made to the preceptor. The request is made in the following way. The ordinand should be made to prostrate to the preceptor and then squat before him, with his two heels pressed to a grass mat on bricks so as to relieve pressure on the nerves. Pressing his palms together, he should say, employing whichever address is appropriate—“Preceptor” if addressing the preceptor, “Instructor” if addressing the instructor, or “Reverend” if addressing a monk: 
{{milestone:{label:1.476,id:UT22084-001-001-885}}}“Reverend, heed me. I, [ordinand’s name], ask you, reverend, to serve as preceptor. Reverend, please act as my preceptor. Reverend, please grant me ordination.”
This is repeated a second and a third time, but the third time he says “preceptor” in place of “instructor” or “reverend.” The preceptor then says:
“This is the method.”
{{milestone:{label:1.477,id:UT22084-001-001-133450}}}At which point the ordinand says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.478,id:UT22084-001-001-133470}}}That is the request to the preceptor.
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-001-section-1-3-3-4-3}}}Taking possession of robes that have already been cut and sewn
{{milestone:{label:1.479,id:UT22084-001-001-891}}}The preceptor himself should then take possession of the three robes for the ordinand. It is best if the ordinand has a set of robes already cut and sewn, in which case they are sanctioned as follows. Each of the three robes are folded and laid over the ordinand’s left shoulder, after which both preceptor and ordinand rise. {{page:{number:103,id:UT22084-001-001-29143,folio:F.52.b}}} They both take the robe called the “mantle” in their hands, and the novice says:
“Preceptor, heed me. This is my, [ordinand’s name]’s, robe, woven, good, right, and fit to wear. I take possession of this robe as a mantle.”
{{milestone:{label:1.480,id:UT22084-001-001-893}}}The ordinand repeats this a second and a third time. The preceptor should then say:
“This is the method.”
{{milestone:{label:1.481,id:UT22084-001-001-133451}}}At which point the ordinand says:
“It is excellent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.482,id:UT22084-001-001-897}}}After that, he takes the upper robe in his hands and says:

{{milestone:{label:1.513,id:UT22084-001-001-2937}}}This is how that is done. While seated, he should say the following:
“Reverend saṅgha, please listen. This monk, [privy advisor’s name], is willing to serve as privy advisor to the ordinand [ordinand’s name], at the behest of the preceptor [preceptor’s name].

{{milestone:{label:1.571,id:UT22084-001-001-133432}}}That is the privy advice. Then the monk serving as privy advisor should stand at the head of the eldest monk’s row and say the following with a bow:

“If he is without impediment, he should come.”
{{milestone:{label:1.574,id:UT22084-001-001-133435}}}If that is said, then all is well. A breach occurs if it is not. That is the request to come. The ordinand is then brought into the inner circle and prostrates before the seniormost of those gathered. The monk officiant should then prompt him to ask for ordination. The ordinand first prostrates to the Teacher, then before the seniormost monk. He then squats with his two heels resting on a brick so as to relieve pressure on the nerves.
{{milestone:{label:1.575,id:UT22084-001-001-133436}}}Joining his palms, he says:
“Venerable saṅgha, please listen. The preceptor, [preceptor’s name], speaking on my, [ordinand’s name], behalf, seeks consent from the saṅgha for ordination. If the saṅgha allows the petition of the preceptor [preceptor’s name], who speaks on my, [ordinand’s name], behalf, I ask that the venerable saṅgha grant me ordination. I ask that the venerable saṅgha guide me. I ask that the venerable saṅgha accept charge of me. I ask that the venerable saṅgha show me the way. I ask that the venerable and compassionate saṅgha, in their compassion, extend their compassion to me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.576,id:UT22084-001-001-133437}}}That is repeated a second and a third time. The monk officiant makes an act of motion alone so that the ordinand can be asked before the saṅgha about impediments.
{{milestone:{label:1.577,id:UT22084-001-001-133438}}}While seated, the monk officiant says:
“Venerable saṅgha, please listen. The ordinand [ordinand’s name] seeks consent from the saṅgha to receive ordination from the preceptor [preceptor’s name]. If he has petitioned the saṅgha to give consent to the preceptor [preceptor’s name] to grant ordination to the ordinand, and if the time is right and the saṅgha can allow it, I ask that the saṅgha grant its consent.

{{milestone:{label:1.578,id:UT22084-001-001-133439}}}That is the request. The monk officiant then inquires into impediments before the saṅgha.

“Venerable saṅgha, please listen. The ordinand [ordinand’s name] has sought consent from the saṅgha to receive ordination from the preceptor [preceptor’s name]. He has asked the saṅgha to give consent for the preceptor [preceptor’s name] to grant ordination to the ordinand [ordinand’s name].

I ask that any who cannot accept it speak up.”
{{milestone:{label:1.582,id:UT22084-001-001-2962}}}This is the first motion to act. This is repeated a second and a third time. The saṅgha acknowledges its acceptance and gives its consent to the preceptor to grant ordination to the ordinand by remaining silent.

Measure it like this, using splints of wood.” When the monks measured the length of a shadow using long splints, it also proved too difficult, prompting the Blessed One to order, “Measure with a splint just four finger widths tall. A splint of exactly that length shall be called a ‘gnomon.’ ”

“Listen, venerable [newly ordained monk’s name]. The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened, omniscient, all-seeing Buddha, has declared four things that lead to an offense for monks who have gone forth and been ordained. If a monk were to engage in them, he would immediately disqualify himself as a monk, disqualify himself as an ascetic, disqualify himself as an heir of the Śākya, and would fall from monkhood. It would leave his spiritual practice in tatters, leave him ruined, wrecked, fallen, and defeated. There would be no way to restore his spiritual practice. {{page:{number:117,id:UT22084-001-001-29157,folio:F.59.b}}} It is like a palmyra tree: if you were to lop off its crown, it would no longer be green, nor would it flourish, grow, or expand. What are the four? They are desires, clinging to desires, longing for desires, and pursuing desires, which the Blessed One criticized in many ways. It was abandoning desires that he honored; it was renouncing them, rejecting them, forsaking them; it was freedom from desires, their cessation, their pacification, and their vanishing that he esteemed, reverenced, honored, and venerated.

It is like a palmyra tree: If you were to lop off its crown, it would no longer be green, nor would it flourish, grow, or expand. From this day forward, you must endeavor to fully safeguard your intentions by being mindful of and attentive to forsaking improper arrangements, improper actions, and improper behavior. {{page:{number:118,id:UT22084-001-001-29158,folio:F.60.a}}} Do you accept not to engage in such things?”

You are a thief! A fool! An idiot! A robber!’ and execute, bind, or exile him. If a monk thus takes what has not been given, that monk also incurs a defeat and so should not remain. If a monk were to do such things, he would immediately disqualify himself as a monk, disqualify himself as an ascetic, disqualify himself as an heir of the Śākya, and would fall from monkhood.

Venerable, since, from now on, you should not so much as kill an ant intentionally, what need is there to mention a human or a human embryo? Venerable, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened, omniscient, all-seeing Buddha declared that if any monk intentionally kills a human, or a human embryo, with his own hands, or gives them a weapon, sends an assassin to them, pressures them, or extols the merits of death to them, then say this to him: ‘Oh! Why do you visit such negativity, filth, and evil on the living? Oh! You, who are alive and well, you suggest it would be better to die. In your mind, do you desire and scheme, while pressuring them with the many things you say?’ The Blessed One declared that if, initiated by that monk’s extolling the merits of death, the time comes that it happens, then that monk incurs a defeat and thus should not remain. If a monk were to do such things as these, he would immediately disqualify himself as a monk, disqualify himself as an ascetic, disqualify himself as an heir of the Śākya, and would fall from monkhood. It would leave his spiritual practice in tatters, leave him ruined, wrecked, fallen, and defeated. There would be no way to restore his spiritual practice.

{{milestone:{label:1.664,id:UT22084-001-001-2972}}}The Blessed Buddha pledged to pass the rainy season in the Kalandakanivāpa at the Bamboo Park near Rājagṛha, at which point a small number of elder monks and a large number of new ones {{page:{number:139,id:UT22084-001-001-29179,folio:F.70.b}}} promised to pass the rainy season at Rājagṛha. After the three months of monsoon had passed, the Blessed One instructed the venerable Ānanda, “Go to the monks, Ānanda, and tell them, ‘The Tāthagata will travel the realm. As your task will be to accompany the Tāthagata on his travels through the realm, happily ready your robes.’ ” 
{{milestone:{label:1.665,id:UT22084-001-001-1225}}}Heeding the Blessed One’s instruction, Ānanda replied, “I shall do as the Reverend instructs.”
To the monks, he said, “Venerables, the Tāthagata will travel the realm. Your task is to accompany him on his travels, so you should happily ready your robes.”
{{milestone:{label:1.666,id:UT22084-001-001-2973}}}“Venerable Ānanda,” replied the elder monks, “we cannot travel the realm with the Blessed One, for we are old.”
{{milestone:{label:1.667,id:UT22084-001-001-1228}}}And the new monks said, “Venerable Ānanda, we too cannot travel the realm with the Blessed One, for we are new and our preceptors and instructors will not go. If our preceptors and instructors do not go we must return swiftly and thus, those who have sought refuge{{note:{index152,id:UT22084-001-001-1229}}} will have to seek another yet again.”
{{milestone:{label:1.668,id:UT22084-001-001-2974}}}After the three months of monsoon had passed, the Blessed One donned his robe. He then set out to travel the realm with a small entourage, who carried with them their begging bowls and robes. 
{{milestone:{label:1.669,id:UT22084-001-001-1231}}}For blessed buddhas on a journey, it is natural to wonder about the behavior of those who accompany them. Were they properly trained? Were they properly clothed? Did they carry their belongings or did they lack uniformity? {{page:{number:140,id:UT22084-001-001-29180,folio:F.71.a}}} While wondering thus, blessed buddhas look upon them by turning to the right as an elephant would. Thus, on his journey, the Blessed Buddha looked about by turning to the right as an elephant would. When the Blessed Buddha had done so, he saw the Tāthagata’s entourage to be small. 
{{milestone:{label:1.670,id:UT22084-001-001-1232}}} Though they see, blessed buddhas may inquire about what they already know. Though they already know, they may inquire—or, even though they know, they may not inquire. They inquire when the time is right, not when the time has passed. Their inquiries are meaningful, not meaningless. In this way blessed buddhas dam the flow of meaningless inquiries. 
As blessed buddhas know the time for a meaningful inquiry, the Blessed Buddha asked Ānanda, “What is the cause due to which the Tāthagata’s companions are now so few? What are the circumstances for it?”
{{milestone:{label:1.671,id:UT22084-001-001-1234}}}“Reverend, a small number of elder monks and a large number of new monks discussed the matter during the rains retreat in Rājagṛha. The elder monks said, ‘Venerable Ānanda, we cannot travel the realm with the Blessed One, for we are old.’ And the new monks said, ‘Venerable Ānanda, we too cannot travel the realm with the Blessed One, for we are new and our preceptors and instructors will not go. If our preceptors and instructors do not go, we must return swiftly and thus, those who have sought a refuge will have to seek another yet again.’ Reverend, that is the cause due to which the Tāthagata’s companions are now so few; {{page:{number:141,id:UT22084-001-001-29181,folio:F.71.b}}} those are the circumstances for it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.672,id:UT22084-001-001-1235}}}“Ānanda, I therefore further permit that those with five years and five qualities should travel the realm without a refuge.{{note:{index153,id:UT22084-001-001-1236}}} What are those five qualities? That the monk knows what constitutes an offense, knows what does not constitute an offense, knows what is light, knows what is weighty, and knows how to recite the Prātimokṣasūtra and its supplements. Those with five years and five qualities should travel the realm independently. Do not resent this.”
{{milestone:{label:1.673,id:UT22084-001-001-2975}}}The venerable Upāli asked the Blessed Buddha, “Reverend, the Blessed One has said, ‘Those with five years and five qualities should travel the realm independently.’ What about a revered monk of six years?

{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-001-001-1257}}}{{page:{number:142,id:UT22084-001-001-29182,folio:F.72.a}}} The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī, when an elder who was immature, dense, dim-witted, and unskilled allowed a follower of another tīrthika tradition to go forth. The elder granted the tīrthika ordination, sparking a number of disputes between monks. After the tīrthika had offered back his training and returned to his community of tīrthikas, the monks asked the Blessed One about it. This is how he responded: “Monks, look at how that benighted man has turned his back on such a fine and well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya and returned to his community of tīrthikas. Monks, it seems to me he is behaving like a dog, wracked by hunger, but refusing fine food and fare and eating excrement instead. Monks, this is how a benighted man acts who turns his back on such a fine and well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya and returns to his former community of tīrthikas.”
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-001-001-1258}}}Then the Blessed One declared, “Monks, apart from our Śākya kin and dreadlocked fire-worshippers,{{note:{index157,id:UT22084-001-001-1259}}} the going forth of tīrthikas who do not have a sense of reverence should not be allowed nor should they be ordained. If perchance a Śākya kin should come under a tīrthika banner, and if perchance he should want monkhood, to go forth and be ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, then, monks, his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained. Why is that? Because, monks, I give kin exceptions to kin. If perchance a wandering mendicant from another tīrthika order should come, and he should want monkhood, to go forth and be ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, then, monks, understand that he should be allowed to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months. {{page:{number:143,id:UT22084-001-001-29183,folio:F.72.b}}} Monks, if, after having submitted to his station, the follower of another tīrthika order has a sense of reverence, his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.4,id:UT22084-001-001-1260}}}When the Blessed One said that followers of other tīrthika orders should be allowed to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months, the monks were in a quandary, not knowing how such robes should be given. “Monks,” instructed the Blessed One, “if a follower of another tīrthika order wishing to go forth approaches any one of you, you should ascertain through questioning him whether he has any impediments. Once you have ascertained this, have him take the threefold refuge and, after he commits himself to living as a lay devotee, give him the lay devotee vows. Then, as the entire saṅgha sits in concord, have him prostrate to them in order of seniority before sitting in a squatting position. Pressing his palms together, he should say, ‘Reverend saṅgha, please heed me. I, the tīrthika [tīrthika’s name], wish to renounce this identity and go forth. I, the tīrthika [tīrthika’s name], petition the saṅgha to allow me to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months. I, the tīrthika [tīrthika’s name], ask that the reverend and compassionate saṅgha, out of your compassion, might allow me to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months.’
{{milestone:{label:2.5,id:UT22084-001-001-1261}}}“This should be repeated a second and a third time, after which a monk moves the motion be acted upon. This is how the request is made: while seated, the monk says, ‘Reverend saṅgha, please heed me. This tīrthika [tīrthika’s name] wishes to renounce this identity and go forth. This tīrthika has asked the saṅgha to allow him to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months. If the reverend saṅgha can accept it, I ask the saṅgha to give its consent and {{page:{number:144,id:UT22084-001-001-29184,folio:F.73.a}}} allow this tīrthika to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months.’

Therefore, I ask the saṅgha that you allow him to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months. If the saṅgha were to permit this action, I would ask the venerables who can accept it to please remain silent. Those who cannot accept it, please speak up.’
{{milestone:{label:2.7,id:UT22084-001-001-1263}}}“That is the first motion to act. This should be repeated a second and a third time. The saṅgha, by remaining silent, acknowledges its acceptance and gives its consent for the tīrthika [tīrthika’s name] to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months.
{{milestone:{label:2.8,id:UT22084-001-001-1264}}}“For any tīrthika to whom the saṅgha gives its permission to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months, his food is the saṅgha’s responsibility. His robes are the preceptor’s responsibility. His duties are akin to those in the novice ranks.”
{{milestone:{label:2.9,id:UT22084-001-001-1265}}}Upāli asked the Blessed Buddha, “Reverend, the Blessed One has said, ‘If, after having submitted to his station, the follower of another tīrthika order has a sense of reverence, his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained.’ If so, then reverend, by what measure may we say that a follower of another tīrthika order has a sense of reverence?”

{{milestone:{label:2.12,id:UT22084-001-001-1268}}}“Monks, the going forth of dreadlocked fire-worshippers should be allowed and they should be ordained. Why?

Come twilight, reduced and wracked by hunger as they were, they would cry out and the Blessed One would hear these great many cries from within the monastery’s grounds. {{page:{number:146,id:UT22084-001-001-29186,folio:F.74.a}}}

{{milestone:{label:2.15,id:UT22084-001-001-1271}}}As blessed buddhas know the time for a meaningful inquiry, the Blessed Buddha asked the venerable Ānanda, “Who are these great many young boys who cry within the monastery’s grounds at twilight?”

{{milestone:{label:2.22,id:UT22084-001-001-1279}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī, when a householder living in Śrāvastī took a wife of equal caste and together they played with, took pleasure in, and amused one other. The wife with whom he had played, taken pleasure, and amused himself gave birth to a son who was nurtured and grew until he was big. 
{{milestone:{label:2.23,id:UT22084-001-001-1280}}} At a certain point, the householder’s kin had dwindled, his riches had dwindled, and his possessions had dwindled, prompting the thought, “As I am grown old and cannot gain more riches, I shall go forth.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.24,id:UT22084-001-001-1281}}}He then said this to his son, who replied, “Father, if you are to go forth, then I too shall go forth.”

The whole of Śrāvastī is your field and fatherland, so seek out alms and live on them.”
{{milestone:{label:2.28,id:UT22084-001-001-1289}}} Early the next morning, the father put on his under robe, picked up his begging bowl and robes, and went to beg alms in Śrāvastī with his novice son.

{{milestone:{label:3.2,id:UT22084-001-001-1308}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī, when two of Upananda’s novices, Kaṇṭaka and Mahaka, flirted with, groped, and tickled one another. They acted as a man does with a woman, or as a woman does with a man. Once, when they were behaving like this, the monks asked the Blessed One about it, and the Blessed One thought, “All those shortcomings ensue from monks placing two novices together.”
{{milestone:{label:3.3,id:UT22084-001-001-1309}}}He then decreed, “In light of this, monks should not place two novices together. If you do so, a breach occurs.”
{{milestone:{label:3.4,id:UT22084-001-001-1310}}} After the Blessed One had so decreed, sure enough, two brothers turned up, saying, “We two shall go forth together, at the same time.” When that occurred, the monks did not allow their going forth so the two of them left without going forth. 
{{milestone:{label:3.5,id:UT22084-001-001-1311}}}When that proved to be an impediment to monkhood—the state of having gone forth and been ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya—the monks asked the Blessed One about it, and the Blessed One decreed, “If two brothers turn up as they are sure to, saying, ‘We two shall go forth together, at the same time,’ their going forth should be allowed. Once they have gone forth, they should be ordained if they have reached twenty years. If one should have reached twenty years, then he {{page:{number:150,id:UT22084-001-001-29190,folio:F.76.a}}} should be ordained while the other should be left a novice.

{{milestone:{label:3.6,id:UT22084-001-001-1312}}} The one he is entrusted to shall ordain him, for the Blessed One decreed, “Whoever that may be, it is he that should grant ordination.” If ordination was not given, the Blessed One decreed, “Induce him to grant what was not given.”

{{milestone:{label:3.7,id:UT22084-001-001-1313}}}While the Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī, there was a householder living in Śrāvastī with a clever servant who was industrious, assured in his work, and the first to any task, no matter how small. At a certain point the householder insulted his servant, prompting the servant to think, “This householder is hard to please and I cannot guard my mind against his abuse. I ought to run away. But leaving one’s own land behind is hard, so instead I shall go forth among the ascetic sons of the Śākya, for they have secured from the king the liberty of a prince.”
{{milestone:{label:3.8,id:UT22084-001-001-1315}}}With that he went to Jetavana, where he approached a monk and said, “Noble one, I want to go forth.”
{{milestone:{label:3.9,id:UT22084-001-001-1316}}}After allowing his going forth and ordaining him, the monk gave him instructions. To these, the former servant applied himself with diligence, energy, and exertion so that he abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship, becoming an arhat free of attachment to the three realms, for whom filth was equal to gold, for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand,{{note:{index158,id:UT22084-001-001-1317}}} whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood,{{note:{index159,id:UT22084-001-001-1318}}} and whose knowledge had rent open the shell. He attained knowledge, clairvoyance, and discerning wisdom. He turned his back on worldly gain, desires, {{page:{number:151,id:UT22084-001-001-29191,folio:F.76.b}}} and esteem, and was venerated, honored, and saluted by Indra and the gods who attend him. 
{{milestone:{label:3.10,id:UT22084-001-001-1319}}}The householder, meanwhile, was feeling regret: “If my servant was first to all of my tasks, no matter how small, why did I insult him? If I see him now, I will beg his forgiveness.” With that he sat down at the gates to Śrāvastī. 
{{milestone:{label:3.11,id:UT22084-001-001-1320}}}The next morning, the monk put on his under robe, picked up his begging bowl and robes, and was preparing to beg alms in Śrāvastī when the householder saw him and said, “Sir, if you have gone forth, who will attend me? Come back!” As the householder reached out to grab at him, the monk, like a kingly swan taken to wing, flew up into the sky above, blazing and brilliant, as a miraculous show of rain and thunder began.

{{milestone:{label:3.41,id:UT22084-001-001-1354}}} After the son was ordained, they measured the shadows and noted the time of day and the hour. They made sure he knew the foundations, what things brought about offenses, what constituted spiritual practice, how to attain perfect fulfillment of his greatest desire, and how to practice the equally applicable ethical code. They enjoined him to bond with his role model in the renunciant life, to dwell in tranquility, to carry out his obligations, to do what he must do to fully understand his unspoken commitments, to heed what he reveres, and told him:

“Son of a lord, do as you wish.”
{{milestone:{label:3.49,id:UT22084-001-001-1365}}}With that, he set out for another land to trade, {{page:{number:159,id:UT22084-001-001-29199,folio:F.80.b}}} and in this land he suffered misfortune. His wife gave guardianship of their son to relatives while supporting and providing for him through her own industry. Once he had grown, she placed him under the tutelage of a court scribe. While other boys of the lad’s age had already learned their letters and had begun to study the grammar treatises, he was still struggling to learn his letters. His mother went to the court scribe and said, “Lord, whatever the other boys of the lad’s age may offer you, I too will give you. Those boys have already learned their letters and have begun to study the grammar treatises, while this lad is still learning his letters.”
{{milestone:{label:3.50,id:UT22084-001-001-1366}}}The court scribe replied, “There are two factors in honing one’s intelligence. The first is a sense of modesty, which pertains to oneself; another is a sense of propriety, which pertains to others. This lad has no modesty nor does he have any sense of propriety. For this, you too are at fault, for you object when I strike him.”
“I am guilty of that, as you say,” she responded, “and I do object to your striking him.”
{{milestone:{label:3.51,id:UT22084-001-001-1368}}}Another time, the court scribe struck him and the lad went off crying to his mother. His mother asked him, “Son, why are you crying?”
“Mother, the court scribe struck me.”
His mother then struck him too, prompting the lad to think, “Both are at fault. Before I was only struck in one place. Now I am struck in both. I cannot bear being hurt in both places so I will run away.”
{{milestone:{label:3.52,id:UT22084-001-001-1371}}}With that, he set out for Jetavana, where he saw a novice picking flowers and said, “Noble one, you look so happy. Why?”
“It is because I have gone forth. Why don’t you go forth?” 
“Noble one, who can allow my going forth?”
The novice said, “Come, {{page:{number:160,id:UT22084-001-001-29200,folio:F.81.a}}} let us go before a preceptor,” and led him away. When they arrived before a preceptor, the novice said, “Preceptor, this son of noble family wants to go forth. I ask that you allow his going forth.” And with that, the preceptor allowed his going forth. 
{{milestone:{label:3.53,id:UT22084-001-001-1375}}}His mother went to the court scribe, who asked, “Where is the lad? Today I struck him.”

“He has run away,” the court scribe said. “You should go and look for him.”
{{milestone:{label:3.54,id:UT22084-001-001-1378}}}She went searching for the boy, asking for word from the ascetics in the forest, among the tīrthika communities, and in other places; but wherever she asked, no one had heard any word of him. She went to Śrāvastī and waited at the gate. In the morning, the novice put on his under robe, picked up his begging bowl and robes, and was preparing to beg alms in Śrāvastī with the ascetic follower novice in tow. When she saw her son, she beat her fists on his chest and cried, “Son! I went searching for you among the ascetics in the forest, among the tīrthika communities, and in other places but everywhere I looked, no one had heard any word of you. Why have you gone forth among these thieving sons of the Śākya? Come back!” 
{{milestone:{label:3.55,id:UT22084-001-001-1379}}}Grabbing him with both hands, she dragged him home. When that proved to be an impediment to monkhood, the state of having gone forth and been ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, the monks appealed to the Blessed One.

“Mother, as I am of the highest caste, how could I go forth into the mixed caste order of the ascetic sons of the Śākya?”
“Son, has your brain turned to hay? Or are you just babbling?”

{{milestone:{label:3.62,id:UT22084-001-001-1391}}}As soon as the monk allowed his going forth, he sat down, moaning. The monk asked him, “Why do you sit and moan?”
“Preceptor, I am unwell.”
“Sir, why have you fallen ill upon going forth?” he asked.
“Preceptor, I have not fallen ill upon going forth. I was already unwell {{page:{number:162,id:UT22084-001-001-29202,folio:F.82.a}}} when I went forth.”

“Preceptor,” he replied, “what would you have said to me?”
The preceptor was seated, unhappy, when his monk appretinces and monk journeymen happened by and asked, “Preceptor, why do you sit here thus, so unhappy?”
“Boys, I have allowed the going forth of an ill son of noble family, so I will have to place him in the infirmary.”
{{milestone:{label:3.64,id:UT22084-001-001-1399}}}“Preceptor,” they replied, “the Blessed One has said there are two types of saints, those who do not assume burdens they do not bear and those who carry through to the end those burdens they bear. You must carry through to the end this burden you bear.”

“It is a grave illness,” he replied. “Have the king provide all that is required and I shall try to cure him. But he will only recover quickly if you noble ones nurse him.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.66,id:UT22084-001-001-1402}}}The physician then treated the ill person and he was cured.

“No, preceptor, I have not.”

“I will return home, preceptor.”

“You cured me when I was unwell.”
{{milestone:{label:3.71,id:UT22084-001-001-1416}}}“I don’t recall that,” replied the physician.

As he sat off to one side, the physician requested the Blessed One, “Reverend, the noble monks’ allowing the going forth of ill sons of noble families and their ordination will, at some point, cause even the king’s treasury and stores to dwindle, diminish, and come to an end. It will cause even my body to flag, and the virtuous endeavors of noble beings to wane. O Blessed One! It would be good if you, in your compassion, would give some consideration to prohibiting the noble ones from allowing the going forth of ill sons of noble families and ordaining them.” {{page:{number:164,id:UT22084-001-001-29204,folio:F.83.a}}}

Their relatives came to see the newly ordained, who taught the Dharma to their assembled family members, and they in turn, upon hearing the Dharma, sought to go forth on the spot. Among those who, upon hearing the Dharma, were allowed to go forth on the spot were the fathers of some Śākya women, their brothers-in-law, their husbands, brothers, and sons. Overwhelmed by grief, the Śākya women cried out in misery in the twilight. 
{{milestone:{label:3.77,id:UT22084-001-001-1423}}}In the twilight, King Śuddhodana heard the sound of a great many Śākya women crying out in misery. Hearing their cries, he asked the Śākyas, “Gentlemen, why do so many Śākya women cry out in misery in the twilight?”
{{milestone:{label:3.78,id:UT22084-001-001-1424}}}“Your Majesty,” they replied, “the going forth of certain noble ones and sons of noble families has been allowed, and they have been ordained without the consent of their parents. The going forth of the fathers, brothers-in-law, husbands, brothers, and sons of some Śākya women has also been allowed. Thus, overwhelmed by grief, {{page:{number:165,id:UT22084-001-001-29205,folio:F.83.b}}} the Śākya women cry out in misery in the twilight.”
{{milestone:{label:3.79,id:UT22084-001-001-1425}}}“This is my responsibility and my responsibility alone,” thought King Śuddhodana, “so I must go to see the Blessed One.” King Śuddhodana went to see the Blessed One and on arriving, bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet before taking a seat off to one side. The king then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I have a worthy suit. Tathāgata, I have a worthy suit.”
{{milestone:{label:3.80,id:UT22084-001-001-1426}}}“Great king, if you insist on passing up the boons of the tathāgatas, arhats, and perfectly complete buddhas, tell me, what favor could I grant you?”
“One that noble beings would find easy.”
“If I find it easy, I shall grant it.”
{{milestone:{label:3.81,id:UT22084-001-001-1429}}}“Reverend, when the Blessed One was born, the Blessed One was destined to become king of the world. I even thought I would soar through the sky and see the four continents, my delight and pleasure being not inconsiderable. 
{{milestone:{label:3.82,id:UT22084-001-001-1430}}}“Reverend, when the Blessed One became a renunciant, what hopes I had for you to become king of the world were dashed. So instead, I went on to think that the prince Sundarananda would conquer and become king of the world. When those hopes were shown to be just that, and the prince Sundarananda became a renunciant, the hopes I had for conquering and for becoming king of the world were dashed too. So instead, I then went on to think that the prince Rāhulabhadra would become a king of real command. When those hopes were shown to be just that, and the prince Rāhulabhadra became a renunciant, what hopes I had for becoming a king of real command were completely and utterly dashed too.
{{milestone:{label:3.83,id:UT22084-001-001-1431}}}“Reverend, if only it were otherwise and your parents could have found satisfaction in you! Reverend, {{page:{number:166,id:UT22084-001-001-29206,folio:F.84.a}}} these noble monks are allowing the going forth of sons of noble families and ordaining them without their parents’ consent. O Blessed One! It would be good if, in your compassion, you were to give some consideration to prohibiting the noble ones from allowing the going forth of sons of noble families and their ordination without their parents’ consent.”
{{milestone:{label:3.84,id:UT22084-001-001-1432}}}By keeping silent, the Blessed One assented to King Śuddhodana. Understanding the Blessed One’s silence to be assent, King Śuddhodana bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet and took his leave. 
{{milestone:{label:3.85,id:UT22084-001-001-1433}}}The Blessed One thought, “All those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing the going forth of sons of noble families and their ordination without their parents’ consent.” He then decreed, “In light of this, monks should not allow the going forth of sons of noble families or ordain them without their parents’ consent. If someone approaches any of you wishing to go forth, ask him, ‘Have your parents given their consent?’ If you allow going forth without asking this, a breach occurs.”
{{milestone:{label:3.86,id:UT22084-001-001-1434}}}After the Blessed One had decreed, “A monk should not allow the going forth of sons of noble families or ordain them without their parents’ consent,” the monks did not allow others to go forth who came, without their parents’ consent, from faraway lands where their parents could not be consulted. Thus, their going forth not allowed, the hopefuls turned back.
{{milestone:{label:3.87,id:UT22084-001-001-1435}}}When that proved to be an impediment to monkhood, the state of having gone forth and been ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, the monks asked the Blessed One about it, and he decreed, “Those who come without their parents’ consent from faraway lands where their parents cannot be consulted should be allowed to go forth. {{page:{number:167,id:UT22084-001-001-29207,folio:F.84.b}}} This you need not regret.”

{{milestone:{label:4.2,id:UT22084-001-001-1437}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī, when the ignorant Virūḍhaka had slaughtered the Śākya inhabitants of Kapilavastu, although they had not been aggressive, antagonistic, or thieving. The two sons of the venerable Ānanda’s younger sister were left orphaned, and were wandering aimlessly when traders from Śrāvastī on their way to Kapilavastu on business recognized the two good-looking lads and asked, “Boys, where are your parents?”
“They were killed by the ignorant Virūḍhaka,” they replied.
{{milestone:{label:4.3,id:UT22084-001-001-1440}}}“If your uncle, the famous monk known as reverend Ānanda, is staying in Śrāvastī, why don’t you go there?”
They replied, “Who would take us there?”
“We will take you.”
{{milestone:{label:4.4,id:UT22084-001-001-1443}}}After they traded their goods and made a profit, the traders set out for Śrāvastī with the two boys in tow. They left the boys at the gate of Jetavana, where the venerable Ānanda recognized them and asked, “Boys, where are your parents?”
“They were killed by the ignorant Virūḍhaka.”
{{milestone:{label:4.5,id:UT22084-001-001-1445}}}Because Ānanda cared for his kin, on hearing of their death he became choked with tears. 
The monks asked him, “Venerable Ānanda, who are these two lads?”
“They are my sister’s boys.”
{{milestone:{label:4.6,id:UT22084-001-001-1448}}}“Why don’t you take them in?”
“I barely get enough from begging to fill my own stomach,” he replied. “Where out there can I get enough to provide for them?”
“If these two boys offer the monks herbs, {{page:{number:168,id:UT22084-001-001-29208,folio:F.85.a}}} flowers, and fruits, in return the monks will give them the leftovers from their begging bowls.”
{{milestone:{label:4.7,id:UT22084-001-001-1451}}}After being taken in, the boys began to offer the monks herbs, flowers, and fruits, and in return the monks gave them the leftovers from their begging bowls. After a few days of giving the two their leftovers, they stopped. So Ānanda went out and about begging alms, but received only just enough to fill his own stomach. Eating half himself and giving the other half to the two boys, he became pallid, emaciated, feeble, withered, thin, and weak. 
{{milestone:{label:4.8,id:UT22084-001-001-1452}}}Although they know, blessed buddhas may inquire about what they already know. Though they already know, they may inquire—or, even though they know, they may not inquire. They inquire when the time is right, not when the time has passed. Their inquiries are meaningful, not meaningless. In this way blessed buddhas dam the flow of meaningless inquiries.
{{milestone:{label:4.9,id:UT22084-001-001-1453}}}As blessed buddhas know the time for a meaningful inquiry, the Blessed Buddha asked the monks, “Monks, why has the monk Ānanda become pallid, emaciated, feeble, withered, thin, and weak?”
{{milestone:{label:4.10,id:UT22084-001-001-1454}}}“Blessed One,” they replied, “since the two sons of the venerable Ānanda’s younger sister were orphaned, he has gone out receiving only enough alms to fill his own mouth,{{note:{index161,id:UT22084-001-001-1455}}} half of which he takes for himself while the other half he gives to them. This has reduced the venerable Ānanda to such a state.”
{{milestone:{label:4.11,id:UT22084-001-001-1456}}}The Blessed One then asked the venerable Ānanda, “Will you not allow these two boys’ going forth?” {{page:{number:169,id:UT22084-001-001-29209,folio:F.85.b}}}
 “Blessed One, I will allow their going forth.”
{{milestone:{label:4.12,id:UT22084-001-001-1458}}}The Blessed One decreed, “In light of that, I give permission for food given to the saṅgha to be given to those wishing to go forth.”
{{milestone:{label:4.13,id:UT22084-001-001-1459}}}After the Blessed One gave permission for food that has been given to the saṅgha to be given to those wishing to go forth, the monks gave them food for a few days and then began to complain. The Blessed One then asked Ānanda a second time, “Did you refuse to allow these two boys’ going forth?”
“Reverend, the two of them are not yet fifteen.”
{{milestone:{label:4.14,id:UT22084-001-001-1461}}}“Can the two boys scare crows away from the saṅgha’s sleeping quarters?”
“Reverend, they can throw stones.”
“In that case, Ānanda, I give my permission to allow freely the going forth of those as young as seven years old, provided they can scare away crows.”
 Ānanda then allowed the two to go forth. 
{{milestone:{label:4.15,id:UT22084-001-001-1466}}}After Ānanda’s nephews went forth, Ānanda began to teach them to read, but after a few days of study they began to misbehave. The venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana asked Ānanda, “Why do you not make these two novices study?”
“Elder,” replied Ānanda, “they do not listen to me. I do not know what to do, but I must compel these two novices to study.”
{{milestone:{label:4.16,id:UT22084-001-001-1467}}}Mahāmaudgalyāyana replied, “Elder, do as you say.”
So Ānanda began to make the two novices study. But again, after a few days, the two of them began to misbehave, and Ānanda asked Mahāmaudgalyāyana, “Elder, why can I not make these two novices study?”
“Ānanda, these two will not yet listen to me either.”
“Elder, the two novices must be given a little scare.”
{{milestone:{label:4.17,id:UT22084-001-001-1471}}}The venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana said to the two, “Novices, {{page:{number:170,id:UT22084-001-001-29210,folio:F.86.a}}} let’s do our daily practice.” 
“Yes, noble one.”
“Bring something to sit on.”
{{milestone:{label:4.18,id:UT22084-001-001-1474}}}Mahāmaudgalyāyana then took the two novices for their daily practice. On the way, Mahāmaudgalyāyana conjured up an apparition of beings in the hell realms, who cried out from being cut, sliced, crushed, and hacked to pieces. 
The two boys exclaimed, “Noble one, what is this?”
 “Have a closer look,” he replied.
{{milestone:{label:4.19,id:UT22084-001-001-1477}}}The two of them approached and found what was being done there—the cutting, the slicing, the crushing, and the hacking to pieces. Some were being sliced apart by saws, some were being ground in mills, and some were being melted down in boiling vats. When they saw two boiling iron vats standing there empty, they asked, “Gentlemen, will no one be put into these two?”
{{milestone:{label:4.20,id:UT22084-001-001-1478}}}“No,” they replied. “For the two sons of noble Ānanda’s sister have gone forth and yet lazily pass their time. When their time has come and they die, they will be reborn here, so these two vats have been reserved for them.”
Terrified, they thought, “If we’re recognized, they’ll put us in those vats this very day,” and began to look all about them. They went to Mahāmaudgalyāyana, who asked, “Did you see something?”
“Noble one, we did.”
{{milestone:{label:4.21,id:UT22084-001-001-1481}}}“What?”
“Beings in the hell realms.”
“What were they doing there?”
{{milestone:{label:4.22,id:UT22084-001-001-1484}}}“They were doing all sorts of things—cutting, slicing, crushing, hacking to pieces,” they replied. “There, some were being sliced apart by saws, some were being ground in mills, and some were being melted down in boiling vats. {{page:{number:171,id:UT22084-001-001-29211,folio:F.86.b}}} When we saw two boiling iron vats standing empty, we asked, ‘Gentlemen, will no one be put into these two?’ And they replied, ‘No. For the two sons of noble Ānanda’s sister have gone forth and yet lazily pass their time. When their time has come and they die, they’ll be reborn here, so these two have been reserved for them.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:4.23,id:UT22084-001-001-1485}}}Then Mahāmaudgalyāyana advised, “Thus, novices, knowing that disadvantages such as these, and others too, accrue from laziness, apply yourselves diligently.”
{{milestone:{label:4.24,id:UT22084-001-001-2979}}}The two nephews began to apply themselves to their studies with diligence. If they thought of the beings in the hell realms in the morning, they would not even eat; if they thought of them in the afternoon, they would vomit up what they had eaten. Thus it was that the two of them became pallid, emaciated, feeble, withered, thin, and weak. 
{{milestone:{label:4.25,id:UT22084-001-001-1487}}}Mahāmaudgalyāyana said, “Ānanda, the two have become dispirited.”
“Elder, now they must be inspired.”
Mahāmaudgalyāyana said to the two, “Novices, let’s go for our daily practice.” 
“Noble one,” they replied, “we will go, but we will not return to that one place.”
“Bring something to sit on.”
{{milestone:{label:4.26,id:UT22084-001-001-1492}}}Mahāmaudgalyāyana then took the two novices for their daily practice. On the way, Mahāmaudgalyāyana conjured up an apparition of the gods, along with the sounds of the vīṇā, ektara, balari, mahāti, and the sughoṣak.{{note:{index162,id:UT22084-001-001-1493}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.27,id:UT22084-001-001-1494}}}The two boys exclaimed, “Noble one, what is this?”
“Have a closer look,” he replied.
The two of them approached and followed the sounds of the vīṇā, ektara, balari, mahāti, and the sughoṣak to where there stood two palaces strewn with beds and divans replete with goddesses. Seeing no gods in either palace, they inquired, “Mistresses, {{page:{number:172,id:UT22084-001-001-29212,folio:F.87.a}}} are there no gods in either of these palaces?”
“No, there are none.”
{{milestone:{label:4.28,id:UT22084-001-001-1498}}}“Why is that?”
“The two sons of noble Ānanda’s sister have gone forth, and since they act and apply themselves diligently, when their time has come and they die, they will be reborn here, so these two have been reserved for them.”
{{milestone:{label:4.29,id:UT22084-001-001-1500}}}Overjoyed, they went to Mahāmaudgalyāyana, who again asked, “Did you see something?”
“Noble one, we did.”
“What?”
“Gods.”
{{milestone:{label:4.30,id:UT22084-001-001-1504}}}“What were they doing?”
“We could hear the sounds of the vīṇā, ektara, balari, mahāti, and the sughoṣak, and found two palaces strewn with beds and divans replete with goddesses, who said, ‘The two sons of noble Ānanda’s sister have gone forth, and since they act and apply themselves diligently, when their time has come and they die, they will be reborn here, so these two have been reserved for them.’ ” 
{{milestone:{label:4.31,id:UT22084-001-001-1506}}}Then Mahāmaudgalyāyana advised, “Thus, novices, knowing that advantages such as these, and others too, accrue from diligence, apply yourselves.” 
The two of them began to apply themselves to their studies and receive instructions. After a time, they came across the following passage in the Nidānasaṃyukta:{{note:{index163,id:UT22084-001-001-1508}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.32,id:UT22084-001-001-1509}}} Then, taking dirt from the tip of his fingernail, the Blessed One asked the monks, “Monks, what do you think? Which is more, the dirt I take from the tip of my fingernail or the dirt that is upon this earth?” {{page:{number:173,id:UT22084-001-001-29213,folio:F.87.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.33,id:UT22084-001-001-1510}}}“Reverend, the dirt the Blessed One takes from the tip of his fingernail is less, much less, a great deal less, entirely less.

Drawing on all he had heard, he taught them the Dharma so that they abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship, becoming arhats free of attachment to the three realms, for whom filth was equal to gold, who knew space like the palm of their hands, whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood, whose knowledge had rent open the shell. They attained knowledge, clairvoyance, and discerning wisdom. They turned their backs on worldly gain, desires, and esteem and were venerated, honored, and saluted by Indra and the gods who attend him. {{page:{number:178,id:UT22084-001-001-29218,folio:F.90.a}}}

At a certain point, after their youth had faded, they abdicated in favor of their relatives and went forth into the teachings of the perfectly awakened Buddha Kāśyapa.

Alighting on and cooling those in the hot hells and alighting on and warming those in the cold hells, these rays of light interrupted the various harms inflicted on those hell realm beings, prompting the denizens of hell to think, “Gentlemen, what is this? Have we died, moved on, and taken birth elsewhere?” 
{{milestone:{label:4.75,id:UT22084-001-001-1554}}}To engender faith in them, the Blessed One sent an emanation which, when they saw it, prompted them to think, “Gentlemen, we have not died and moved on, nor have we been born elsewhere. Rather, the various harms inflicted on us have been interrupted by a being we have never seen before.”
{{milestone:{label:4.76,id:UT22084-001-001-1555}}}Through the faith they felt in the emanation, the karma that led them to experience the hell realms was exhausted and they took rebirth as gods or humans, forms in which they became fit vessels for the truth.

If the Blessed One was about to foretell actions of the past, the rays of light would fade into the space behind the Blessed One. If the Blessed One was about to foretell actions of the future, the rays of light would fade into the space before the Blessed One. If the Blessed One was about to foretell rebirth as a hell realm being, the rays of light would fade into the soles of his feet.

If the Blessed One was about to foretell rebirth as a spirit, the rays of light would fade into his big toe.

{{milestone:{label:4.86,id:UT22084-001-001-1570}}}When monks are not free from desire, it leads to saṅgha stigmata offenses. Some incur offenses in their youth and then grow old, and others incur offenses in their maturity. When such an offense occurs, the monks who retain the sūtras, retain the vinaya, and retain the mātṛkā impose, in accordance with the Dharma, a sentence{{note:{index167,id:UT22084-001-001-1571}}} on the offender. The offender must serve the saṅgha while undergoing his full probation and penance. According to some, this service includes providing the saṅgha with drinks. According to others, it includes fanning them. 
{{milestone:{label:4.87,id:UT22084-001-001-1573}}}At a certain point, the householder from Śrāvastī saw a spread of fine shelters with choice food laid out for the community and thought, “Though there is some good to their teaching, there are flaws too—they lack honor and respect for those elders they put to work.”

They replied, “What would you say if someone much more distinguished than you were to go forth and we put even him to work?”
The householder thought, “If I were to go forth, they would also put me to work. I must find some way around it.”
{{milestone:{label:4.91,id:UT22084-001-001-1583}}}As the householder was possessed of a natural intelligence, while in the monks’ company he learned how to conduct himself. Having learned that, he set off for a remote land, where he shaved off his hair and beard, donned saffron robes, and settled down. 
{{milestone:{label:4.92,id:UT22084-001-001-1584}}}After a time, monks who were paying homage to stūpas passed by. When the pilgrims saw him they said, “Elder, in Śrāvastī there resides one who is verily a lord of Dharma. Around him, gods are always appearing in the flesh. Vast lights also appear, divine sounds are heard, as are the auguries of all-knowing beings, and the two forms of wealth—material wealth and the wealth of Dharma—are to be had. Why then do you not go to Śrāvastī?”
“Venerables, I shall remain right here.”

{{milestone:{label:4.116,id:UT22084-001-001-1628}}}“Son, a single life’s suffering is easy to bear, that of many lifetimes is not. If you take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the Blessed One, but then do not properly heed them, you will have to endure suffering as a denizen in the hell realms for a long time to come.”
{{milestone:{label:4.117,id:UT22084-001-001-1629}}}The young nāga thought, “What suffering could be worse than my present suffering? I shall take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the Blessed One.”
Conjuring up the appearance of a brahmin, he set off for Jetavana, where he saw monks applying themselves to and abiding in meditation, recitation, yoga, and concentration. Upon seeing them, he felt faith and thought, “Oh my! Should I first take refuge and adopt the precepts or go forth?”
{{milestone:{label:4.118,id:UT22084-001-001-1631}}}On thinking it over, he decided, “I shall go forth,” and with that he approached a monk and said, “Noble one, I want to go forth.”
“As I am new, you should go to someone else, an elder.”
“Noble one, I do not know anyone else. This is my first time in the presence of a noble being, so I ask you, please, introduce me to a monk.”
{{milestone:{label:4.119,id:UT22084-001-001-1634}}}As the new monk’s preceptor was a hermit living in the forest, the monk took the nāga disguised as a brahmin to see him and said, “Preceptor, as this noble son wants to go forth, I ask that you allow him to go forth.”
The preceptor replied, “My dear sir, the Blessed One said, ‘Monks, one could accept being pressed into work as a butcher, but it is not right to leave the life once you have gone forth and been ordained.’ This brahmin would go to the hells {{page:{number:191,id:UT22084-001-001-29231,folio:F.96.b}}} and I too would fall, so I will not ordain him.”
{{milestone:{label:4.120,id:UT22084-001-001-1636}}}“Please, preceptor,” the monk replied, “all you need do is allow his going forth and I shall undertake to train and instruct him.”
After the preceptor had allowed the nāga’s going forth and ordained him, the preceptor said to the monk, “My dear sir, you and he now share a preceptor. As his instructor, you must quiz him, you must instruct him, and you must train him.”
{{milestone:{label:4.121,id:UT22084-001-001-1638}}}The monk recited the Ekottarikāgama{{note:{index173,id:UT22084-001-001-1639}}} and then had the nāga repeat it. As he did so with great vigor, it took on the cadence of a prayer. The monk instructor’s eyes lit up with joy and the monk said to the nāga disguised as a brahmin, “My dear sir, shall we seek alms together or on our own?”
{{milestone:{label:4.122,id:UT22084-001-001-1640}}}The nāga disguised as a brahmin thought, “I cannot live on the things humans eat; I had better return to the land of nāgas, where I can imbibe ambrosia, and return once I’ve eaten.” 
“Instructor, let us seek them on our own.”
“Very well, my dear sir,” replied the monk. 
{{milestone:{label:4.123,id:UT22084-001-001-1643}}}The nāga would drink the ambrosia of the gods in the land of nāgas and then return. As nāgas require a lot of sleep, he would soon fall into slumber. The monk would return later from his alms round as the nāga was rising from his nap. 
{{milestone:{label:4.124,id:UT22084-001-001-1644}}}One day, the monk received alms right away, took them, and headed home. As he drew near, he heard a sound, like a smith pumping his bellows, coming from his hut. Looking through the keyhole, he saw the entire hut filled with the coiled up body of a nāga and cried out, “A shape shifter! A shape shifter!” 
{{milestone:{label:4.125,id:UT22084-001-001-1646}}}Understanding well what such words meant, the nāga hastily transformed, cloaking his natural appearance and reverting to his conjured look. Monks gathered around and asked him, “What is the matter?”
“He’s a shape shifter,” the monk replied.
{{milestone:{label:4.126,id:UT22084-001-001-1648}}}They said, {{page:{number:192,id:UT22084-001-001-29232,folio:F.97.a}}} “This venerable applies himself diligently, always making an effort in his recitations. Why do you begrudge him?”
“I do not begrudge him in the least. It is just that he’s a shape shifter.”
{{milestone:{label:4.127,id:UT22084-001-001-1650}}}While they were conferring, the Blessed One passed by and inquired, “What is the matter?”
“Blessed One, he’s a shape shifter.”
{{milestone:{label:4.128,id:UT22084-001-001-1652}}}The Blessed One replied, “A shape shifter will not take root in this Dharma and Vinaya; therefore, you must banish shape shifters from this Dharma and Vinaya. If someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you, ask him, ‘You are not a shape shifter, are you?’ If you allow going forth without asking this, a breach occurs. 
{{milestone:{label:4.129,id:UT22084-001-001-1653}}}“Monks, a nāga’s nature is characterized by five things; the rest are emanations. What are these five? Nāgas are born a natural birth, they die a natural death, they sleep a natural sleep, they are nourished naturally, and they procreate naturally—these are the qualities they exhibit.”
The Blessed One said to the nāga, “My dear sir, with this body of yours you cannot attain any of a host of qualities, so leave and do no harm to the monks.”
{{milestone:{label:4.130,id:UT22084-001-001-1656}}}The nāga, not knowing where he might wind up, eventually came upon a forest of śāla trees,  where he conjured up a monastery with a high gate, skylights, and latticed windows. It was adorned with balustrades, beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye, with a staircase to the upper level, and perfectly outfitted with beds, seats, and supplies. To arriving monks and departing monks, he provided all the supplies they needed.{{note:{index174,id:UT22084-001-001-1657}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.131,id:UT22084-001-001-1658}}}After passing the rainy season at the monastery, an old-timer left for Śrāvastī, {{page:{number:193,id:UT22084-001-001-29233,folio:F.97.b}}} where, as was their wont, the group of six disciples thought, “Here, it is we who teach the Dharma to the brahmins and householders that come and assemble. It is we who trounce our adversaries and it is we who spread the fame of our order.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.132,id:UT22084-001-001-1659}}}As the group of six did whatever their self-appointed duties called for, they would never leave the gate into Jetavana unattended. Upananda rose early one morning, cast aside his toothbrush, donned his orange ceremonial robe, and took up his post at the gate into Jetavana. When he saw, approaching off in the distance, an old-timer with a head as white as an āgati flower and drooping eyebrows, Upananda thought, “No doubt this is one of our elder monks.”
{{milestone:{label:4.133,id:UT22084-001-001-1660}}}Going out to greet him, he said, “Welcome, elder, welcome.”
“Homage to you, instructor,” replied the old-timer.
{{milestone:{label:4.134,id:UT22084-001-001-133535}}}Upananda thought, “My! Why, I don’t recognize this old-timer as one of our instructors, nor do I recognize him as one of our preceptors.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.135,id:UT22084-001-001-1663}}}Upananda then asked him, “Old-timer, where have you come from?”
“From the śāla forest.”
{{milestone:{label:4.136,id:UT22084-001-001-133536}}}“Why? Is there a monastery there?”
“Yes, there is.”
{{milestone:{label:4.137,id:UT22084-001-001-1667}}}“What type is it?”
“Oh, it is but a poor one.”
{{milestone:{label:4.138,id:UT22084-001-001-133537}}}“What is it like? How is it poor? If it is fully outfitted, it is a monastery, but if it lacks all the trappings, it is poor.”
“It is a monastery.”
{{milestone:{label:4.139,id:UT22084-001-001-1671}}}“What’s there?”
“A monk caretaker lives there and provides arriving monks and departing monks with all the supplies they need.”
{{milestone:{label:4.140,id:UT22084-001-001-1673}}}As was their wont, when one among the group of six heard the slightest news they all gathered in the afternoon to discuss it.

“A monk caretaker lives there and provides arriving monks and departing monks with all the supplies they need. Come, let us pay a visit.”
{{milestone:{label:4.143,id:UT22084-001-001-1678}}}The expelled nāga, who was now disguised as an elderly monk caretaker, saw the six approaching from off in the distance, and thought, “So those rogues have come here. How would they treat me if I were to provide them with all the supplies they need?” 
{{milestone:{label:4.144,id:UT22084-001-001-133539}}}With that thought, he allocated, in order of seniority, canopied beds and terraced cottages and provided them with all the supplies they needed.
{{milestone:{label:4.145,id:UT22084-001-001-1680}}}A few days after they had settled in, they said, “Nanda and Upananda, this old-timer has no obvious source of income, nor any obvious record of allocations. We should make him account for what is here.”
{{milestone:{label:4.146,id:UT22084-001-001-133540}}}They said to him, “Old-timer, you have no obvious source of income, nor any obvious record of allocations. Come and account for them.”
{{milestone:{label:4.147,id:UT22084-001-001-1682}}}“Noble ones,” he replied, “are you merely displeased or utterly disappointed?”
“We are not just ‘merely displeased,’ for our fellow brahmacārin would denounce us if it were said, ‘The group of six passed the rainy season at that very monastery and yet they know nothing of its income and know nothing of its allocations.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:4.148,id:UT22084-001-001-1684}}}“Elders, I will comply. How long must I keep records? Twelve years?” 
“Old-Timer, in twelve years even the doors of this temple will have collapsed.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.149,id:UT22084-001-001-133541}}}“How about seven years?”
“That’s impracticable.”

“Still impracticable.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.151,id:UT22084-001-001-133542}}}“How about seven days?”
The group declared, “Nanda and Upananda, record whatever supplies this old-timer receives over the next seven days. Old-timer, {{page:{number:195,id:UT22084-001-001-29235,folio:F.98.b}}} we order you to comply.”
{{milestone:{label:4.152,id:UT22084-001-001-1692}}}The nāga, disguised as the old-timer, thought, “I shall make this monastery disappear once the seven-day period is up.” 
To some of our poorer fellow brahmacārin, the nāga proceeded to offer mantles, to some upper robes, to some under robes, to some undershirts, to some begging bowls, and to some small plates.{{note:{index175,id:UT22084-001-001-1694}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.153,id:UT22084-001-001-1695}}}When the group of six saw this they said, “Nanda and Upananda, investigate this old-timer and after seven days, evict him along with his partisans.”
After seven days had passed, the old-timer made the monastery vanish as the group of six slept, and fled to the seashore. 
The group of six, who awoke from their sleep on a piece of dry ground, said, “Nanda and Upananda, get up and fetch some chalk so we may check the accounts.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.154,id:UT22084-001-001-1698}}}When they noticed they had been sleeping on a piece of dry ground, they realized, “We have opposed one who trusted in the Blessed One and served the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, causing him to flee and make his monastery disappear.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.155,id:UT22084-001-001-1699}}}When the monks asked the Blessed One, “Who was this being? A god, a nāga, a yakṣa?” the Blessed One replied, “That monk caretaker was a shape shifter and yet this was so: if the group of six had not opposed him, he would have served the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha for as long as the teachings remained.”
{{milestone:{label:4.156,id:UT22084-001-001-1700}}}The Blessed One reflected, “All those shortcomings ensue from the monks’ forcing him to account for the monastery’s income and allocations that had no obvious source or recipient.”
{{milestone:{label:4.157,id:UT22084-001-001-1701}}}The Blessed One then decreed, “A monk should not be forced to account for income and allocations with no obvious source and recipients.

{{milestone:{label:4.158,id:UT22084-001-001-1702}}}After his encounter with the group of six, the shape-shifting nāga fled to the seashore, where he conjured up a second monastery with a high gate, skylights, and latticed windows. It too was adorned with balustrades, beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye, with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds, seats, and supplies. Ocean nāgas, in the guise of brahmins and householders, gathered there and listened to the shape-shifting nāga teach the Dharma.

{{milestone:{label:4.179,id:UT22084-001-001-1740}}}Buddharakṣita, a wealthy householder with much riches and goods who lived in Śrāvastī, took a wife of equal caste and together they played with, took pleasure in, and amused one another.
Looking to guide them, the venerable Śāriputra went to their house and enjoined the householder and his wife to seek refuge and pledge to uphold the precepts. Some time afterwards, the householder’s wife conceived a child.
{{milestone:{label:4.180,id:UT22084-001-001-1742}}} Knowing this being was certain to become one of the fortunate, the venerable Śāriputra visited the family without any ascetic followers in his wake. Prostrating at his feet, the householder asked, “Does the noble one have no ascetic followers?”
“Householder,” he replied, “do you think my ascetic followers simply sprout up like weeds? It’s those who issue from people like you who become my ascetic followers.”
{{milestone:{label:4.181,id:UT22084-001-001-1744}}}“Noble one, my spouse has conceived a child. If she should give birth to a boy, I will offer him as an ascetic follower to the noble one.”
“Householder, I accept.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.182,id:UT22084-001-001-1746}}}After eight or nine months had passed a boy was born, well proportioned, pleasing to the eye, {{page:{number:200,id:UT22084-001-001-29240,folio:F.101.a}}} handsome, radiant, with a golden complexion, a head shaped well like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, and a prominent nose. 
Three weeks, or twenty-one days, after the birth, relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style, during which time they discussed what name should be chosen for the boy. Some said, “Since the boy is Buddharakṣita’s son, the boy should be named Saṅgharakṣita,” and thus he was named Saṅgharakṣita. 
{{milestone:{label:4.183,id:UT22084-001-001-1748}}}Fortified with milk, curd, butter, ghee, cream, and other nourishing foods, the boy Saṅgharakṣita grew quickly, shooting up like a lotus in a pond. On the very day Saṅgharakṣita was born, that same day sons were also born to five hundred merchants, each of whom was given a name appropriate to his patrilineage.
{{milestone:{label:4.184,id:UT22084-001-001-1749}}}In time the boy Saṅgharakṣita grew up and the venerable Śāriputra knew it was time to allow his going forth. So, looking to guide them, he went alone without any ascetic followers in his wake to the boy’s house. After prostrating at Śāriputra’s feet, the householder Buddharakṣita laid out a seat and invited the venerable Śāriputra to sit. As he sat, Śāriputra signaled to prompt the householder Buddharakṣita. The householder Buddharakṣita then said to Saṅgharakṣita, “Son, when you were in your mother’s womb, before you were even born, I offered you as an ascetic follower to the noble Śāriputra. Go and serve him.”
{{milestone:{label:4.185,id:UT22084-001-001-1750}}}As this was to be Saṅgharakṣita’s last life as a sentient being, a smile had already spread across his face and, without apprehension, neither crestfallen nor gloomy, he pledged to do as he was told.

“Gentlemen, the ocean is full of many terrors. So those of us that journey across the ocean would do well to ask for the company of a noble one who might teach us the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:4.187,id:UT22084-001-001-1753}}}Beginning their search, they asked, “Who shall we ask to come?”

Therefore, noble one, we ask that you come with us across the ocean.” 
“Gentlemen,” he replied, “as I am not at liberty to do as I please, you should put your request to my preceptor.”

So if we set out upon the ocean, {{page:{number:202,id:UT22084-001-001-29242,folio:F.102.a}}} an ocean full of many terrors, we would do well were the noble one to teach Dharma to those of us crossing the ocean.

{{milestone:{label:4.191,id:UT22084-001-001-1760}}}The Blessed One considered whether or not these merchants had any meager roots of virtue and saw that they did. Considering who their awakening hinged on, he saw that it hinged on the monk Saṅgharakṣita. The Blessed One then said to the venerable Saṅgharakṣita, “Saṅgharakṣita, you shall go on this journey across the ocean and face your fears along with what provokes them.”
{{milestone:{label:4.192,id:UT22084-001-001-1761}}}With his silence, the venerable Saṅgharakṣita assented to the Blessed One. After performing rites for protection, good luck, and success, the five hundred merchants together with the venerable Saṅgharakṣita carried their goods to the ocean in carts, on poles, in baskets and hampers, and on camels, bullocks, {{page:{number:203,id:UT22084-001-001-29243,folio:F.102.b}}} and donkeys. Setting out for the ocean, they passed in stages through villages, towns, countryside, kingdoms, and markets until they reached the ocean shore, where they paused to recover from the weariness of the road. For five hundred denarii they obtained a ship and hired five hundred crew members to serve as stewards, cleaning staff, divers, deck hands, and riggers. After calling out three times,{{note:{index177,id:UT22084-001-001-1762}}} they set out upon the ocean in pursuit of riches. 
{{milestone:{label:4.193,id:UT22084-001-001-1763}}}Part of the way into their voyage, they and their seafaring ship were held up by nāgas. The merchants began to implore Śiva, Varuṇa, Kubera, Śakra, Brahmā, and other gods, “Whoever it is that dwells here, be they gods, nāgas, yakṣas, or gandharvas, may they tell us what they desire!”
From the ocean there came a voice, saying, “Give us the noble Saṅgharakṣita!” 
“The noble Saṅgharakṣita is our peer. We grew up together playing in the dirt with him. The Blessed One and the venerable Śāriputra have entrusted him to us, so we would sooner die and face our death with him than turn him over.”
{{milestone:{label:4.194,id:UT22084-001-001-1766}}}The venerable Saṅgharakṣita said to them, “What are you talking about, gentlemen?”
“Noble one,” they replied, “a voice from the ocean has said, ‘Give us the noble Saṅgharakṣita!’ ”
“Why do you not give me over?”
{{milestone:{label:4.195,id:UT22084-001-001-1769}}}“Noble one, you are our peer. We grew up together playing in the dirt with you.

The venerable Saṅgharakṣita thought, “This must be what the Blessed One meant when he said to me, ‘Saṅgharakṣita, you shall go on this journey across the ocean and face your fears along with what provokes them.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:4.196,id:UT22084-001-001-1771}}}Taking up his begging bowl and robe, he prepared to jump into the sea. Seeing him prepare to jump, the merchants shouted, “Noble Saṅgharakṣita! What are you doing? What are you doing?”
As they tried to stop him, Saṅgharakṣita jumped into the sea and at the very moment he did so, the nāgas released the ship. Taking the venerable Saṅgharakṣita, the nāgas returned to the land of the nāgas. 
{{milestone:{label:4.197,id:UT22084-001-001-1773}}}Smiling at one another, the nāgas and their nāga women watched in amazement as they invited the venerable Saṅgharakṣita to pay homage to a set of shrines, saying, “Noble Saṅgharakṣita, this shall be the sanctuary of the perfectly awakened Buddha Vipaśyin, while these shall be the sanctuaries of the perfectly awakened Buddhas Śikhin, Viśvabhū, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kāśyapa. This shall be the sanctuary of the Blessed One Śākyamuni.”{{note:{index178,id:UT22084-001-001-1774}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.198,id:UT22084-001-001-1775}}}After prostrating to the shrines with them, Saṅgharakṣita sat on the seat they had arranged at the center of the assembled nāgas. The nāgas joined their palms and supplicated him: “Noble Saṅgharakṣita, though the Blessed One’s sūtras and mātṛkā have taken root among gods and humans, we nāgas were born into this cursed state with fallen forms! O noble one, please see that the ultimate sūtras take root among us!”
Saṅgharakṣita assented with the words, “I shall do just that.”
{{milestone:{label:4.199,id:UT22084-001-001-1777}}}The shape shifter who had fled his seaside monastery for the land of the nāgas after being confronted by the group of six then chose three nāga youths and said to the first, “You shall memorize {{page:{number:205,id:UT22084-001-001-29245,folio:F.103.b}}} the Saṃyuktāgama.” 
To the second he said, “You shall memorize the Madhyamāgama.”
To the third he said, “You shall memorize the Dīrghāgama. The nāgas can learn how to recite the Ekottarikāgama by listening to me recite it.”{{note:{index179,id:UT22084-001-001-1780}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.200,id:UT22084-001-001-1781}}}When the young nāgas began to recite, the first closed his eyes as he sought to memorize the Saṃyuktāgama, the second turned his back as he sought to memorize the Madhyamāgama, while the third sat off in the distance as he sought to memorize the Dīrghāgama. 
{{milestone:{label:4.201,id:UT22084-001-001-1782}}}Because the shape shifter had greater exposure to Buddhist customs than the others, he was respectful, deferential, and came first to all of their chores. He would rise early and say, “Noble ones, get up and brush your teeth. Pay homage to the gathering of blessed ones and their shrines. Eat and make the bed.”
{{milestone:{label:4.202,id:UT22084-001-001-1783}}}Once, as they were all reciting their respective Āgamas, the shape shifter said, “Noble one, if nāga youths recite the Āgamas, will they remember them or not?”
Saṅgharakṣita replied, “Even if with their good memories they remember them, they still have certain flaws.”
{{milestone:{label:4.203,id:UT22084-001-001-1785}}}“Noble one,” the shape shifter asked, “what are their failings?”
“They lack respect and deference. The first closes his eyes as he seeks to memorize the Saṃyuktāgama, the second turns his back as he seeks to memorize the Madhyamāgama, while the third sits off in the distance as he seeks to memorize the Dīrghāgama. You alone are respectful, deferential, and come first to all of your chores.”
{{milestone:{label:4.204,id:UT22084-001-001-1787}}}“Noble one,” the shape shifter replied, “it is not that they lack respect and deference. The one who closes his eyes as he seeks to memorize the Saṃyuktāgama has noxious eyes that burn; the one who turns his back as he seeks to memorize the Madhyamāgama has noxious breath; and the one who sits off in the distance as he seeks to memorize the Dīrghāgama{{page:{number:206,id:UT22084-001-001-29246,folio:F.104.a}}} has a noxious touch. I myself have noxious fangs.”
{{milestone:{label:4.205,id:UT22084-001-001-1788}}} Frightened, the venerable Saṅgharakṣita thought, “Look! I am living among my mortal enemies,” and he grew pallid, emaciated, feeble, withered, thin, and weak. 
The shape-shifting nāga asked, “Noble one, why have you become pallid, emaciated, feeble, withered, thin, and weak?”
“I am among enemies so the moment I do anything to upset you, I shall be reduced to naught but a memory.”
{{milestone:{label:4.206,id:UT22084-001-001-1791}}}“We do not intend to harm the noble one. However, given the situation, does the noble one wish to return to Jambudvīpa?”
“My dear sir, I do. I do not care for this place.”
The nāgas discussed the matter among themselves and when the noble Saṅgharakṣita’s ship passed by on its return journey, they raised him from the waters and placed him on board the ship.
{{milestone:{label:4.207,id:UT22084-001-001-1794}}} Smiles broke out upon the merchants’ faces as they stared in amazement and cried out, “Welcome back, noble Saṅgharakṣita, welcome back!”
Saṅgharakṣita said, “Gentlemen! Rejoice, for I have seen to it that the Four Āgamas have taken root in the land of nāgas!”
“Noble one, we do! We rejoice in this good you have done for others, for this is the job of those who go forth.”
{{milestone:{label:4.208,id:UT22084-001-001-1797}}}Reunited and happy, the merchants and the venerable Saṅgharakṣita completed the journey back to shore. On arriving, all were tired and weary. As his companions slept, the venerable Saṅgharakṣita turned his gaze to the ocean. {{page:{number:207,id:UT22084-001-001-29247,folio:F.104.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.209,id:UT22084-001-001-1798}}}The Blessed One has said, “Monks, there are five things one never tires of looking at and which are in no way displeasing to the eye. What are the five? One never tires of looking at a clever and youthful elephant; a king of the world; the ocean with its monsters; Sumeru, the king of mountains; and a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened buddha—these five things are in no way displeasing to the eye.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.210,id:UT22084-001-001-1799}}}Saṅgharakṣita gazed long at the ocean until just before dawn when, fatigued, he was overcome by a deep sleep. Not long after, the merchants loaded the pack animals and set out. But because it was in the wee hours of the morning, they could not see the venerable Saṅgharakṣita and they began to look and ask one another, “Gentlemen, what has happened to the noble Saṅgharakṣita?” 
{{milestone:{label:4.211,id:UT22084-001-001-1800}}}Some suggested he had gone ahead while others said he was still coming from behind and still others said he was traveling in the middle of the caravan. After searching everywhere to no avail, they gave up. Dispirited and downcast, they said, “Gentlemen, it is not good that we have left the noble Saṅgharakṣita behind. We must turn around.”
{{milestone:{label:4.212,id:UT22084-001-001-1801}}}But then, on reflection, it occurred to them, “The noble Saṅgharakṣita possesses miraculous powers and great might. If he did not meet his end in the ocean, how could he meet his end while traveling on dry land? With his miraculous powers and great might, he must have gone far ahead of us and be waiting there now.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.213,id:UT22084-001-001-1802}}}With the call, “Gentlemen, come, let us go!” they set out.

{{milestone:{label:4.214,id:UT22084-001-001-1804}}}When the sun rose, its rays struck the venerable Saṅgharakṣita as he lay asleep on the empty, sandy beach, waking him from his slumber. Seeing no one around, he thought, “What will I do if the merchants have left? They might have gone in any direction!”
{{milestone:{label:4.215,id:UT22084-001-001-1805}}}With great courage, the venerable Saṅgharakṣita set out but he could see no trail. {{page:{number:208,id:UT22084-001-001-29248,folio:F.105.a}}} After searching about, he spied a narrow path and set off upon it. After a time, he saw, in a forest of śāla trees, a monastery with a high gate, skylights, and latticed windows. It was adorned with balustrades, beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye, with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds, seats, and supplies. It was surrounded by a variety of trees, and graced with pools and ponds, ringing with the sounds of swans, cranes, peacocks, parrots, mynahs, and cuckoos. When he saw the monks, finely dressed and well trained, living peacefully in this glorious and heavenly abode, he respectfully approached them. 
{{milestone:{label:4.216,id:UT22084-001-001-1806}}} With a show of respect, they said to him, “Welcome, reverend Saṅgharakṣita, welcome. From where have you come just now?”
After he explained everything that had happened, they let him rest and once he recovered from the fatigue of the road, they led him into the monastery.  Once there, he saw that fine seats had been arranged and choice foods laid out. They asked him, “Reverend Saṅgharakṣita, are you not thirsty? Are you not hungry?”
{{milestone:{label:4.217,id:UT22084-001-001-1808}}}“Venerables,” he replied, “I am thirsty and I am hungry.”

Some time later, the meal was laid out and when the gaṇḍī beam was struck, the monks filed in, each carrying his own begging bowl, and sat down in order of seniority. As soon as they sat down, the monastery vanished {{page:{number:209,id:UT22084-001-001-29249,folio:F.105.b}}} and each of their begging bowls turned into iron clubs of different sorts. For the remainder of the meal, they bludgeoned each other over the head with their iron clubs, cracking their skulls open and inflicting unbearable pain that caused them to cry out pitifully.

But as far as the wealth of Dharma is concerned, ours is better. So I shall go forth and take my meals here while taking my Dharma among my fellow tīrthika.”
{{milestone:{label:4.331,id:UT22084-001-001-2004}}}With that thought, he approached a monk and said, “Noble one, I want to go forth”; his going forth was allowed, and he was granted ordination.

“No.”

“Who are your fellow brahmacārin?”
“The tīrthikas, for I enjoy my food with you and my Dharma with them.”

{{milestone:{label:4.356,id:UT22084-001-001-2058}}}On hearing this verse, the lad thought, “Ah! Even wrongdoing can be checked! I shall go forth among these people.” He then approached the monk and said, “Noble one, I want to go forth.”
After his going forth was allowed and he was ordained, he applied himself diligently and began to recite the scriptures. In reciting and saying prayers, he recited and memorized the Three Piṭakas and gained the confidence born of knowledge and freedom. 
{{milestone:{label:4.357,id:UT22084-001-001-2060}}}The monks asked him, “Venerable, what motivates such diligence in you?”
“I must expunge a wrongdoing,” he replied.
“What wrongdoing are you guilty of?”
“I killed my mother.”
“Your wet nurse or the woman who gave birth to you?”
“My birth mother.”
{{milestone:{label:4.358,id:UT22084-001-001-2064}}}The monks asked the Blessed One about it, and he said to the monks, “Monks, a person who has killed his mother is fit to be excluded from the community, for a person who has killed his mother will not take root in this Dharma and Vinaya. For that reason, monks, you should exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who have killed their mothers. If someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you, you should ask, ‘Are you a matricide?’ If you allow going forth without asking this, a breach occurs.”
{{milestone:{label:4.359,id:UT22084-001-001-2067}}}The monk who had killed his mother thought, {{page:{number:242,id:UT22084-001-001-29282,folio:F.122.a}}} “Where will I wind up? I must go into the wilds.” And with that, he went into the wilds, where a householder became his follower. Out of deep devotion, the householder had a monastery erected for the monk, where monks from various regions and lands came to live, many of whom went on to actualize arhatship under his guidance. 
{{milestone:{label:4.360,id:UT22084-001-001-2068}}}Sometime later, the monk matricide fell ill. Although the other monks ministered to him with medicinal roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruits, he continued to get worse. The monk matricide then told his wards, “Venerables, prepare a dry sauna for the saṅgha and for me.”
His monk apprentices then prepared a dry sauna for him. 
{{milestone:{label:4.361,id:UT22084-001-001-2070}}}All accumulation ends in depletion;
All climbs end in falls; 
All meetings end in separation;
All life ends in death.
{{milestone:{label:4.362,id:UT22084-001-001-2071}}}So his time came and he died, and he was reborn among the denizens of Avīci, the Great Hell of Unrelenting Torment. One of his arhat wards entered into meditation to find out where his preceptor had been reborn and began searching for him among the gods, but he did not see him there. Nor did he see him when he looked among humans, animals, and spirits. When he began to search among the denizens of hell, he saw that his preceptor had been reborn among the denizens of Avīci, the Great Hell of Unrelenting Torment.
{{milestone:{label:4.363,id:UT22084-001-001-2072}}}The arhat ward wondered, “If my preceptor was ethical, learned, and attracted a following with the Dharma, what did he do that it should lead him to be reborn among the denizens of Avīci?”  He then saw that it was matricide. 
Struck by the fiery light of Avīci, the monk matricide cried, “Oh! The heat in this dry sauna is too much!” As soon as he cried out, the guardians of hell lifted their maces and clubbed him on the head, shouting, “Hapless fool! Where is this dry sauna of yours? This is Avīci, the Great Hell of Unrelenting Torment!” {{page:{number:243,id:UT22084-001-001-29283,folio:F.122.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.364,id:UT22084-001-001-2074}}}This virtuous thought{{note:{index195,id:UT22084-001-001-2075}}} brought the former monk matricide’s time in hell to an end, and he was reborn among the gods in the realms of the Four Great Kings. It is in the nature of gods and goddesses to have three thoughts shortly after birth: where they have passed on from, where they have been born, and what action has caused that rebirth. Thus the former monk matricide saw he had passed from among the denizens of hell and been reborn among the gods in the realms of the Four Great Kings due to his having washed the dry sauna for the saṅgha. 
{{milestone:{label:4.365,id:UT22084-001-001-2076}}}Then the young god, who had formerly been a denizen of hell, had this thought: “It would not be right of me to spend a day here without going to see and pay my respects to the Blessed One. Thus, before the day is out, I shall go to see and pay my respects to the Blessed One.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.366,id:UT22084-001-001-2077}}}The young god donned a pair of glittering hooped earrings that swung to and fro, adorned his body with two pearl necklaces, one long and one medium in length, filled the folds of his skirt with the dazzling colors of divine blue lotus flowers, lotuses, water lilies, and white lotuses, and when night had fallen, set out to see the Blessed One. On his arrival, he strewed the flowers before the Blessed One and bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet before taking a place off to one side. The colors of the young god filled the whole of Jetavana with a great light. 
{{milestone:{label:4.367,id:UT22084-001-001-2078}}}As the young god sat on a seat, the Blessed One intuited his thoughts, propensities, disposition, and nature and proceeded to teach the Dharma he needed to hear in order to fully realize each of the Noble Ones’ four truths, thus actualizing the fruit of a stream enterer by decimating with the lightning bolt of wisdom the mountain of belief in the transient aggregates with its twenty tall peaks. {{page:{number:244,id:UT22084-001-001-29284,folio:F.123.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.368,id:UT22084-001-001-2079}}} Upon seeing the truth, the young god spoke this panegyric thrice: “Reverend, what the Blessed One has done for me, my father did not do for me, nor did my mother, nor did the king, nor did the gods, nor did my ancestors, nor did ascetics or brahmins, nor did my circle of loved ones and friends, nor did my forebears. For the Blessed One has dried up the ocean of blood and tears, freed me from mountains of bones, shut the door to miserable realms, opened the door to higher realms and liberation, dragged me up by the leg from among the denizens of hell, animals, and spirits, and installed me among gods and humans.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.369,id:UT22084-001-001-2080}}}The young god spoke again:
“Because of you, the path to miserable realms 
Of terrible and diverse punishments is blocked
And the road to higher realms of great merit has opened.
I have even found the way to nirvāṇa. 
{{milestone:{label:4.370,id:UT22084-001-001-2082}}}“By relying on you, one of utter purity,
I have today gained flawless, pure vision,

{{milestone:{label:4.371,id:UT22084-001-001-2083}}}“Honored in the world by demi-gods, gods, and men;

Circling the one who has tamed his enemies
I turn to the heavens and fly into the sky.”
{{milestone:{label:4.373,id:UT22084-001-001-2085}}}The young god then departed like a trader who has made a profit, a farmer who has reaped his crops, a warrior who has won a battle, or an ill person who has been delivered from all his ills, and, in the dress in which he arrived in the Blessed One’s presence, returned home. 
{{milestone:{label:4.374,id:UT22084-001-001-2086}}}One of the young god’s former wards, an elder in the saṅgha and an arhat, {{page:{number:245,id:UT22084-001-001-29285,folio:F.123.b}}} was seated in the meal row, while another of his wards  was distributing water to the saṅgha. After a time, the saṅgha elder lifted his cup of water. It felt extremely cold to the touch of the tip of his fingers, and he thought, “While we drink water as cold as this, the preceptor drinks molten copper among the denizens of Avīci, the Great Hell of Unrelenting Torment.”
{{milestone:{label:4.375,id:UT22084-001-001-2087}}}Yet when this arhat elder then searched for his preceptor among the denizens of Avīci, the Great Hell of Unrelenting Torment, his preceptor was nowhere to be seen. When the arhat elder searched for him among the animals, spirits, and denizens of other hells, he was nowhere to be seen there either. And so he began to search for him among the gods. There he saw that his preceptor had been reborn among the gods in the realm of the Four Great Kings and, having become a god, saw the truth in the Blessed One’s presence before returning to remain among the gods. Smiling, the arhat elder gained faith in the Blessed One and spoke this panegyric: “O Buddha! O Dharma! O Saṅgha! O the well-spoken Dharma by which even wrongdoers led into such fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities!” 
{{milestone:{label:4.376,id:UT22084-001-001-2088}}}A student of the same preceptor saw him looking jubilant, pleased, and overjoyed and asked, “Venerable, are you so jubilant, pleased, and overjoyed by the thought that now that the preceptor’s time has come, you are the saṅgha elder?”
The arhat elder replied, “Venerable, now is not the time to answer your question. Ask me when we are among the saṅgha and that will prove the time to answer your question.”
{{milestone:{label:4.377,id:UT22084-001-001-2090}}} Later, after the monks of the saṅgha gathered and were seated, the saṅgha elder asked their preceptor’s student, “Venerable, what was it you wanted to ask me?”
“I asked you, ‘Venerable, are you so jubilant, pleased, {{page:{number:246,id:UT22084-001-001-29286,folio:F.124.a}}} and overjoyed by the thought that now that the preceptor’s time has come, you are the saṅgha elder?’ ” 
{{milestone:{label:4.378,id:UT22084-001-001-2092}}}While seated among the saṅgha, the arhat elder explained the situation at length to his fellow student. His fellow student then also rejoiced, as did the saṅgha, who spoke this panegyric: “O Buddha! O Dharma! O Saṅgha! O the well-spoken Dharma by which even wrongdoers led into fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities!”

{{milestone:{label:4.379,id:UT22084-001-001-2093}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī, when a householder living in Śrāvastī took a wife of equal caste and together they played with, took pleasure in, and amused one another. The wife with whom he had played, taken pleasure, and amused himself later gave birth to a son. 
{{milestone:{label:4.380,id:UT22084-001-001-2094}}}In time, the lad went with a peer to a house, where a girl sitting on the house’s roof threw down a bouquet of flowers to catch his attention. His peer asked, “Friend, you haven’t arranged a rendezvous at this house, have you?”
“Indeed I have, and that is our signal,” the lad replied.
{{milestone:{label:4.381,id:UT22084-001-001-2097}}}“Friend, this house is ill-omened, don’t go in. I warn you, through indiscretion you will come to suffering.” 
The lad’s friend then led him on a long detour that took the entire day, eventually leading him back to his father, to whom the lad’s friend said, “Sir, your son here has arranged a rendezvous at a girl’s house. I have safeguarded him the whole day so you must safeguard him through the night. That house is ill-omened. Do not let him enter. Beware, through indiscretion he will come to suffering.”
{{milestone:{label:4.382,id:UT22084-001-001-2099}}}“Son, you have done well to inform me.”
He arranged a bed for his son in the house, along with two clay chamber pots, water, and fresh earth cover, and installed his son in the house, saying, “I myself will sleep on a cot by the door.”
{{milestone:{label:4.383,id:UT22084-001-001-2100}}}“Father, open the door.”
“Why, son?”
“I must go out to urinate.”
“Son, {{page:{number:247,id:UT22084-001-001-29287,folio:F.124.b}}} I have placed a chamber pot there. Urinate in that.”
{{milestone:{label:4.384,id:UT22084-001-001-2104}}}He sat down for a bit and then said, “Father, open the door.” 
“Why, son?”
“I must go out to defecate.”
“Son, I have placed a chamber pot, water, and fresh earth cover there. Defecate in that.”
{{milestone:{label:4.385,id:UT22084-001-001-2108}}}Again, he sat for a bit before saying, “Father, open the door.”
“Son, do you think I don’t know where you want to go? I cannot open the door for you.”
“Father, I shall kill you.”
“Son, I can face my own death, but I couldn’t bear watching my son die.”
{{milestone:{label:4.386,id:UT22084-001-001-2112}}} In the pursuit of passion, there is nothing he would not do. His mind merciless and forsaking all thought of future lives, he unsheathed his knife and cut off his father’s head at the neck, which tumbled to the floor. Having killed his father, he left, trembling like a man who has committed a sin. 
{{milestone:{label:4.387,id:UT22084-001-001-2113}}}The girl with whom he had a rendezvous said to him, “Son of a lord, there is no one, there is no other girl but me. Do not be afraid.”
{{milestone:{label:4.388,id:UT22084-001-001-2993}}}Thinking, “She will be pleased if I tell her what I’ve done,” he said, “Noble woman, I have killed my father for your sake.”
{{milestone:{label:4.389,id:UT22084-001-001-2117}}}“What? Your foster father or the man who fathered you?”
“The man who fathered me.”
The girl thought, “He has killed his father without regard for his importance to him. What chance would I stand if at some point he became angry with me?” 
{{milestone:{label:4.390,id:UT22084-001-001-2121}}}Then she said to the lad, “Son of a lord, please wait a moment while I climb up to the roof of the house.”
“Go ahead.”
On reaching the roof, she cried out, “A thief! A thief!”
{{milestone:{label:4.391,id:UT22084-001-001-2994}}}The lad, scared and frightened, fled back to his own house, and laid his knife at the doorstep before crying out, “The thief has been here! He has killed my father and fled!”
{{milestone:{label:4.392,id:UT22084-001-001-2122}}} After performing rites of veneration over his father’s corpse, the lad left home. But a person who has done wrong finds no serenity, so he sought out tīrthika communities and communities of ascetics and asked, “Gentlemen, {{page:{number:248,id:UT22084-001-001-29288,folio:F.125.a}}} what can one do to expunge an evil act?”
{{milestone:{label:4.393,id:UT22084-001-001-2995}}}To that, some said, “Immolate yourself”; some said, “Take poison”; some said, “Jump off a cliff”; some said, “Drown yourself”; and some said, “Strangle yourself with a rope.” All of them recommended some form of suicide; none could offer any means of expiation. 
Later, he went to Jetavana, where he posed his question to a monk, who recited a verse:
{{milestone:{label:4.394,id:UT22084-001-001-2125}}}“He who has done some wrong
May curb it through virtue

“I killed my father.”
“Your foster father or the man who fathered you?”
“The man who fathered me.”

A person who has killed his father will not take root in this Dharma and Vinaya. For that reason, you should exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who have killed their fathers.

{{milestone:{label:4.399,id:UT22084-001-001-2135}}}The monk who had killed his father thought, “Where will I wind up? I must go into the wilds.” And with that, he went into the wilds, where a householder became his follower. Out of deep devotion, the householder had a monastery erected for the monk, where monks from various regions and lands came to live, many of whom went on to actualize arhatship under his guidance. 
{{milestone:{label:4.400,id:UT22084-001-001-2136}}}Some time later, the monk patricide fell ill. Although the other monks ministered to him with medicinal roots, stalks, leaves, flowers and fruits, he continued to get worse. The monk patricide then told his wards, “Venerables, construct a dry sauna for the saṅgha and for me.”

His fellow student then also rejoiced, as did the saṅgha, who spoke this panegyric: “O Buddha! O Dharma! O Saṅgha! O the well-spoken Dharma by which even wrongdoers led into fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities!”

{{milestone:{label:5.1,id:UT22084-001-001-2160}}}A summary:
 Killing an arhat, causing a schism in the saṅgha, 
 Maliciously drawing blood, and 
 Suffering one of the four defeats 
 And three types of suspension.

{{milestone:{label:5.2,id:UT22084-001-001-2161}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī. When, in the thick of Yaṣṭī Grove, the Blessed One established in the truths the King of Magadha, Bimbisāra of the Guilds, along with 80,000 gods and hundreds of thousands of Magadhan brahmins and householders, Bimbisāra had the bells rung throughout his land and this pronouncement was read: “No one shall steal in my lands. If anyone does so, I will banish them and provide recompense from my own stores and treasury.”
{{milestone:{label:5.3,id:UT22084-001-001-2162}}}When the Blessed One used the analogies of the Daharopama Sūtra{{note:{index197,id:UT22084-001-001-2163}}} to subdue Prasenajit, the King of Kosala, Prasenajit too had the bells rung throughout his land and this pronouncement was read: “No one shall steal in my lands. If anyone does so, they will face capital punishment and I will provide recompense from my own stores and treasury.”
{{milestone:{label:5.4,id:UT22084-001-001-2164}}}At this, the robbers and bandits of Magadha and Kosala all moved to the borderlands. From their camps, they sacked merchant caravans traveling between Magadha and Kosala. 
{{milestone:{label:5.5,id:UT22084-001-001-2165}}}On one occasion, a caravan of merchants set out from Magadha for Kosala with an armed escort. When they reached the borderlands, {{page:{number:254,id:UT22084-001-001-29294,folio:F.128.a}}} their caravan leader said, “Gentlemen, King Prasenajit is belligerent and ruthless. And if he will recompense us our losses,  why do we pay the wages for an armed escort? The escort can turn back now.”
{{milestone:{label:5.6,id:UT22084-001-001-2166}}}The escort turned back as the caravan of traders continued, reduced in numbers. The bandits, though, had posted a lookout who was lying in wait and when he caught sight of them he asked, “Gentlemen, why do you sit indifferent when a small caravan of traders is approaching?”
{{milestone:{label:5.7,id:UT22084-001-001-2167}}}With that, the bandits set upon the caravan, taking the lives of some merchants as other merchants abandoned their goods and fled. Without reflection, arhats do not have access to prescience and insight; and so the life of an arhat traveling with the merchants was also taken. 
{{milestone:{label:5.8,id:UT22084-001-001-2168}}}Those merchants who had fled sought out King Prasenajit, their faces and bodies smeared with dirt, howling, their hair in disarray. Pressing their palms together they said, “Your Majesty, in your lands we have been reduced to a state where we are not fit to be merchants!” 
{{milestone:{label:5.9,id:UT22084-001-001-2169}}}“What happened?”
“We were sacked by bandits.”
“In what region?”
“In a region near the borderlands.”
{{milestone:{label:5.10,id:UT22084-001-001-2173}}}The king commanded his general Virūḍhaka, “Bring me the stolen goods and the bandits. And be quick about it!”
As Virūḍhaka set out at the head of the four branches of the armed forces, the bandits were sitting around unconcerned with their armor off in a śāla forest, dividing their spoils. General Virūḍhaka had them surrounded and, once the bandits were hemmed in, struck fear into their hearts with the sound of conchs and war-drums. Some of the bandits abandoned their spoils and fled while some were killed. Taking sixty of the bandits who had been captured alive, General Virūḍhaka returned to the king with the stolen goods and said, “Your Majesty, these are the bandits and these are the stolen goods.”
{{milestone:{label:5.11,id:UT22084-001-001-2175}}}The king then said to the bandits, “Gentlemen, I, the king, had the bells rung and announced, {{page:{number:255,id:UT22084-001-001-29295,folio:F.128.b}}} ‘No one shall steal in my lands. If anyone does so, they will face capital punishment and I will provide recompense from my own stores and treasury.’ Did you not hear?”
“We heard, Your Majesty.”
“Well then, why did you rob the merchants?”
“We have no other means of making a living, Your Majesty.”
{{milestone:{label:5.12,id:UT22084-001-001-2179}}}“Why did you take life?”
“To instill fear.”
“You may have instilled some fear but the fear I instill today shall be like none ever seen before.”
The king then ordered his ministers, “Gentlemen, execute all of these men today.” 
{{milestone:{label:5.13,id:UT22084-001-001-2183}}}As they were being led to the execution grounds, their sentences were proclaimed along the high roads and side streets, at intersections and crossroads. In the commotion, one bandit escaped in the midst of a crowded street and approached a monk in Jetavana and said, “Noble one, I want to go forth.”
The monk allowed the bandit’s going forth and ordained him while the other bandits were being executed. 
{{milestone:{label:5.14,id:UT22084-001-001-2185}}}The Blessed One had advised, “Monks, again and again you should be able to scrutinize your own failings, others’ failings, your own strengths, and others’ strengths. Why is that so? Because your own failings and others’ failings act as a spur to disenchantment, while your own strengths and others’ strengths also act as a spur to disenchantment.”
{{milestone:{label:5.15,id:UT22084-001-001-2186}}}In light of this advice, the monks had taken to visiting the charnel ground. When the time came for the monks to visit the charnel grounds again, the bandit turned monk accompanied them, and there he saw that the other bandits had been executed. He stood still, choked with tears. The monks said, “Venerables, though he has only newly gone forth, he has such a kind heart.”
{{milestone:{label:5.16,id:UT22084-001-001-2187}}}When he began to sob, the monks asked, “Venerable, why do you make such a fuss?”
The bandit turned monk replied, “This is my father. This is my brother. This is my uncle on my father’s side. This {{page:{number:256,id:UT22084-001-001-29296,folio:F.129.a}}} is my uncle on my mother’s side.”
“These men took the life of an arhat,” said the monks.
{{milestone:{label:5.17,id:UT22084-001-001-2190}}}When the bandit turned monk admitted they had taken the life of an arhat, the monks asked the Blessed One about it,  and the Blessed One decreed, “Monks, this person has killed an arhat. A person who has killed an arhat will not take root in this Dharma and Vinaya. Therefore, monks, you should exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who have killed an arhat. If someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you, you should ask, ‘You are not a killer of an arhat, are you?’ If you allow going forth and grant ordination without asking this, a breach occurs.”

{{milestone:{label:5.18,id:UT22084-001-001-2191}}}The venerable Upāli asked the Blessed Buddha, “Reverend, if a person who caused a schism among the Tathāgata’s saṅgha disciples in a previous ordination career again wants monkhood, to go forth and be ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, should his going forth be allowed or not?”
{{milestone:{label:5.19,id:UT22084-001-001-2192}}}“Upāli, his going forth should not be allowed. Therefore, if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you, you should ask, ‘You have not caused a schism in the saṅgha, have you?’ If you allow going forth without asking this, a breach occurs.”

{{milestone:{label:5.20,id:UT22084-001-001-2193}}}The venerable Upāli asked the Blessed Buddha, “Reverend, if a person who has maliciously drawn blood from a tathāgata wants monkhood, to go forth and be ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya in the Blessed One’s presence, should his going forth be allowed or not?”
{{milestone:{label:5.21,id:UT22084-001-001-2194}}}“Upāli, his going forth should not be allowed. Therefore, if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you, you should ask, ‘You have not maliciously drawn blood from a tathāgata, have you?’ {{page:{number:257,id:UT22084-001-001-29297,folio:F.129.b}}} If you allow going forth without asking this, a breach occurs.”
{{milestone:{label:5,id:UT22084-001-001-section-5-4}}}Suffering One of the Four Defeats
{{milestone:{label:5.22,id:UT22084-001-001-2195}}}The venerable Upāli asked the Blessed Buddha, “Reverend, if a person who has fallen by committing any of the four actions leading to defeat during a previous ordination career wants monkhood, to go forth and be ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, should his going forth be allowed or not?”
{{milestone:{label:5.23,id:UT22084-001-001-2196}}}“Upāli, his going forth should not be allowed. Therefore, if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you, you should ask, ‘You have not fallen by committing any of the four acts leading to defeat, have you?’ If you allow going forth without asking this, a breach occurs.”
{{milestone:{label:5,id:UT22084-001-001-section-5-5}}}Three Types of Suspension
{{milestone:{label:5.24,id:UT22084-001-001-2197}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī. The Blessed One then said to the monks, “Monks, if a person who has been suspended for refusing to acknowledge an offense{{note:{index198,id:UT22084-001-001-2198}}} returns and says, ‘Venerables, I acknowledge the offense. Please allow my going forth,’ then you should allow his going forth. Once he has gone forth, if he says, ‘Venerables, I confess my offense. Please grant me ordination,’ then he should be granted ordination. If perchance, after being ordained, he should say, ‘I do not acknowledge the offense,’ then, provided there is a majority within the saṅgha, he should be suspended for refusing to acknowledge the offense. In the event that there is no majority within the saṅgha and he has been ordained, the ordination is to be judged valid, for it is difficult for a person to find monkhood, to go forth and be ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya. The same conditions apply to suspensions meted out for refusing to amend one’s behavior, and suspensions meted out for refusing to give up deviant views.” {{page:{number:258,id:UT22084-001-001-29298,folio:F.130.a}}}

{{milestone:{label:6,id:UT22084-001-001-section-6-1}}}Persons whose hands have been cut off
{{milestone:{label:6.2,id:UT22084-001-001-2202}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park near Śrāvastī. As was their wont, the group of six kept as apprentices anyone whose going forth had been allowed and who had been ordained, but who could not recognize a rogue. Once the apprentices could recognize a rogue, they were entrusted as apprentices to monks of good standing. On the advice of the Teacher, they would on occasion simply look in on their apprentices. 
{{milestone:{label:6.3,id:UT22084-001-001-2203}}}When this came up in conversation, Nanda and Upananda said, “These black begging bowl carriers might as well be snatching babies! Everyone we allow to go forth, they up and snatch away! Let’s allow to go forth the sort that these black begging bowl carriers won’t snatch away.”
{{milestone:{label:6.4,id:UT22084-001-001-2204}}}Some time later, Upananda was out for a stroll  when he saw a man missing his hands and said, “Dear sir, why do you not go forth?”
He replied, “Noble one, as I have no hands, no one will allow me to go forth.”
“Dear sir, the Blessed One’s teachings are characterized by compassion. I shall allow your going forth.” And with that he allowed his going forth {{page:{number:259,id:UT22084-001-001-29299,folio:F.130.b}}} and ordination. 
{{milestone:{label:6.5,id:UT22084-001-001-2207}}}After two or three days of teaching him how Dharma practitioners conduct themselves, Upananda said, “Dear sir, game does not eat other game. The whole of Śrāvastī is your field and fatherland, so seek out alms and live on them.” 
“Preceptor, how am I to go begging alms?”
“Do you not know even that much? I will show you.”
{{milestone:{label:6.6,id:UT22084-001-001-2210}}}Upananda tied the handless monk’s under robe on with a cord, fastened his robe up with a pin, placed his begging bowl in the crook of his left arm, and nestled his khakkhara staff in the crook of his right arm. The handless monk had entered Śrāvastī on his rounds when a woman beat on his chest and cried, “Noble one! Who cut off the hands of a renunciant?”
“Sister,” he replied, “my hands were cut off when I was still a householder. They were not cut off after I went forth.”
{{milestone:{label:6.7,id:UT22084-001-001-2212}}}“Who allowed your going forth?”
“The preceptor Upananda.” 
The people said, “Who else but a rogue would allow the going forth of someone like him?” 
The monks then asked the Blessed One about it, and the Blessed One thought, “All those shortcomings ensue from the monks allowing the going forth of those without hands.”
{{milestone:{label:6.8,id:UT22084-001-001-2216}}}Then the Blessed One decreed, “Monks, in light of this, monks should not allow going forth, nor grant ordination, to those who are missing hands. A breach occurs if you allow their going forth and grant them ordination. Just as it is so for persons whose hands have been cut off, it is also so for persons missing a leg, persons with hands of webbed fingers, persons with no lips, persons whose bodies have been branded, scarred by a whip, or tattooed,{{note:{index200,id:UT22084-001-001-2217}}} or the very old. Monks, if you allow the going forth of those who are too young, they will spoil the saṅgha’s bedding with urine and feces.” The Blessed One decreed, “Their going forth should not be allowed either.” {{page:{number:260,id:UT22084-001-001-29300,folio:F.131.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:6.9,id:UT22084-001-001-2218}}}“The going forth of persons with mobility impairments is also being allowed,” the Blessed One said. “Neither should their going forth be allowed.”
“The going forth of loose women, persons missing an eye, persons whose hands have been cut off, persons with kyphosis, persons of restricted growth, persons with goiters, persons who are speech impaired, persons who are hearing impaired, persons who use mobility aids, and persons with elephantiasis are also being allowed,” the Blessed One said. “People such as they should not be allowed to go forth. If you allow them to go forth, a breach occurs.”
{{milestone:{label:6.10,id:UT22084-001-001-2220}}}“Monks, the going forth of those worn out by women, those worn out by burdens, those worn out by the road, persons with malabsorption syndromes, and persons with chronic fatigue are also being allowed,” the Blessed One said. “The going forth of such people should not be allowed. If you allow their going forth, a breach occurs.”
There are also other cases that warrant further exclusion.{{note:{index201,id:UT22084-001-001-2222}}}
