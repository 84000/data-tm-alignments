{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-002-section-1-1}}}Tīrthika
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-001-002-259}}}The Blessed Buddha was staying at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha when a great number of lay vow holders from Rājagṛha, who endeavored to see and pay their respects to the Blessed One every morning,{{note:{index:86,id:UT22084-001-002-260}}} thought, “The Blessed One has withdrawn into seclusion, as have the dedicated monks, so it is still too early for a visit to see and pay our respects to the Blessed One. Therefore, let us visit the park of another group of wandering mendicant tīrthikas.”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-001-002-261}}}With that, the great number of lay vow holders from Rājagṛha {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-001-002-1845,folio:F.131.b}}} set out for the park of another group of wandering mendicant tīrthikas. They were delighted to see the wandering mendicant tīrthikas together and, after various expressions of esteem, sat off to one side. One wandering mendicant then said to the other wandering mendicants, “Friends, are we the only ones with a seated practice, a protocol, and a restoration rite? Or do the ascetic sons of the Śākyan have them, too?”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-001-002-262}}}Another wandering mendicant replied, saying to the other wandering mendicants, “Friends, we alone have a seated practice, a protocol, and a restoration rite. The ascetic sons of the Śākyan do not have them.”
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-002-section-1-2}}}The Motion
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-001-002-264}}} The great number of lay vow holders from Rājagṛha neither praised what the other group of wandering mendicant tīrthikas had said nor did they repudiate it. Having neither praised nor repudiated it, they then rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. On reaching him, they bowed at his feet and sat off to one side. Having sat off to one side, these lay vow holders from Rājagṛha related at length everything that had happened while among the other group of wandering mendicant tīrthikas and then appealed to the Blessed One: “O Blessed One! Out of compassion, please establish a seated practice, a protocol, and a restoration rite of our own.” 
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-002-section-1-3}}}Consent
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-001-002-266}}}By remaining silent, the Blessed One consented to the appeal made by the great number of lay vow holders from Rājagṛha. Understanding the Blessed One’s silence to be consent, the great number of lay vow holders from Rājagṛha praised and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s proclamation before taking their leave from his presence. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-001-002-1846,folio:F.132.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-002-section-1-4}}}Seated Practice
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-001-002-268}}}The Blessed One then said to the monks, “I hereby declare that henceforth monks should attend to a seated practice, a protocol, and a restoration rite.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-001-002-269}}}Not knowing what a seated practice, a protocol, or a restoration rite ought to be, the monks appealed to the Blessed One, who replied, “Come, monks. The seated practice is called yoga.{{note:{index:87,id:UT22084-001-002-270}}} Reflect on this: no matter how you sit or what you do, the whole of this body, from the soles of the feet up to the hair on the crown and all the skin in between, is filled with all sorts of impurities—the hair on the head and face,{{note:{index:88,id:UT22084-001-002-271}}} the nails and teeth, the dirt, the grime, and the skin, flesh, bones, sinews, veins, kidneys, heart, spleen, lungs, intestines, colon, stomach, guts, bladder, liver, feces, tears, mucus, oils,{{note:{index:89,id:UT22084-001-002-272}}} lymph, marrow, fat, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, brains, meninges, and urine.”
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-002-section-1-5}}}Meditation Residence
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-001-002-274}}}After the Blessed One instructed them to engage in yoga, the monks engaged in yoga even when out on their rounds.{{note:{index:90,id:UT22084-001-002-275}}} And when they did, they collided with wandering elephants, horses, and infantrymen,{{note:{index:91,id:UT22084-001-002-276}}} causing them to trip and fall, prompting those who lacked faith to taunt those noble ones: “Didn’t you see them?”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-001-002-277}}}Told to engage in yoga, the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-001-002-1847,folio:F.132.b}}} “Those who are out on their rounds should not engage in yoga.”
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-001-002-278}}}When they engaged in yoga at the monastery gatehouse, they fell asleep, prompting those who lacked faith to taunt those noble ones: “Hey you! Is it your practice to sleep in public?”{{note:{index:92,id:UT22084-001-002-279}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-001-002-280}}}At this the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “You should not engage in yoga at the gatehouse.”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-001-002-281}}}When they engaged in yoga on the terrace{{note:{index:93,id:UT22084-001-002-282}}} and those same problems occurred, the Blessed One said, “You should not engage in yoga on the terrace.”
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-001-002-283}}}When they practiced in the residence hall,{{note:{index:94,id:UT22084-001-002-284}}} they failed to achieve single-pointed attention because noise is a thorn to concentration, so the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “You should not engage in yoga in the residence hall.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-001-002-285}}}When they went into the forest to practice, and bandits, rogues, lions, tigers, panthers,{{note:{index:95,id:UT22084-001-002-286}}} and leopards crossed their paths, the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “You should not engage in yoga in the forest.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-001-002-287}}}When they practiced on the outskirts of towns, those who lacked faith taunted those noble ones: “Hey you! Are you dead or what?”{{note:{index:96,id:UT22084-001-002-288}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-001-002-289}}}At this the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “You should surround a place with boughs, a lattice, or screens.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-001-002-290}}}So they surrounded a place with boughs, a lattice, and screens, but those who lacked faith taunted those noble ones: “What is this? A garden for melons and radishes?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-001-002-291}}}At this the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-001-002-1848,folio:F.133.a}}} “You should surround the place with walls or a ditch.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-001-002-292}}}So they surrounded the place with walls or ditches, but those who lacked faith taunted those noble ones: “What is this? A garden for lemons and pomegranates?” to which they replied, “We are practicing yoga.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-001-002-293}}}The monks then appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “I give consent to build a meditation residence.”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-001-002-294}}}Given consent by the Blessed One to build a meditation residence, but not knowing what a meditation residence ought to be like, the monks appealed to the Blessed One and the Blessed One replied, “There are two types of meditation residence: those in small clusters and those in large clusters. The smaller has two dwellings with a passageway in the middle while the larger has ten or twelve dwellings with a passageway in the middle.”{{note:{index:97,id:UT22084-001-002-295}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-001-002-297}}}When the monks built meditation residences, they built them like storerooms,{{note:{index:98,id:UT22084-001-002-2029}}} that is, without a doorway, so the Blessed One said, “A doorway should be cut out.”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-001-002-298}}}When the monks failed to install doors, the Blessed One said, “Doors should be installed.”
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-001-002-299}}}When the doors proved difficult to open, the Blessed One said, “Handles should be affixed to them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-001-002-300}}}When the rings of the door handles were found to make noise, the Blessed One said, “A piece of leather should be placed under them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-001-002-301}}}When the doors proved difficult to close, the Blessed One said, “A cross bolt, lever, or bar should be installed.”{{note:{index:99,id:UT22084-001-002-302}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-001-002-304}}}When the meditation residences proved dark, the Blessed One said, “A window should be cut out.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-001-002-305}}}When the windows were cut out too low, bandits, rogues, lions, tigers, and leopards{{note:{index:100,id:UT22084-001-002-306}}} got in, so the Blessed One said, “They should not be cut out too low.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-001-002-307}}}When the windows were cut out too high, the light was not bright enough, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-001-002-1849,folio:F.133.b}}} so the Blessed One said, “They should not be cut out too high. Leave two-thirds and cut them out of the remaining third.”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-001-002-308}}}When the monks left the upper two-thirds and cut out of the lower third, the Blessed One said, “Leave the lower two-thirds and cut the windows out of the remaining third above.”
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-001-002-309}}}When the monks cut out wide apertures that tapered in, the Blessed One said, “Windows should be shaped like the sea, with a narrow aperture and broad interior.”{{note:{index:101,id:UT22084-001-002-310}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-001-002-311}}}When crows, sparrows, and pigeons flew in, the Blessed One said, “The windows should be latticed.”
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-001-002-312}}} When house- and horseflies flew in, the Blessed One said, “The windows should have shutters.”{{note:{index:102,id:UT22084-001-002-313}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-001-002-314}}}When wind blew the shutters open, the Blessed One said, “A bar should be installed.”{{note:{index:103,id:UT22084-001-002-315}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-001-002-316}}}When the shutters proved difficult to close, the Blessed One said, “Cross bolts and levers should be installed.”{{note:{index:104,id:UT22084-001-002-317}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-001-002-318}}}When the shutters proved difficult to open, the Blessed One said, “Fashion a key lever{{note:{index:105,id:UT22084-001-002-319}}} from wood and use it to open the window, and a bar, a cross bolt, or a lever to close it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-001-002-321}}}Since seats were needed in the meditation residence, the Blessed One said, “Fashion a cushion of earth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-001-002-322}}}When these proved too hard, the Blessed One said, “Use a stool.”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-001-002-323}}}The Blessed One told the monks to use a stool, but they did not know what such a stool ought to be like, so the Blessed One said, “Make a stool with a frame one cubit long on each side and a woven seat for comfort.”{{note:{index:106,id:UT22084-001-002-324}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-001-002-325}}}Since the monks did not know what weave to use, the Blessed One said, “There are five weaves: sedge, hemp,{{note:{index:107,id:UT22084-001-002-326}}} vālvaja grass, paṭa straw, and reed.”{{note:{index:108,id:UT22084-001-002-327}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-001-002-328}}}When the monks found these too hard, the Blessed One said, {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-001-002-1850,folio:F.134.a}}} “Place a cushion over the seat.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-001-002-329}}}Since the monks did not know what a seat cushion ought to be like, the Blessed One said, “Sew together two pieces with a perimeter of four cubits, each side one cubit wide, and fill them with fibers.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-001-002-330}}}Since the monks did not know what fibers to use, the Blessed One said, “There are five types of fiber: arga fiber, kaśika fiber, erakā fiber, baka fiber, and śalmalī fiber.{{note:{index:109,id:UT22084-001-002-331}}} Alternatively, the cushion may be filled with one of the following five: wool, hemp, cotton, cloth shreds, or pāmṣu plant fibers.”
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-001-002-332}}}When the cushions were filled, all of the fibers shifted to one side, so the Blessed One said, “Using thread, partition it into pockets with crow’s feet seams.”{{note:{index:110,id:UT22084-001-002-333}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-001-002-335}}}When the monks fell asleep while seated, the Blessed One said, “A jar should be tied.” {{note:{index:111,id:UT22084-001-002-336}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-001-002-337}}}Since the monks did not know how to tie such a jar,{{note:{index:112,id:UT22084-001-002-338}}} the Blessed One said, “Tie it to the ear with string.”
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-001-002-339}}}When the monks still fell asleep, the Blessed One said, “Prod [the meditator] with a rod.”{{note:{index:113,id:UT22084-001-002-340}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-001-002-341}}}When the monks prodded them with a stylus-shaped rod, it left wounds, so the Blessed One said, “Use one shaped like a weighing pan.”{{note:{index:114,id:UT22084-001-002-342}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-001-002-343}}}When that still hurt the monks, the Blessed One said, “Once it has been wrapped in a piece of cloth, gently prod with it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-001-002-344}}}When the monks still fell asleep, the Blessed One said, “Throw a ball of yarn [at the meditator].”{{note:{index:115,id:UT22084-001-002-345}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-001-002-346}}}When the monks threw balls of yarn in the dark, they went astray, so the Blessed One said, “Attach it to a string and throw it. Then you may draw it back.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-001-002-347}}}When the monks still fell asleep, the Blessed One said, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-001-002-1851,folio:F.134.b}}} “Place a lamp in front.”{{note:{index:116,id:UT22084-001-002-348}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-001-002-349}}}When they still fell asleep, the Blessed One said, “Sit with one leg extended.”{{note:{index:117,id:UT22084-001-002-350}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-001-002-351}}}When they still fell asleep, the Blessed One said, “Sit with both legs extended.”{{note:{index:118,id:UT22084-001-002-352}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-001-002-353}}}When they still fell asleep, the Blessed One said, “Stand up and walk a bit.”
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-001-002-354}}}When the monks walked, they did so in a disorderly fashion so the Blessed One said, “Grab hold of the rope.”
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-001-002-355}}}When they followed the rope with their hands, the Blessed One said, “Punch a hole [in an object], affix it to the string, and hold on to that as you walk.”{{note:{index:119,id:UT22084-001-002-356}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-001-002-357}}}When they walked in sandals, they made noise, so the Blessed One said, “Do not walk in sandals.”
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-001-002-358}}}When their feet got dirty, the Blessed One said, “Lay down a mat.”{{note:{index:120,id:UT22084-001-002-359}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-001-002-360}}}When the mat became grimy, the Blessed One said, “Monks, I will establish the rules of customary conduct for meditators.{{note:{index:121,id:UT22084-001-002-361}}} Monk meditators should wash their feet every three days. Monk meditators should fully embrace the rules of customary conduct I have thus established. If they do not, they will commit a transgression.”
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-001-002-362}}}When the monks could no longer fit in the meditation residence, the Blessed One said, “Erect a second story above.”{{note:{index:122,id:UT22084-001-002-364}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.64,id:UT22084-001-002-365}}}When it proved difficult to climb up, the Blessed One said, “Build a staircase.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.65,id:UT22084-001-002-366}}}When the monks fell down, the Blessed One said, “Build a railing.”
{{milestone:{label:1.66,id:UT22084-001-002-367}}}When it proved shaky, the Blessed One said, “Fasten it down with iron nails.”
{{milestone:{label:1.67,id:UT22084-001-002-368}}}When the monks could still not fit in the meditation hall, the Blessed One said, “Erect a ring of dwellings around the meditation hall.”
{{milestone:{label:1.68,id:UT22084-001-002-369}}}When the monks cut out doorways, they could see one another, so the Blessed One said, “The doorways should be offset.{{note:{index:123,id:UT22084-001-002-370}}} Build a gatehouse.{{note:{index:124,id:UT22084-001-002-371}}} Build caves, too.”{{note:{index:125,id:UT22084-001-002-372}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.69,id:UT22084-001-002-373}}}When they fell asleep inside, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-001-002-1852,folio:F.135.a}}} the Blessed One said, “Hang a blanket or cloth near the door and sleep there. This need not be regretted.”{{note:{index:126,id:UT22084-001-002-374}}}
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-002-section-1-6}}}Manager
{{milestone:{label:1.70,id:UT22084-001-002-376}}}They then left, and on their return{{note:{index:127,id:UT22084-001-002-377}}} the Blessed One said, “A monk meditation manager should be appointed.{{note:{index:128,id:UT22084-001-002-378}}} For a monk manager, there are five factors that may pertain such that someone not already appointed should not be appointed, and if already appointed should be relieved of that position.
