{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-001-006-31}}}The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada. On that occasion some monks {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-001-006-7830,folio:F.278.a,volume:V1}}} caught an autumn disease. Because they had caught an autumn disease, they turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-001-006-32}}}The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why have these monks turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened?”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-001-006-33}}}The venerable Ānanda replied, “Honored One, these monks caught an autumn disease. Because they caught an autumn disease, they have turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened.”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-001-006-34}}}“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “on account of that, I authorize{{note:{index10,id:UT22084-001-006-35}}} monks to consume medicines.”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-001-006-36}}}When the Blessed One said “monks may consume medicines,” the monks consumed medicines at the appropriate time (morning){{note:{index11,id:UT22084-001-006-37}}} but did not consume them after the appropriate time, because they were monks who were in the habit of eating at the appropriate time. Therefore, the monks turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-001-006-38}}}The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, I said ‘monks may consume medicines.’ Why, then, have these monks turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened?”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-001-006-39}}}The venerable Ānanda replied, “The Blessed One said ‘monks may consume medicines,’ but they consumed medicines at the appropriate time and did not consume them after the appropriate time, because they are monks who are in the habit of eating at the appropriate time. Therefore, they turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened.” {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-001-006-7831,folio:F.278.b,volume:V1}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-001-006-40}}} “Ānanda, on account of that, I authorize monks to consume four kinds of medicines: medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time, medicines to be consumed at night, medicines to be consumed within seven days, and medicines to be consumed throughout life.{{note:{index12,id:UT22084-001-006-41}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-001-006-70}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-001-006-71}}}A monk had a wind illness and went to a physician. The monk said, “Sir, since I have a disease like this, prescribe medicine for me.” 
 “Noble one,” said the physician, “consume some fat and you will recover your health.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-001-006-73}}}The monk said, “Sir, what am I? A cannibal?” 
 “Monk, this is your medicine,” replied the physician. “You cannot recover your health with other medicines.”
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-001-006-75}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘Monk, this is your medicine. You cannot recover your health with other medicines,’ you should consume some fat.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-001-006-76}}}As the monks did not know what kind of fat they should consume, they asked the physician for advice. The physician said, “Noble ones, since your teacher is omniscient, go to him and ask.”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-001-006-77}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Five kinds of fats should be consumed. What are the five? They are fish fat, porpoise{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-001-006-78}}} fat, crocodile fat, bear fat, and pig fat. But these five kinds of fats should not be consumed if they have been boiled at an inappropriate time, strained at an inappropriate time, or given at an inappropriate time, or if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-001-006-7834,folio:F.280.a,volume:V1}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-001-006-79}}}“If the fats have been boiled at the appropriate time, but strained at an inappropriate time, and given at an inappropriate time, and if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time, they should not be consumed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-001-006-80}}}“If the fats have been boiled at the appropriate time and strained at the appropriate time, but given at an inappropriate time, and if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time, the fats should not be consumed.

{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-001-006-84}}}The monk then consumed the fat and his health returned. When his health returned, he threw away the remains of the fat. Later, another monk contracted the same disease, and he also went to the physician and said, “Sir, since I have a disease like this, prescribe medicine for me.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-001-006-85}}}The physician also prescribed fat for him. The second monk went to the first monk and said, “Venerable one, you consumed fat and the physician also prescribed fat for me. Are there any remains of the fat?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-001-006-86}}}“Indeed there were remains, but I threw them away,” replied the first monk.
The second monk told him, “It wasn’t good to do that.”
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-001-006-88}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks should not throw away the remains of fat but should keep them. I will now establish rules of customary behavior for a monk who keeps fat. A monk who keeps fat should give the remains of the fat to another monk. If the first monk does not give the remains to another monk, the first monk should put the remains in the infirmary. Anyone who needs fat should take it. If a monk who keeps the remains of fat does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-001-006-chapter-1-3}}}III. Scabies
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-001-006-89}}}The Blessed One was once dwelling in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-001-006-90}}}At that time, a monk had scabies. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-001-006-7835,folio:F.280.b,volume:V1}}} He went to a physician and said, “Sir, since I have scabies, prescribe medicine for me.” 
“Noble one,” said the physician, “use an astringent and you will recover your health.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-001-006-92}}}“Sir, what am I? One who is intoxicated with lust?”{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-001-006-93}}}
“Monk, this is your medicine,” replied the physician. “You cannot recover your health with other medicines.”
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-001-006-95}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘Monk, this is your medicine. You cannot recover your health with other medicines,’ you should use an astringent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-001-006-96}}}As the monks did not know what kind of astringent they should use, they asked the physician for advice. The physician said,{{note:{index25,id:UT22084-001-006-97}}} “Since your teacher is omniscient, he himself must know.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-001-006-98}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “There are five kinds of astringents: āmra astringent, . . . .”{{note:{index26,id:UT22084-001-006-99}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-001-006-100}}}When the monk kneaded the astringent and smeared it on his body, the rash spread. The Blessed One said, “You should make the astringent into a powder.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-001-006-101}}}When the monks ground the damp astringent into a powder, it became lumpy. The Blessed One said, “You should dry the astringent.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-001-006-102}}}When they dried the astringent in the sun, it lost its efficacy. The Blessed One said, “You should not dry the astringent in the sun.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-001-006-103}}}When they dried the astringent in the shade, it began to decompose. The Blessed One said, “You should dry the astringent in the shade where it is warm.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-001-006-104}}}The monk bathed after he smeared his body with the astringent, so the astringent did not work. The Blessed One said, “You should bathe after completely rubbing the astringent with your hands into your skin. If, after you bathe, you again smear the astringent and bathe, the astringent will work.”
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-001-006-105}}}When the monk smeared the astringent, the illness went away. He threw the remains of the astringent away. Later, another monk had the same disease, and he also went to the physician and said, “Sir, since I have a disease like this, prescribe medicine for me.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-001-006-106}}}The physician also prescribed an astringent for him. The second monk went to the first monk and said, “Venerable One, you used an astringent and the physician also prescribed an astringent for me. Are there any remains of the astringent?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-001-006-107}}}The first monk said,{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-001-006-108}}} “I threw them away.” 
The second monk told him, “It wasn’t good to do that.”
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-001-006-111}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-001-006-7836,folio:F.281.a,volume:V1}}} the Blessed One said, “I will now establish rules of customary behavior for a monk who keeps astringents. A monk who keeps astringents should give the remains of the astringent to another monk who needs them. If the first monk does not give the remains to another monk, he should put the remains of the astringent in the infirmary. If a monk who keeps astringents does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”

{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-001-006-112}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-001-006-113}}}A monk had an eye disease and went to a physician. The monk said, “Sir, since I have an eye disease, prescribe medicine for me.” 
“Noble one,” said the physician, “use collyrium and you will recover your health.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-001-006-115}}}“Sir, what am I? One who is intoxicated with lust?”{{note:{index28,id:UT22084-001-006-116}}}
“Monk, this is your medicine,” replied the physician. “You cannot recover your health with other medicines.”
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-001-006-118}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘Monk, this is your medicine. You cannot recover your health with other medicines,’ you should use collyrium.”
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-001-006-119}}}As the monks did not know what kind of collyrium to use, they asked the physician for advice. The physician said, “Since your teacher is omniscient, he himself must know.”{{note:{index29,id:UT22084-001-006-120}}} When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “There are five kinds of collyrium: collyrium derived from flowers, collyrium in a liquid state, collyrium in powder form, collyrium in pill form, and collyrium derived from red ocher.”{{note:{index30,id:UT22084-001-006-121}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-001-006-122}}}The monk recovered his health with the collyrium. Since he left the remains of the collyrium in many different places, the remains were lost. Later, another monk had an eye disease and also went to the physician, and the physician also prescribed the same collyrium for him. The second monk went to the first monk and said, “Venerable one, I also have an eye disease. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-001-006-7837,folio:F.281.b,volume:V1}}} Are there any remains of the collyrium?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-001-006-123}}}The first monk looked for the remains of the collyrium, but could not find them. He said, “Venerable one, indeed there were remains of the collyrium, but they have been lost because I left them in many different places.”
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-001-006-124}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks should not leave collyrium in many different places. I will now establish rules of customary behavior for a monk who keeps collyrium. A monk who keeps collyrium should store the collyrium according to its kind. He should keep collyrium derived from flowers in a vessel, collyrium in a liquid state in a bottle, and collyrium in powder form in a tubular vessel. He should put collyrium in pill form and collyrium derived from red ocher into bags, and he should bind and hang them on a peg in the wall. If a monk who keeps collyrium does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”{{note:{index31,id:UT22084-001-006-125}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-001-006-128}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-001-006-130}}}At that time, the venerable Saikata, his mind agitated, went mad and wandered about. Then some brahmins and householders saw him and said, “Sirs, whose son is this?” 
Others replied, “The householder So-and-so’s.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-001-006-131}}}The brahmins and householders said, “If the venerable Saikata had not gone forth among the masterless śramaṇas, who are the sons of the Śākyans, his kinsmen would have cured him.”
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-001-006-132}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, then cure the monk Saikata, asking a physician for advice.”
{{milestone:{label:1.64,id:UT22084-001-006-133}}}The monks went to a physician and said, “Sir, since a monk has a disease like this, prescribe medicine for him.” 
“Noble ones,” said the physician, “let him eat raw meat and he will recover his health.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.65,id:UT22084-001-006-135}}}“Sir, {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-001-006-7838,folio:F.282.a,volume:V1}}} what is he? A cannibal?”

{{milestone:{label:1.67,id:UT22084-001-006-138}}}The monks gave the venerable Saikata raw meat, but he could not eat the raw meat. The Blessed One said, “You should give him the meat after covering his eyes with a cloth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.68,id:UT22084-001-006-139}}}They gave the venerable Saikata raw meat and untied the cloth soon after giving him the raw meat. Then the venerable Saikata saw his hands soiled with raw meat and vomited in revulsion. The Blessed One said, “You should not untie the cloth that soon, but should untie it when you have placed a pure and fine meal before him and he has washed his hands.”
{{milestone:{label:1.69,id:UT22084-001-006-140}}}After the health of the venerable Saikata returned, he wanted to eat nothing but raw meat.

{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-001-006-200}}}The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once traveling through the country of Kāśi and arrived in Vārāṇasī. He stayed in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana near Vārāṇasī.
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-001-006-201}}}A householder named Mahāsena was living in Vārāṇasī. He was rich and had great wealth and many possessions. His wife’s name was Mahāsenā. Both he and his wife were pious and good and had virtuous dispositions. Mahāsena heard that the Buddha, the Blessed One, had arrived in Vārāṇasī, having traveled through the country of Kāśi, and that he was staying in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana near Vārāṇasī. When Mahāsena heard that, he thought, “Although the Blessed One has been invited to my house many times and has had meals, he has never been offered all the requisites. Now I will offer the Blessed One all the requisites for three months.” {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-001-006-7843,folio:F.284.b,volume:V1}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.4,id:UT22084-001-006-202}}}He went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side.{{note:{index39,id:UT22084-001-006-203}}} When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Mahāsena. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted him in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then the householder Mahāsena praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites for three months: namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.”
{{milestone:{label:2.5,id:UT22084-001-006-204}}}The Blessed One assented to the householder Mahāsena by remaining silent. The householder Mahāsena again praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. He bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, then rose from his seat and departed.
{{milestone:{label:2.6,id:UT22084-001-006-205}}}The Blessed One together with the community of monks was then provided by the householder Mahāsena with the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, for three months. The householder Mahāsena always rose at dawn, bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and visited the monks. There was a monk who was ill, seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness. {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-001-006-7844,folio:F.285.a,volume:V1}}} The physician told him, “Drink meat broth.” At that time, the householder Mahāsena went to that monk. When Mahāsena arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the monk, and he asked, “Noble one, what did the physician prescribe for you?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.7,id:UT22084-001-006-207}}}“The physician said to drink meat broth,” replied the sick monk.
Then the householder Mahāsena went to his own house and said to his wife, “Since the physician told Master So-and-so to drink meat broth, prepare it and give it to him.”
{{milestone:{label:2.8,id:UT22084-001-006-208}}}The householder Mahāsena’s wife handed money to a girl and sent her to the market. However, the king’s son was born on that day, and the following prohibition was proclaimed with the ringing of bells: “Nobody may kill beings. Whoever kills any living being will be severely punished.” Therefore, the girl could not get meat in the market even with the money.
{{milestone:{label:2.9,id:UT22084-001-006-209}}}When the girl reported this matter in detail to the householder Mahāsena, the householder Mahāsena’s wife thought, “Since we have offered the community of monks headed by the Buddha all the requisites, it would not be good if a monk dies because of a lack of medicine.” She took a sharp knife, entered the house, cut off some flesh from her thigh, handed it to the girl, and said, “Girl, make broth from this flesh and take it to the noble one So-and-so.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.10,id:UT22084-001-006-210}}}The girl took the broth to him, and the monk consumed the broth and recovered his health.  The monk knew that the householder’s wife had served him with her own flesh in that way and thought, “It is not appropriate for me to be lying down after consuming what was given with faith. Now I will exert myself in order to attain what I have not attained, realize what I have not realized, and actualize what I have not actualized.” He then became diligent.  Exerting himself, endeavoring and striving, he came to understand saṃsāra’s ever-revolving{{note:{index40,id:UT22084-001-006-211}}} five cycles; {{page:{number:17,id:UT22084-001-006-7845,folio:F.285.b,volume:V1}}} overthrew all conditioned states by nature subject to degradation, decline, dispersal, and destruction; abandoned all defilements; realized the state of an arhat; and became an arhat. He was free from desire for the three realms—one for whom a lump of dirt was equal to gold, for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand, who accepted being cut by an adze and being anointed with sandal paste as the same, and whose knowledge had shattered the eggshell of ignorance. He attained knowledge, supernormal knowledge, and discerning wisdom; he turned his back on worldly profit, desires, and honors; and he became an object of veneration, respect, and praise for the gods including Indra and Upendra. 
{{milestone:{label:2.11,id:UT22084-001-006-212}}}There is nothing, even in the slightest, that the buddhas, the blessed ones, do not know, see, comprehend, or understand. Early the next morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and, surrounded by a group of monks, went to the house of the householder Mahāsena, followed by the community of monks. When the Blessed One arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the householder Mahāsena, “Householder, the householder’s wife Mahāsenā is nowhere to be seen. Where is she?”

When, with his own hands, he had served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, and knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the householder took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Mahāsena. After having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Mahāsena in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed. 
{{milestone:{label:2.15,id:UT22084-001-006-218}}}Then the Blessed One went to the monastery and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, human flesh is the worst of all kinds of flesh. Therefore, monks should not eat human flesh. If a monk eats human flesh, he becomes guilty of a sthūlātyaya offense. I will now establish rules of customary behavior for an elder monk of the community. {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-001-006-7847,folio:F.286.b,volume:V1}}} If flesh is offered, an elder monk of the community should ask, ‘What flesh is this?’ If the elder monk of the community cannot, the second elder monk should ask.

{{milestone:{label:2.33,id:UT22084-001-006-246}}}The nāga of Campā was pious and good and had a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth days of every month, he left his abode, practiced the eightfold abstinence, illuminated the place, expanded his body, and gave it to others. He never harmed or frightened any beings in the world.
{{milestone:{label:2.34,id:UT22084-001-006-247}}}Since a famine had broken out, people who had lost their livelihoods, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people making a living properly, and people making a living improperly, started to cut off pieces of the nāga’s flesh and eat them.
{{milestone:{label:2.35,id:UT22084-001-006-248}}}Early in the morning the group of six monks dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and entered the town for alms. When they entered a house where a householder was cooking nāga flesh in a pot, the householder’s wife said, “Noble ones, we have nothing to offer you. Please leave.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.36,id:UT22084-001-006-249}}}“Is there something cooking in this pot?” asked the monks.
“Noble ones, this is nāga flesh. Do you eat nāga flesh?” 
“Our lives {{page:{number:23,id:UT22084-001-006-7851,folio:F.288.b,volume:V1}}} depend on you. If you eat it, please give it to us, too.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.37,id:UT22084-001-006-252}}}She then offered the nāga flesh to them. Most of the other people then started to eat nāga flesh too, thinking, “Even the noble ones eat it.” At that time, the wife of the nāga of Campā thought, “Because even these noble ones eat nāga flesh, most people now eat it too. How long does my husband have to bear his pain? I will ask the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:2.38,id:UT22084-001-006-253}}}Then the wife of the nāga of Campā, after the first watch of that night,{{note:{index43,id:UT22084-001-006-254}}} went to the Blessed One, showing her noble figure. When she arrived, she bowed down until her forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then she sat down to one side. At that time, the figure of the wife of the nāga of Campā radiated light, the vast splendor of which filled the entire neighborhood of Ṛṣi Gargā Pond. After she sat down, the wife of the nāga of Campā said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, my husband is pious and good and has a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth days of every month, he leaves his abode, practices the eightfold abstinence, and gives his body to others. He never harms or frightens any beings in the world. Since a famine has broken out, people who have lost their livelihoods, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people making a living properly, and people making a living improperly, cut off pieces of the nāga’s flesh and eat them. The noble ones saw this and they too started to eat the flesh. Because the noble ones eat it, most people have also started to cut it off and eat it. How long does my husband have to bear his pain? Alas, Blessed One, please have compassion and devise some reason for the noble ones to resolve not to eat nāga flesh.” {{page:{number:24,id:UT22084-001-006-7852,folio:F.289.a,volume:V1}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.39,id:UT22084-001-006-255}}}The Blessed One assented to the wife of the nāga of Campā by remaining silent. The wife of the nāga of Campā, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed down until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet and then disappeared from that very place. Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, last night the wife of the nāga of Campā came to me after the first watch of the night, showing her noble figure. When she arrived, she bowed down until her forehead touched my feet, and then she sat down to one side. At that time, the figure of the wife of the nāga of Campā radiated light, the vast splendor of which filled the entire neighborhood of Ṛṣi Gargā Pond. After she had sat down, the wife of the Nāga of Campā said to me, ‘Honored One, my husband is pious and good and has a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth days of every month, he leaves his abode, practices the eightfold abstinence, and gives his body to others. He never harms or frightens any beings in the world. Since a famine has broken out, people who have lost their livelihoods, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people making a living properly, and people making a living improperly, cut off pieces of the nāga’s flesh and eat them. When they began to eat the flesh, the noble ones also started to eat it. Because the noble ones also eat the flesh, most people have also started to cut it off and eat it too. How long does my husband have to bear his pain? Alas, Blessed One, please have compassion and devise some reason for the noble ones to resolve not to eat nāga flesh.’ {{page:{number:25,id:UT22084-001-006-7853,folio:F.289.b,volume:V1}}} I assented to the wife of the nāga of Campā by remaining silent, and the wife of the nāga of Campā, knowing that I had assented by remaining silent, bowed down until her forehead touched my feet and then disappeared from that very place. Now the gods also criticize, insult, and disparage the monks who ate the nāga flesh, saying, ‘Those monks, the sons of the Śākyans, have fallen away from the virtuous dharmas.’ This incident is not good, not appropriate. Therefore, monks, monks should not eat nāga flesh. If a monk eats nāga flesh, he becomes guilty of an offense.”

{{milestone:{label:2.40,id:UT22084-001-006-256}}}The Blessed One was once traveling through the country of Magadha and arrived at Rājagṛha. He stayed in Kalandaka­nivāpa{{note:{index44,id:UT22084-001-006-257}}} Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha.
{{milestone:{label:2.41,id:UT22084-001-006-258}}}When King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard that the Buddha, the Blessed One, was traveling through the country of Magadha, had arrived at Rājagṛha, and was staying in Kalandaka­nivāpa Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha, he thought, “Although I have invited the Blessed One many times and the Blessed One has had meals, he has never been offered all the requisites for three months. Now I will offer the Blessed One all the requisites for three months, and I will also send Jīvaka, the chief physician.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.42,id:UT22084-001-006-259}}}The king went to the Blessed One displaying royal treasures and great royal power. When the king arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha. {{page:{number:26,id:UT22084-001-006-7854,folio:F.290.a,volume:V1}}} After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the king in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, along with Jīvaka, the chief physician, for three months.”
{{milestone:{label:2.43,id:UT22084-001-006-260}}}The Blessed One assented to King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha by remaining silent. King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed. The Blessed One together with the community of monks was provided by King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha with all the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, along with Jīvaka, the chief physician, for three months.
{{milestone:{label:2.44,id:UT22084-001-006-261}}}When King Prasenajit of Kosala heard that the Blessed One together with the community of disciples had been provided by King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha with all the requisites, along with Jīvaka, the chief physician, for three months, he thought, “He is an anointed kṣatriya king, and I am also an anointed kṣatriya king. His chief physician is Jīvaka, and my chief physician is Ātreya.{{note:{index45,id:UT22084-001-006-262}}}{{page:{number:27,id:UT22084-001-006-7855,folio:F.290.b,volume:V1}}} So, I will offer the Blessed One together with the community of disciples all the requisites, along with Ātreya, the chief physician, when the Blessed One comes to Śrāvastī.”
{{milestone:{label:2.45,id:UT22084-001-006-263}}}The Blessed One stayed at Rājagṛha during the rainy season. When the three months of the rainy season had passed, he finished mending his robes, took his bowl and his robe, and traveled through the country toward Śrāvastī, surrounded by a group of monks and followed by the community of monks. In due course, the Blessed One, traveling through the country, arrived in Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:2.46,id:UT22084-001-006-264}}}When King Prasenajit of Kosala heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, had arrived in Śrāvastī and was staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī, he left Śrāvastī and went to the Blessed One. When the king arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Prasenajit of Kosala. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted him in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, {{page:{number:28,id:UT22084-001-006-7856,folio:F.291.a,volume:V1}}} “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, along with Ātreya, the chief physician, for three months.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.47,id:UT22084-001-006-265}}}The Blessed One assented to King Prasenajit of Kosala by remaining silent. King Prasenajit of Kosala, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed. The Blessed One together with the community of monks was provided by King Prasenajit of Kosala with all the requisites, along with Ātreya, the chief physician, for three months.
{{milestone:{label:2.48,id:UT22084-001-006-266}}}King Prasenajit of Kosala always rose at dawn, bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and visited the sick monks. 
{{milestone:{label:2.49,id:UT22084-001-006-267}}}At that time, a monk had hemorrhoids and turned pale, became emaciated, lost his strength, and was weakened. King Prasenajit of Kosala saw him and asked, “Noble one, why have you turned pale, become emaciated, lost your strength, and been weakened?”
“Your Majesty, I have hemorrhoids,” answered the monk.
{{milestone:{label:2.50,id:UT22084-001-006-269}}}The king then ordered Ātreya, the chief physician, “Treat this monk.” 
“Certainly, Your Majesty,” Ātreya replied.
{{milestone:{label:2.51,id:UT22084-001-006-271}}}Because Ātreya was impious, he did not treat the monk. Later, the king saw the monk again and asked him, “Noble one, were you not treated by Ātreya?” 
“I was not, Your Majesty,” answered the monk.
{{milestone:{label:2.52,id:UT22084-001-006-273}}}Then the king became enraged. He summoned Ātreya by messenger and warned, “If you treat this monk, all will be fine. But if you do not, I will curtail your allotment.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.53,id:UT22084-001-006-274}}}Ātreya, who was naturally impious, himself became very angry and thought, {{page:{number:29,id:UT22084-001-006-7857,folio:F.291.b,volume:V1}}} “His Majesty will curtail my allotment because of this shaven-headed śramaṇa.” Ātreya tied the monk up at the gate of the Jetavana and began surgery. The monk, growing afraid, fearful, and hurt, and experiencing acute, intolerable, and unpleasant pain, wondered to himself, “Does the Blessed One not observe me afraid, fearful, and hurt?”
{{milestone:{label:2.54,id:UT22084-001-006-275}}}There is nothing, even in the slightest, that the buddhas, the blessed ones, do not know, see, comprehend, or understand. When the Blessed One, spurred by great compassion, went there, Ātreya, the chief physician, saw the Blessed One arrive. Upon seeing him, Ātreya, fiercely angry, called out to the Blessed One, “Come here, śramaṇa, son of a slave woman—look at your disciple’s anus cut open!”
{{milestone:{label:2.55,id:UT22084-001-006-276}}}Then the Blessed One left, returned to the monastery, and sat on the seat prepared for him. When he had sat down, the Blessed One smiled.{{note:{index46,id:UT22084-001-006-277}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.56,id:UT22084-001-006-278}}} It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile, rays of blue, yellow, red, and white light emanate from their mouths. Some of the rays stream downward and some stream upward. 
{{milestone:{label:2.57,id:UT22084-001-006-279}}}Those rays that stream downward go to the hells of Reviving, Black Cord, Being Crushed, Scream, Great Scream, Heat, Intense Heat, Incessant, Blisters, Burst Blisters, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Water Lily, Lotus, and Great Lotus. They alight on and cool those in the hot hells and alight on and warm those in the cold hells. {{page:{number:30,id:UT22084-001-006-7858,folio:F.292.a,volume:V1}}} Thus, each of the various pains of those beings in hell ceases. When those beings think, “Sirs, have we died here and been reborn elsewhere?” the blessed ones send an emanation to engender their faith. Seeing it, they think, “Sirs, we have not died here and been reborn elsewhere. Each of our various pains ceased on account of the power of this being we have never seen before.” Their minds filled with faith in the emanation, they exhaust the karma that led them to experience the hells and are reborn among gods and humans as vessels for seeing the truths.
{{milestone:{label:2.58,id:UT22084-001-006-280}}}Those rays that stream upward go to the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-Three Gods, the gods of Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin, the gods attendant on Brahmā, and the gods of Brahma­purohita, Mahābrahman, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, Ābhāsvara, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, Śubhakṛtsna, Anabhraka, Puṇyaprasava, Bṛhatphala, Abṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha. They resonate with the words “impermanent,” “subject to suffering,” “empty,” and “selfless,” and they proclaim these two verses:
{{milestone:{label:2.59,id:UT22084-001-006-281}}}“Take action! Go forth! 
Apply yourself to the Buddha’s teachings!
As an elephant destroys a house made of reeds, 
Destroy the army of Death!
{{milestone:{label:2.60,id:UT22084-001-006-282}}}“Those who, with great care, 
Exert themselves in this Dharma and Vinaya
Abandon the course of rebirth
And bring an end to suffering!”{{note:{index47,id:UT22084-001-006-283}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.61,id:UT22084-001-006-284}}}Then the rays of light, {{page:{number:31,id:UT22084-001-006-7859,folio:F.292.b,volume:V1}}} after unfurling through the worlds of the great billionfold universe, later return to the Blessed One. The rays disappear into the space behind the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain actions of the past. They disappear into the space in front of the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain the future. They disappear into the soles of his feet when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth in the hells. They disappear into his heels when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as an animal. They disappear into his big toe when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a hungry ghost. They disappear into his knees when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a human. They disappear into his left palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king of power.{{note:{index48,id:UT22084-001-006-285}}} They disappear into his right palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king. They disappear into his navel when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a god. They disappear into his mouth when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a disciple. They disappear into the circle of hair between his eyebrows when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a self-awakened one. They disappear into the crown of his head when the Blessed One intends to explain complete and perfect awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:2.62,id:UT22084-001-006-286}}}The rays of light then circled the Blessed One three times and disappeared into the soles of his feet.{{note:{index49,id:UT22084-001-006-287}}}The venerable Ānanda made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said: 
{{milestone:{label:2.63,id:UT22084-001-006-9446}}}“A mass made brilliant by thousands of colors
Came forth from your mouth,
Like the sun rising, 
Shining in every direction.”
{{milestone:{label:2.64,id:UT22084-001-006-289}}}And Ānanda then spoke these verses:
“One who has become a buddha, the supreme cause in the world, 
Free from restlessness, discouragement, and self-satisfaction, 
A victor who has subdued enemies—
Not without cause does he flash a smile, 
White like a lotus root or a conch shell.
{{milestone:{label:2.65,id:UT22084-001-006-291}}}“Therefore, O resolute one, please know when the time is right, {{page:{number:32,id:UT22084-001-006-7860,folio:F.293.a,volume:V1}}}
O lord of victors, supreme Muni, 
And resolve the doubts of your listeners who desire to hear 
With words that are reliable, sublime, and excellent.
{{milestone:{label:2.66,id:UT22084-001-006-292}}}“Protectors, perfectly awakened ones, 
Who are steady like the mountains in the middle of the ocean, 
Do not smile accidentally.
These many people desire to hear 
For what reason the resolute one smiles.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.67,id:UT22084-001-006-293}}}“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “that is exactly it! Tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause or condition. Ānanda, Ātreya, the chief physician, is degenerate and will meet an untimely end. He said ‘son of a slave woman’ to the Tathāgata, who has had no fault in his conduct since he assumed Mahāsammata’s lineage. In seven days Ātreya will die, vomiting blood. With the destruction of his body, he will be reborn among the hell beings. Therefore, monks, you should not treat Ātreya or others like Ātreya with respect. You should not surgically remove hemorrhoids. Treatment for hemorrhoids should be done in two ways: mantras{{note:{index50,id:UT22084-001-006-294}}} and medicines. If a monk surgically removes hemorrhoids or treats Ātreya or others like Ātreya with respect, the monk becomes guilty of an offense.”
{{milestone:{label:2.68,id:UT22084-001-006-295}}}The monk died from the particular harm done by Ātreya. The ministers reported to King Prasenajit, “Your Majesty, Ātreya said ‘son of a slave woman’ to the Blessed One and that monk died of the particular harm done by Ātreya.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.69,id:UT22084-001-006-296}}}The king was then very much enraged and shouted to his ministers, “Sirs, I have renounced Ātreya, the chief physician. {{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-001-006-7861,folio:F.293.b,volume:V1}}} Go!”{{note:{index51,id:UT22084-001-006-297}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.70,id:UT22084-001-006-298}}}“Your Majesty,” said the ministers, “why would you want to kill he who is already dead? The Blessed One predicted, ‘In seven days he will die, vomiting blood. With the destruction of his body, he will be reborn among the hell beings.’ ” 
“Then banish him from my country,” ordered the king.
{{milestone:{label:2.71,id:UT22084-001-006-300}}}The ministers banished Ātreya and he went to a country called Sāketā. The gods living in Sāketā greatly reviled him: “You stupid man, why should you who has said ‘son of a slave woman’ to the protector of the three realms stay here?” And so they expelled Ātreya. Then he went to Vārāṇasī. Then, having been expelled from there, he went to Vaiśālī. Then, having been expelled from there, he went to Campā. Then, having been expelled from there, he went to Rājagṛha. Then, having been expelled from there, he dwelt under a tree. Then, having been expelled from there by the gods living in the tree, Ātreya went to the shores of a river, a lake, and a pond. Even there he could not find an opportunity to stay and thought, “Although even foxes find opportunities to stay on this continent of Jambu, I have nowhere to stay even under a tree, at a lake, or at a pond.” Then, the fierce agony arose for him in which one dies vomiting blood. As soon as he died, he was reborn in the great hell of Incessant.
{{milestone:{label:2.72,id:UT22084-001-006-301}}}Then the Blessed One spoke these verses about that incident:
“Words, like an axe, hurtle forth from the mouth 
Of a person who has been reborn.
Those who speak ill
Cut themselves with the words they say.
{{milestone:{label:2.73,id:UT22084-001-006-303}}}“Those who praise those who are worthy of reproach

{{milestone:{label:2.76,id:UT22084-001-006-309}}}The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once traveling through the country of Kāśi and stayed overnight in a town where the boundary had not been fixed. There the Blessed One caught a wind illness. The venerable Ānanda thought, “Although I have attended to the Blessed One at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a physician for advice. Now I will ask a physician for advice.” He went to a physician and said, “Sir, since the Blessed One has a disease like this, prescribe medicine for him.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.77,id:UT22084-001-006-310}}}“Noble one,” said the physician, “have him eat the three spices{{note:{index55,id:UT22084-001-006-311}}} boiled with a good amount of ghee,{{note:{index56,id:UT22084-001-006-312}}} and he will recover his health.” 
Then the venerable Ānanda himself prepared and cooked the food and offered it to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:2.78,id:UT22084-001-006-314}}}The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, what is this?” 
Ānanda said, “Honored One, I thought, ‘Although I have attended to the Blessed One at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a physician for advice. Now I will ask a physician for advice.’ When I consulted a physician, he said, ‘Noble one, have him eat the three spices boiled with a good amount of ghee, and he will recover his health.’ So I myself prepared and cooked it.”
{{milestone:{label:2.79,id:UT22084-001-006-316}}}“Ānanda, where did you make it?”
“Within the boundary.”{{note:{index57,id:UT22084-001-006-318}}}

“Within the boundary.”
{{milestone:{label:2.81,id:UT22084-001-006-322}}}“Who cooked it?”
“I did, {{page:{number:35,id:UT22084-001-006-7863,folio:F.294.b,volume:V1}}} within the boundary.”
{{milestone:{label:2.82,id:UT22084-001-006-324}}}“Ānanda, what was cooked within the boundary and was left within the boundary should not be eaten. What was cooked within the boundary and was left outside the boundary should not be eaten. What was cooked outside the boundary and was left within the boundary should not be eaten. What was cooked outside the boundary and was left outside the boundary may be eaten. Ānanda, what was cooked by a monk, whether within the boundary or outside the boundary, should not be eaten in any situation.”
The Blessed One concluded, “What was cooked by a monk should not be eaten in any situation.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.83,id:UT22084-001-006-326}}}A householder living in Śrāvastī went to the Blessed One. When the householder arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder. After he had . . . delighted him in a variety of ways . . . the Blessed One remained silent.  Then the householder rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” . . . Then the householder let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.84,id:UT22084-001-006-327}}}Early in the morning the community of monks dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-001-006-7864,folio:F.295.a,volume:V1}}} went to the house of the householder. The Blessed One refrained from going for almsfood. 
{{milestone:{label:2.85,id:UT22084-001-006-328}}}The buddhas, the blessed ones, refrain from going for almsfood for five reasons. What are the five? Wishing to look after the sick, wishing to look after the living quarters, wishing to go into seclusion, wishing to teach the Dharma to the gods, and wishing to establish a rule of training in the Vinaya for the disciples. In this case, the Blessed One refrained from going for almsfood because he wished to establish a rule of training in the Vinaya for the disciples.
{{milestone:{label:2.86,id:UT22084-001-006-329}}}The venerable Ānanda was in charge of receiving almsfood for the Blessed One. He was there given boiled rice, which was not fully cooked, and he thought, “It has not been long since the Blessed One recovered, and this rice is not fully cooked. So, if he has this rice, his illness may return. Although the Blessed One has not authorized cooking such food, it is probable that this situation will lead him to authorize cooking it.” Ānanda took a pitcher, poured water into the boiled rice, and cooked it until it was done. Then he offered the boiled rice to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:2.87,id:UT22084-001-006-330}}}The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, does the entire community have the same boiled rice as this?”
“No, they do not, Honored One. Theirs is not fully cooked.”
{{milestone:{label:2.88,id:UT22084-001-006-332}}}“Then where did it come from?”
When Ānanda related to the Blessed One in detail what had happened, the Blessed One said, “Good, good, Ānanda! {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-001-006-7865,folio:F.295.b,volume:V1}}} You know even what I have not authorized. On account of that, I authorize monks to receive boiled rice that is not fully cooked and to cook and eat it.”
{{milestone:{label:2.89,id:UT22084-001-006-334}}}After the Blessed One said “monks may receive boiled rice that is not fully cooked and cook and eat it,” the group of six monks received raw rice{{note:{index59,id:UT22084-001-006-335}}} and began to cook and eat it. 
{{milestone:{label:2.90,id:UT22084-001-006-336}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You may receive, cook, and eat boiled rice, one third of which is cooked. You may receive and eat vegetables, flowers, fruits, fish, and meat after their color changes. You may receive, boil, and drink liquids such as milk when they have been boiled two or three times. You should not have any regrets about consuming such things. If you consume them in other ways, you become guilty of an offense.”

{{milestone:{label:2.91,id:UT22084-001-006-339}}}The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada. 
{{milestone:{label:2.92,id:UT22084-001-006-9447}}}At that time a householder named Bhava was living in a city called Sūrpāraka. He was rich and had great wealth and many possessions, with holdings both vast and extensive. He possessed wealth equal to that of Vaiśravaṇa, rivaling that of Vaiśravaṇa. Bhava took a wife from a family of equal rank, and Bhava and his wife played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, and thus the wife conceived a child. After eight or nine months, a boy who was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold was born. At the birth, the householder held a great celebration for twenty-one days and, to give the baby a name, he asked, “What name shall we give this boy?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.93,id:UT22084-001-006-341}}}His kinsmen {{page:{number:38,id:UT22084-001-006-7866,folio:F.296.a,volume:V1}}} suggested, “Since this boy is the son of the householder Bhava, let us name him Bhavila.” Thus the boy was named Bhavila.
{{milestone:{label:2.94,id:UT22084-001-006-342}}}Then the couple again played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, and another boy was born and named Bhavatrāta.
And then again a boy was born to the householder and was named Bhavanandin.
{{milestone:{label:2.95,id:UT22084-001-006-344}}}Later, the householder Bhava caught an illness and spoke very harsh words, and thus his wife and sons abandoned him. He had a servant girl, and she thought, “Although my master won possessions through hundreds of thousands of means, he now has an illness and was abandoned even by his wife and sons. If I{{note:{index61,id:UT22084-001-006-345}}} give up on my master, that would not be appropriate for me.”
{{milestone:{label:2.96,id:UT22084-001-006-346}}}She went to a physician and asked, “Master, do you know the householder Bhava?”
“Yes, I do. What happened to him?”
{{milestone:{label:2.97,id:UT22084-001-006-348}}}“He has such-and-such kind of illness, and he was abandoned by his wife and sons. Prescribe medicine for him.”
{{milestone:{label:2.98,id:UT22084-001-006-350}}}“You said he was abandoned by his wife and sons. Then who attends to him?” asked the physician.
{{milestone:{label:2.99,id:UT22084-001-006-351}}}“I attend to him. Please prescribe inexpensive medicine.”
The physician prescribed it, saying, “This is his medicine.”
{{milestone:{label:2.100,id:UT22084-001-006-352}}}Then the servant girl, taking some food for Bhava from her own provisions and also taking some from the house, attended to him, and he recovered his health. Bhava thought, “I was abandoned by my wife and sons and I owe my life to this girl. I should do something for her in return.” Bhava said to her, “Girl, I was abandoned by my wife and sons and I owe my life to you. So I will give you whatever you most want. Tell me what you want.”
{{milestone:{label:2.101,id:UT22084-001-006-353}}}“Master, {{page:{number:39,id:UT22084-001-006-7867,folio:F.296.b,volume:V1}}} if you are satisfied with me, I would like to have sex with you.” 
Bhava said, “What is the use of our having sex? I will give you five hundred kārṣāpaṇas and liberate you from servitude.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.102,id:UT22084-001-006-355}}}“Master, I am nothing but a slave whether I am far from here or in the next life,” she replied. “If I have sex with you, Master, I am not a slave.”{{note:{index62,id:UT22084-001-006-356}}}
Bhava, knowing she would insist, said, “Girl, tell me when the time is right and you are fertile.”{{note:{index63,id:UT22084-001-006-358}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.103,id:UT22084-001-006-359}}}Later, when the time was right and she was fertile, she told him. Then the two, the householder Bhava and the servant girl, enjoyed themselves together, and she conceived a child. From the very day the child was conceived, all the wealth and all the business of the householder Bhava became abundant and fulfilled. After eight or nine months, a boy was born. He was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold, with a golden complexion, his head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and every major limb and minor appendage of his body complete. From the time he was born, all the wealth and all the business of the householder Bhava again became abundant and fulfilled. At the birth, the householder held a great celebration for twenty-one days and, to give the baby a name, . . . “Let us name him Pūrṇa (Fulfilled).” Thus the boy was named Pūrṇa.
{{milestone:{label:2.104,id:UT22084-001-006-360}}} The boy Pūrṇa was entrusted to eight nursemaids: two nursemaids to change his diapers . . . (The passage should be recited in detail, up to:){{note:{index64,id:UT22084-001-006-361}}} He grew quickly like a lotus shooting up in a pond.  When Pūrṇa grew up, he was taught letters, calculation, numbers, counting by hand, {{page:{number:40,id:UT22084-001-006-7868,folio:F.297.a,volume:V1}}} and how to deal with loans and two different types of deposits,{{note:{index65,id:UT22084-001-006-362}}} and he became fully learned in eight kinds of analysis: the analysis of land, the analysis of cloth, the analysis of jewels, the analysis of wood, the analysis of elephants, the analysis of horses, the analysis of boys, and the analysis of girls. He also mastered other kinds of analysis and reading, and became one whose actions are clear. 
{{milestone:{label:2.105,id:UT22084-001-006-363}}}Later, the householder Bhava made his sons get married one by one, beginning with Bhavila.{{note:{index66,id:UT22084-001-006-364}}} The sons were so attached to their own wives that they abandoned the family business and settled down, smitten with physical beauty alone. Therefore, the householder Bhava was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand. His sons noticed him and asked, “Father, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.106,id:UT22084-001-006-365}}}“Sons,” he replied, “I did not get married until I had a hundred thousand pieces of gold. You have abandoned the family business and settled down, smitten with physical beauty alone. After my death, my family will be full of misery. How could I not be plunged into grief?”
{{milestone:{label:2.107,id:UT22084-001-006-366}}}Bhavila, taking off his jeweled earrings and putting on wooden earrings (dārukarṇikā), promised, “I will not put on jeweled earrings until I acquire a hundred thousand pieces of gold.”
{{milestone:{label:2.108,id:UT22084-001-006-367}}}The next one, putting on lac{{note:{index67,id:UT22084-001-006-368}}} earrings (stavakarṇikā), made the same promise.
Then the third one, putting on lead earrings (trapukarṇikā), made the same promise too.
{{milestone:{label:2.109,id:UT22084-001-006-370}}}Although they had been known by the names Bhavila, Bhavatrāta, and Bhavanandin, those names disappeared, and they came to be known by the names Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin. 
{{milestone:{label:2.110,id:UT22084-001-006-371}}}When the three sons took to the great ocean carrying merchandise, Pūrṇa said, “Father, I will take to the great ocean, too.” 
His father replied, “Son, {{page:{number:41,id:UT22084-001-006-7869,folio:F.297.b,volume:V1}}} because you are a child, you should stay here and do what needs to be done in the store.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.111,id:UT22084-001-006-373}}}And so Pūrṇa stayed. His elder brothers returned, having been successful on their voyage. After they were fully rested, they said, “Father, please calculate the value of our merchandise.” Their father calculated the value and found that each of the three sons had acquired a hundred thousand pieces of gold. 
{{milestone:{label:2.112,id:UT22084-001-006-374}}}Pūrṇa had also lawfully earned more than a hundred thousand pieces of gold. He threw himself at his father’s feet and said, “Father, please calculate the money I earned at the store, too.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.113,id:UT22084-001-006-375}}}“Son, you have remained here,” replied his father. “What is there to calculate for you?” 
“Father, at any rate, please calculate it and you will understand,” said Pūrṇa. 
{{milestone:{label:2.114,id:UT22084-001-006-377}}}His father calculated it and found that there were, except for the capital, more than a hundred thousand pieces of gold obtained properly. The householder Bhava, being pleased and delighted, thought, “This creature appears to be one who has the great power of merit. Just remaining here, he has acquired a hundred thousand pieces of gold.”
{{milestone:{label:2.115,id:UT22084-001-006-378}}}Later, the householder Bhava caught an illness. He thought, “After my death, my sons will go their separate ways. So I must devise a plan to keep them together.” He said to them, “Sons, prepare firewood.” When the sons had prepared firewood, he said, “Kindle a fire.” When the sons had kindled a fire, he said, “Pull out, one by one, the pieces of wood.” When the sons had pulled out, one by one, the pieces of wood, the fire was extinguished. He asked, “Sons, did you see that?” 
“We did, father,” said his sons.
{{milestone:{label:2.116,id:UT22084-001-006-380}}}Bhava then recited a verse:
“Fire burns when pieces of wood are gathered together.
Brothers together are just the same.
If you separate the pieces of wood, the fire is extinguished.
People are just like that.”
{{milestone:{label:2.117,id:UT22084-001-006-382}}}“Sons, after my death, {{page:{number:42,id:UT22084-001-006-7870,folio:F.298.a,volume:V1}}} you should not listen to the words of women.
“Families are divided because of women.
Those who are clever are divided by words.
Mantras increase{{note:{index68,id:UT22084-001-006-384}}} when they are badly chanted.
Friends are divided because of desire.”
{{milestone:{label:2.118,id:UT22084-001-006-385}}}The sons, except for Bhavila, went elsewhere. Bhavila stayed and his father said to him, “Son, whatever happens, you should not abandon Pūrṇa. He has the great power of merit.” Then Bhava passed away, saying:
{{milestone:{label:2.119,id:UT22084-001-006-386}}}“All accumulation ends in loss;
What is lofty in the end will fall;
All meetings end in separation;
All life ends in death.”{{note:{index69,id:UT22084-001-006-387}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.120,id:UT22084-001-006-388}}}The sons decorated his bier with blue, yellow, red, and white cloth, performed a great ceremony, carried the body to the charnel ground, and cremated it. Then, having assuaged their grief, they said to one another, “When our father was alive, we depended on him for our livelihoods. But now he is dead. If we now{{note:{index70,id:UT22084-001-006-389}}} abandon the family business and settle down, the family will dissolve and we will be reproached by our kinsmen. So let us go abroad carrying merchandise.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.121,id:UT22084-001-006-390}}}Pūrṇa said, “Then I will go, too.” 
“You should stay here and do what needs to be done in the store,” said the brothers. “Only we three will go.” The three brothers then went abroad carrying merchandise. Pūrṇa, entrusted with all the other responsibilities, stayed behind. 
{{milestone:{label:2.122,id:UT22084-001-006-392}}}It is commonplace that in a wealthy family each member of the family is given money for everyday expenses. The wives of the three elder brothers sent their female slaves to Pūrṇa to receive the money for everyday expenses. But since Pūrṇa was surrounded by merchants, {{page:{number:43,id:UT22084-001-006-7871,folio:F.298.b,volume:V1}}} businessmen, caravan leaders, and servants, the female slaves did not find an opportunity to receive the money for everyday expenses. After the guests had stood up and left, the female slaves were then given the money for that day. When the female slaves returned late, they were scolded: “Hey, girl, why are you so late?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.123,id:UT22084-001-006-393}}}“Pūrṇa was surrounded by merchants, businessmen, caravan leaders, and servants, and his brightness was blazing like the light of the sun,” they replied. “When everyone else had stood up and left, we were given the money.” 
“Such a thing occurs when sons of slave women come into power in someone’s house,” remarked the wives.
{{milestone:{label:2.124,id:UT22084-001-006-395}}}The wife of Bhavila asked her female slave, “Why are you so late?” 
When the female slave had explained the matter in detail, the wife of Bhavila said, “Thank you. You should go when you know the time is right.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.125,id:UT22084-001-006-397}}}Because the female slave knew when the time was right and went then, she quickly received the money. The other female slaves took a long time. They asked the first one, “How did you come back so quickly?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.126,id:UT22084-001-006-398}}}She explained everything, and the other female slaves began to go to Pūrṇa with her. Pūrṇa was again surrounded by merchants, businessmen, caravan leaders, and servants, and when they left, he gave the female slave of Bhavila’s wife the day’s money. The other two female slaves also quickly obtained the money. Their mistresses asked, “How is it that you came back so quickly this time?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.127,id:UT22084-001-006-399}}}They said, “May the eldest mistress be free from illness. When her female slave goes, Pūrṇa gives the money to her. So we go with her.” 
Unable to bear it, the two wives again remarked, {{page:{number:44,id:UT22084-001-006-7872,folio:F.299.a,volume:V1}}} “Such a thing occurs when sons of slave women come into power in someone’s house.”
{{milestone:{label:2.128,id:UT22084-001-006-401}}}Later, Bhavila, Bhavatrāta, and Bhavanandin returned from the great ocean, joyfully, having succeeded on their voyage. Bhavila asked his wife, “Good lady, did Pūrṇa protect you well?” 
 “He was as good to me as a brother or a son,” she replied.
{{milestone:{label:2.129,id:UT22084-001-006-403}}}When the other two husbands asked their wives the same, the wives remarked yet again, “These are things that occur when sons of slave women come into power in someone’s house.” 
The two brothers thought, “Women usually split friends apart.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.130,id:UT22084-001-006-405}}}Later, immediately after the store of cloth from Kāśi was opened, Bhavila’s son came, and Pūrṇa dressed him with a piece of cloth from Kāśi. The wives of the two younger brothers saw the cloth and asked, “Child, who gave you this?” 
“Uncle gave it to me,” answered the child.
{{milestone:{label:2.131,id:UT22084-001-006-407}}}Having seen such cloth, the other wives also sent their own sons. But, unfortunately for them, the store of cloth from Kāśi was closed and only the store of rough cloth was open, and so Pūrṇa dressed them in rough cloth. Seeing this, the wives of the two younger brothers complained to their husbands, “Did you see that? He gives cloth from Kāśi to one while he gives rough cloth to the others.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.132,id:UT22084-001-006-408}}}The husbands answered, “That is definitely because when the boys arrived the store of cloth from Kāśi was closed, but the store of rough cloth was open.” 
“Give it more thought,” said their wives.
{{milestone:{label:2.133,id:UT22084-001-006-410}}}Later, when the store of śarkarā was opened, Bhavila’s son came and got a bowl full of śarkarā. {{page:{number:45,id:UT22084-001-006-7873,folio:F.299.b,volume:V1}}} When Bhavila’s son returned home carrying the śarkarā, the wives of the younger brothers saw him and asked, “Child, who gave you this?” 
“Uncle gave it to me,” answered the child.
{{milestone:{label:2.134,id:UT22084-001-006-412}}}The two wives also sent their own sons. But unfortunately for them, the store of śarkarā was closed and only the store of guḍa was open. Since they came when only the store of guḍa was open, they got guḍa. “Did you see that?” the wives complained again. “Pūrṇa gives śarkarā to the one while he gives guḍa to the others.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.135,id:UT22084-001-006-413}}}Having seen all that, the wives tried to alienate their husbands from one another in order to split up the household. The two younger brothers discussed the matter together: “Since our household has been ruined for good, we should divide it.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.136,id:UT22084-001-006-414}}}One suggested, “Let’s call our eldest brother.” 
The other replied, “For the time being, let’s consider how to divide the household ourselves.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.137,id:UT22084-001-006-416}}}The two then considered it independently and thought, “One will take what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, another will take what there is in the store and what there is abroad, and the third will take Pūrṇa. If our eldest brother takes what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, we will be able to live on what there is in the store and what there is abroad. And if our eldest brother takes what there is in the store and what there is abroad, we will be able to live on what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, and we will also be able to torment Pūrṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:2.138,id:UT22084-001-006-417}}}Thus the two brothers discussed the matter. They went to Bhavila and said, “Since our family relations have dissolved, we are going to divide the household.” 
“I think we should do this after we have carefully analyzed the situation,” Bhavila replied, “because it is usually women who break up households.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.139,id:UT22084-001-006-419}}}“We have already analyzed the situation,” said the other two, {{page:{number:46,id:UT22084-001-006-7874,folio:F.300.a,volume:V1}}} “so we are going to divide the household.” 
“Then call five arbitrators,” said Bhavila.
{{milestone:{label:2.140,id:UT22084-001-006-421}}}“Why do we need five arbitrators when we have already figured out the division of the household?” asked the two brothers. “One will take what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, another will take what there is in the store and what there is abroad, and the third will take Pūrṇa.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.141,id:UT22084-001-006-422}}}“Why do you not give Pūrṇa his share?” asked Bhavila.
“Who gives a share to the son of a slave woman?” the other two answered. “Not only that, he himself is one of the things we have apportioned. If you want Pūrṇa, take him.”
{{milestone:{label:2.142,id:UT22084-001-006-424}}}Bhavila thought, “Father ordered me: ‘You should not abandon Pūrṇa even if you part with your entire estate.’ So I should take Pūrṇa.” He then said, “If that is how it is, then I will provide for Pūrṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:2.143,id:UT22084-001-006-425}}}The brother who took possession of what there was in the house and what there was in the farm went quickly to the house and called out, “Sister, get out of here!” 
When Bhavila’s wife stepped out, he shouted, “Don’t come back again!”
{{milestone:{label:2.144,id:UT22084-001-006-427}}}“Why?”
“Because we have divided what belongs to the household.”
{{milestone:{label:2.145,id:UT22084-001-006-429}}}The brother who took possession of what there was in the store and what there was abroad went quickly to the store and called out, “Pūrṇa, come down!” 
When Pūrṇa came down, the brother said, “You cannot go up to the store anymore.”
{{milestone:{label:2.146,id:UT22084-001-006-431}}}“Why?”
“We divided the household. What there is abroad and what there is in the store are mine.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.147,id:UT22084-001-006-433}}}“Give me my share,” said Pūrṇa.
The brother retorted, “Why should we give a share to you, the son of a slave woman? Not only that, you yourself are one of the things we have apportioned. You have been taken by our eldest brother.”
{{milestone:{label:2.148,id:UT22084-001-006-435}}}When Bhavila’s wife went with Pūrṇa to the house of a kinsman, her children {{page:{number:47,id:UT22084-001-006-7875,folio:F.300.b,volume:V1}}} began to cry from hunger. She implored him, “Pūrṇa, give my children something to eat.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.149,id:UT22084-001-006-436}}}“Give me a kārṣāpaṇa,” said Pūrṇa.
“You earned a hundred thousand pieces of gold,” she replied. “Do you not have something for the children to eat?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.150,id:UT22084-001-006-438}}}“How could I have known that your family would come to be needy like this?” said Pūrṇa in return. “If I had known that, I would have prepared hundreds of thousands of gold pieces.”
{{milestone:{label:2.151,id:UT22084-001-006-439}}}It is commonplace for women to carry a few brass coins wrapped in the hems of their garments. Bhavila’s wife gave Pūrṇa a brass coin and said, “Bring something to eat.”
{{milestone:{label:2.152,id:UT22084-001-006-440}}}Taking the coin with him, Pūrṇa went to the market, where he saw a man carrying a bundle of wood that had been cast ashore by the ocean waves. The man was shivering with cold, and Pūrṇa asked him, “Say, why are you shivering like this?” 
“I don’t know,” answered the man, “but I grow cold like this whenever I carry this bundle of wood even briefly.”
{{milestone:{label:2.153,id:UT22084-001-006-442}}}Pūrṇa, who was learned in the analysis of wood, began to analyze the wood and found in it a piece of gośīrṣacandana. He asked the man, “Say, how much would you sell this for?”
“For five hundred kārṣāpaṇas.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.154,id:UT22084-001-006-444}}}Pūrṇa took the bundle of wood, extracted the piece of gośīrṣacandana, went to the market, sawed it into four pieces, sold just the sawdust for a thousand kārṣāpaṇas, and gave the man five hundred kārṣāpaṇas, saying, “Since Bhavila’s wife is staying at such-and-such a house, take this bundle of wood there and say that Pūrṇa sent it.”
{{milestone:{label:2.155,id:UT22084-001-006-445}}}When the man had brought the wood and told her what happened, Bhavila’s wife, beating her breast, cried out, “So did Pūrṇa also lose his mind after he lost his estate? I sent him to find something to be cooked. {{page:{number:48,id:UT22084-001-006-7876,folio:F.301.a,volume:V1}}} Instead, he sent something to kindle a fire with, but nothing to be cooked!”
{{milestone:{label:2.156,id:UT22084-001-006-446}}}Later, the king of Sūrpāraka came down with a serious fever and was semiconscious. The physician prescribed gośīrṣacandana for him, and so the ministers began to look for gośīrṣacandana. They heard talk in the market and went to Pūrṇa. The ministers asked him, “Do you have gośīrṣacandana?” 
“I do.”
{{milestone:{label:2.157,id:UT22084-001-006-448}}}“How much would you sell it for?”
“For a thousand kārṣāpaṇas.”
{{milestone:{label:2.158,id:UT22084-001-006-450}}}The ministers bought the gośīrṣacandana for a thousand kārṣāpaṇas, and when they anointed the king with it, he recovered his health. The king thought, “What sort of house has gośīrṣacandana in it?” The king asked his ministers, “Where did this come from?” 
“From Pūrṇa, Your Majesty,” answered the ministers.
{{milestone:{label:2.159,id:UT22084-001-006-452}}}“Call Pūrṇa here.”
A messenger went to Pūrṇa and told him, “Pūrṇa, His Majesty will speak with you.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.160,id:UT22084-001-006-454}}}Pūrṇa wondered, “Why would the king speak with me?” He then thought further, “Since he recovered his health on account of gośīrṣacandana, he would speak with me about gośīrṣacandana. So I should take all the gośīrṣacandana with me.”
{{milestone:{label:2.161,id:UT22084-001-006-455}}}Pūrṇa wrapped three pieces of gośīrṣacandana with cloth, held another piece in his hand, and went to the king. The king asked, “Pūrṇa, do you have any gośīrṣacandana?” 
“Your Majesty, here it is,” Pūrṇa answered.
{{milestone:{label:2.162,id:UT22084-001-006-457}}}“What is the price of this?”
“A hundred thousand pieces of gold.”
{{milestone:{label:2.163,id:UT22084-001-006-459}}}“Do you have any more?”
“I do, Your Majesty,” Pūrṇa said, showing him, one by one, the three other pieces of gośīrṣacandana. The king ordered his ministers, “Pay Pūrṇa four hundred thousand pieces of gold.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.164,id:UT22084-001-006-461}}}“Your Majesty,” said Pūrṇa, “give me three hundred thousand. I will present one to Your Majesty as a gift.” 
The king gave three hundred thousand pieces of gold to Pūrṇa and said, “Pūrṇa, I am pleased with you. {{page:{number:49,id:UT22084-001-006-7877,folio:F.301.b,volume:V1}}} So, tell me whatever you most want and I will give it to you.”

{{milestone:{label:2.166,id:UT22084-001-006-465}}}Later, five hundred merchants came to the city of Sūrpāraka, having succeeded on their voyage on the great ocean. The guild of merchants in Sūrpāraka made a private agreement: “None of us should go alone to the foreign merchants. If someone goes alone, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed. We should gather our merchandise together.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.167,id:UT22084-001-006-466}}}One of them said, “We should call Pūrṇa, too.”
“What is the use of calling that poor man?” asked another.
{{milestone:{label:2.168,id:UT22084-001-006-468}}}At that time Pūrṇa went out and heard that five hundred merchants had come to the city of Sūrpāraka, having succeeded on their voyage on the great ocean. Pūrṇa, without entering the city, went to the foreign merchants and asked, “Sirs, what are these goods?” 
“They are this and that,” they answered.
{{milestone:{label:2.169,id:UT22084-001-006-470}}}“What is their price?”
“Caravan leader, wherever you go you only ask questions.{{note:{index71,id:UT22084-001-006-300013}}}”
{{milestone:{label:2.170,id:UT22084-001-006-473}}}“Even so, tell me the price,” Pūrṇa insisted.
The merchants priced the goods at one million, eight hundred thousand pieces of gold. Pūrṇa said, “Sirs, here are three hundred thousand pieces of gold for a deposit. This merchandise is mine. I will pay the balance when I get home.”
{{milestone:{label:2.171,id:UT22084-001-006-475}}}“Please do so,” they said, and Pūrṇa paid three hundred thousand pieces of gold as a deposit, placed his own seal on the merchandise, and departed.
{{milestone:{label:2.172,id:UT22084-001-006-476}}}Later, the guild of merchants sent servants, telling them, “Go see what goods there are.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.173,id:UT22084-001-006-477}}}They went and asked, “What are these goods?”
“They are this and that.”

“Whether full or not, these goods have already been sold,” said the foreign merchants.
{{milestone:{label:2.175,id:UT22084-001-006-481}}}“To whom did you sell them?”
“To Pūrṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:2.176,id:UT22084-001-006-483}}}“You must have made a great profit if you sold it to Pūrṇa.”
The merchants said, “You would not pay even for full price what he paid as a deposit.”
{{milestone:{label:2.177,id:UT22084-001-006-485}}}“How much did he pay as a deposit?”
“Three hundred thousand pieces of gold.”
{{milestone:{label:2.178,id:UT22084-001-006-487}}}“He must have stolen the gold from his brothers.”
The servants went back and reported to the guild of merchants, “Those goods have already been sold.”
{{milestone:{label:2.179,id:UT22084-001-006-489}}}“To whom?”
“To Pūrṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:2.180,id:UT22084-001-006-491}}}“They must have made a great profit if they sold it to Pūrṇa.”

“Three hundred thousand pieces of gold.”
“He must have stolen the gold from his brothers.”
{{milestone:{label:2.182,id:UT22084-001-006-496}}}They called Pūrṇa and said, “Pūrṇa, why did you take the merchandise when the guild of merchants had an agreement: ‘None should take the merchandise alone, but{{note:{index72,id:UT22084-001-006-497}}} only the guild of merchants should take it’?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.183,id:UT22084-001-006-498}}}“Sirs,” he replied, “when you made the agreement, did you tell me or my brothers? You made the agreement without me. You alone should keep it.”
{{milestone:{label:2.184,id:UT22084-001-006-499}}}The guild of merchants then became angry. They seized Pūrṇa and placed him in the sun so that he would pay sixty kārṣāpanas. The king’s men witnessed this and told the king. 
“Sirs, summon them,” ordered the king.
{{milestone:{label:2.185,id:UT22084-001-006-501}}}When the king’s men had summoned the merchants, the king asked them, “Sirs, why did you seize Pūrṇa and place him in the sun?”
“Your Majesty, we did so because the guild of merchants had an agreement that none should trade by themselves, but he engaged in trade by himself.”
{{milestone:{label:2.186,id:UT22084-001-006-503}}}“Your Majesty,” said Pūrṇa, “please ask them whether they told me or my brothers when they made the agreement.” {{page:{number:51,id:UT22084-001-006-7879,folio:F.302.b,volume:V1}}}
“Sirs, Pūrṇa’s claim is fair,” said the king.
{{milestone:{label:2.187,id:UT22084-001-006-505}}}The merchants were ashamed, and they freed Pūrṇa.
Later, when the king needed an item, he summoned the guild of merchants and ordered them, “Sirs, since I need such-and-such an item, present it to me.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.188,id:UT22084-001-006-507}}}“Your Majesty, Pūrṇa has it,” they replied.
“Since I cannot order him,” said the king, “buy it from him and present it to me.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.189,id:UT22084-001-006-509}}}The merchants sent a messenger to Pūrṇa, who told him, “The guild of merchants calls you.” 
“I will not go,” answered Pūrṇa.
{{milestone:{label:2.190,id:UT22084-001-006-511}}}Then all the members of the guild of merchants assembled, went to Pūrṇa’s house, stood at the door, and sent him a message: “Pūrṇa, the guild of merchants is at your door. Come out!”
{{milestone:{label:2.191,id:UT22084-001-006-512}}}When Pūrṇa came out arrogantly, with pride and haughtiness, the guild of merchants said, “Caravan leader, please sell your merchandise at the price you paid for it.” 
“If I sell my merchandise at the price I paid for it, I would surely be such a great merchant, wouldn’t I?” said Pūrṇa.
{{milestone:{label:2.192,id:UT22084-001-006-515}}}The merchants replied, “Sell it at twice the price and the guild of merchants will be honored.” 
“The guild of merchants should be honored,” thought Pūrṇa. He then sold it at twice the price of one million, five hundred thousand. 
{{milestone:{label:2.193,id:UT22084-001-006-516}}}After Pūrṇa hid the remaining money in his house, he thought, “How can I fill a vessel with dew drops? I will take to the great ocean.” In order to take to the great ocean, he issued a proclamation in the city of Sūrpāraka with the ringing of bells: “Sirs, merchants living in the city of Sūrpāraka, listen! The caravan leader Pūrṇa will take to the great ocean. Whoever among you who wants to take to the great ocean with the caravan leader Pūrṇa, free from taxes, duties, and boatman’s fees, should prepare your merchandise to carry across the great ocean.” {{page:{number:52,id:UT22084-001-006-7880,folio:F.303.a,volume:V1}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.194,id:UT22084-001-006-517}}}Five hundred merchants prepared their merchandise to carry across the great ocean. Then the caravan leader Pūrṇa, after performing rituals that bring good fortune, blessings, and well-being, took to the great ocean with his retinue and the five hundred merchants, and then returned to the city of Sūrpāraka, having succeeded on his voyage.
{{milestone:{label:2.195,id:UT22084-001-006-518}}}Six times Pūrṇa took to the great ocean and returned, having succeeded on each voyage.
Everywhere it was said, “Six times Pūrṇa took to the great ocean and returned, having succeeded on each voyage.” Then, the merchants of Śrāvastī came to the city of Sūrpāraka bearing their merchandise. After they were fully rested, they went to the caravan leader Pūrṇa. When they arrived, they said, “Caravan leader, let us leave for the great ocean.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.196,id:UT22084-001-006-520}}}“Sirs,” Pūrṇa replied, “have any of you ever seen or heard of anyone who, six times, returned from the great ocean after succeeding on each voyage, and was going a seventh time?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.197,id:UT22084-001-006-521}}}“Pūrṇa, we came a long way to see you. If you do not go, we will not go either because you are the authority,” the merchants said.
Pūrṇa thought, “Although there is no wealth at all that I need, I will go for the sake of these people.” Then Pūrṇa left for the great ocean together with the merchants. 
{{milestone:{label:2.198,id:UT22084-001-006-523}}}At dawn the merchants recited the Udāna, Pārāyaṇa, Satyadṛś, Sthaviragāthā, Sthavirīgāthā, Śailagāthā, Munigāthā, and Arthavargīya Sūtras.{{note:{index73,id:UT22084-001-006-524}}} Pūrṇa heard them and said, “Sirs, you are singing good songs.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.199,id:UT22084-001-006-526}}}“Caravan leader,” they replied, “these are not songs.”
“Then what are they?”
“They are the words of the Buddha.”{{note:{index74,id:UT22084-001-006-528}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.200,id:UT22084-001-006-529}}}When Pūrṇa heard the sound buddha, a word he had never heard before, the hairs in every pore of his body stood on end. Pūrṇa asked reverently, {{page:{number:53,id:UT22084-001-006-7881,folio:F.303.b,volume:V1}}} “Sirs, who is the Buddha?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.201,id:UT22084-001-006-531}}}The merchants explained, “There is a son of the Śākyans, a śramaṇa{{note:{index75,id:UT22084-001-006-532}}} of the Gautama family, who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes.

“Caravan leader, he is staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.”
{{milestone:{label:2.203,id:UT22084-001-006-535}}}Keeping this in mind, Pūrṇa took to the great ocean together with them and came back, having succeeded on his voyage. 
{{milestone:{label:2.204,id:UT22084-001-006-536}}}His brother Bhavila thought, “He is tired from continually traveling the great ocean. He should get married.” He then asked Pūrṇa, “Tell me, which daughter of which{{note:{index76,id:UT22084-001-006-537}}} merchant, businessman, or caravan leader shall I request for you?” 
“I do not want an object of desire,” Pūrṇa replied. “If you allow it, I will go forth.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.205,id:UT22084-001-006-539}}}“You did not go forth when we were not engaged in the family business. Why do you go forth now?” asked Bhavila.
“It was not appropriate then,” replied Pūrṇa. “It is appropriate now.” 
Bhavila, knowing he would insist, allowed Pūrṇa to go forth. 
{{milestone:{label:2.206,id:UT22084-001-006-542}}}“Brother,” said Pūrṇa, “there is much danger and little to gain on the great ocean. Many people take to it but only a few of them return. So you should never take to the great ocean. You have abundant wealth gained properly, while your brothers have what was gained improperly. So you should not live with them if they ask you to live together.”
{{milestone:{label:2.207,id:UT22084-001-006-543}}}Pūrṇa went to Śrāvastī with a servant. He stayed in the park of Śrāvastī and sent his servant as a messenger to the householder Anāthapiṇḍada, saying, “Householder, the caravan leader Pūrṇa is staying in the park of Śrāvastī, hoping to meet you.” {{page:{number:54,id:UT22084-001-006-7882,folio:F.304.a,volume:V1}}}

“What merchandise? He came only with me, a servant.”
{{milestone:{label:2.209,id:UT22084-001-006-546}}}“It would not be appropriate for me to invite that important person to my house without honoring him,” thought Anāthapiṇḍada. So, he invited Pūrṇa to his house with great honor: he offered him a massage, let him bathe, and gave him food. When they sat down, talking pleasantly, Anāthapiṇḍada asked, “Caravan leader, what is the purpose of your coming here?”
“Householder, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.”
{{milestone:{label:2.210,id:UT22084-001-006-548}}}Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍada stretched his upper body, raised his right hand, and spoke an inspired utterance: “O Buddha, O Dharma, O Saṅgha!

A great person like this, abandoning a great many relatives and friends and full treasuries and warehouses, now wishes to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.”
{{milestone:{label:2.211,id:UT22084-001-006-549}}}Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍada took the caravan leader Pūrṇa to the Blessed One. At that time the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma, seated before an audience of many hundreds of monks. When the Blessed One saw the householder Anāthapiṇḍada coming with a gift, he said to the monks, “Monks, the householder Anāthapiṇḍada is coming with a gift. For the Tathāgata, there is no gift equal to this, a person to be tamed.” {{page:{number:55,id:UT22084-001-006-7883,folio:F.304.b,volume:V1}}}

{{milestone:{label:2.213,id:UT22084-001-006-551}}}The Blessed One assented to the householder Anāthapiṇḍada by remaining silent. Then the Blessed One said to the caravan leader Pūrṇa, “Come, monk, lead the pure life.”  As soon as the Blessed One said this, Pūrṇa’s hair fell out and he was clad in his outer robe, with but a week’s worth of hair and beard, his bowl and pitcher in his hand, and standing like a monk who had been ordained a hundred years earlier.

The smoke of the incense was woven together like a cloud. The water assumed the shape of a lapis lazuli vessel. Since the venerable Ānanda was familiar with omens, he made the gesture of supplication and asked the Blessed One, “Honored One, where is this invitation from?”
“From Sūrpāraka, Ānanda.”

{{milestone:{label:2.275,id:UT22084-001-006-648}}}Although the venerable elder Pūrṇa had been liberated through wisdom, he had not attained magical power. Therefore he asked himself, “Why am I disheartened by lack of magical power even like that of the non-Buddhist ascetics when I have searched for the whole collection of defilements within myself, discarded all the defilements, abandoned them, and driven them away?”
{{milestone:{label:2.276,id:UT22084-001-006-649}}}The venerable elder Pūrṇa exerted his vigor and gave rise to magical power. He stretched his arm, which was like the trunk of an elephant, and took a counting stick before the venerable Ānanda passed a counting stick to a third elder, and the venerable elder Pūrṇa spoke this verse:

“No,” Pūrṇa replied. “They are the monks who are the most venerable of the elders who have come by practicing dhyāna.”
{{milestone:{label:2.287,id:UT22084-001-006-662}}}A lay brother then spoke this verse:
“Some come riding lions, tigers, elephants, horses, nāgas, or bulls;

And others come through the sky, like clouds adorned by garlands of lightning, joyfully,

When the Blessed One put his foot down with a specific intention in the perfume chamber, the great earth quaked in six ways. This great earth quaked, quaked furiously, and quaked absolutely furiously. It roared, roared furiously, and roared absolutely furiously. When the eastern side rose, the western side sank.

{{milestone:{label:2.293,id:UT22084-001-006-671}}}A god who lived in the Jetavana followed the Blessed One, holding a branch of vakula with which he provided shade for him. The Blessed One knew the god’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him, and caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. When the god had heard the Dharma, he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.
{{milestone:{label:2.294,id:UT22084-001-006-672}}}There then lived in another place about five hundred widows, and they saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, {{page:{number:70,id:UT22084-001-006-7898,folio:F.2.a,volume:V2}}} ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels whose light surpasses a thousand suns. As soon as the five hundred widows saw him, great faith in the Blessed One arose in them.
{{milestone:{label:2.295,id:UT22084-001-006-673}}}It is commonplace that when beings who possess the cause of having accumulated roots of merit look at the Buddha for the first time, they experience far greater pleasure than that of those who have practiced tranquility of mind for a dozen years, those who gain a son after having been childless, those who look upon treasure after having been poor, or those who are anointed as king after having longed for kingship.
{{milestone:{label:2.296,id:UT22084-001-006-674}}}After that, the Blessed One knew that it was the right time to train the widows, and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. The women bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then they sat down to one side. The Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivities, dispositions, and nature . . . and they actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After seeing the four truths of the noble ones, they spoke an inspired utterance three times: “Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for us is what has never been done for us by our mothers, our fathers, a king, gods, our husbands, our kinsmen and relatives, ancestral spirits, śramaṇas, or brahmins. {{page:{number:71,id:UT22084-001-006-7899,folio:F.2.b,volume:V2}}} You have dried up the ocean of blood and tears, liberated us from the mountain of bones, shut the gate to inferior states of existence,{{note:{index96,id:UT22084-001-006-675}}} opened the gates to liberation and heaven, and placed us among gods and humans. O Honored One, we have been exalted, truly exalted! Since we seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, may the Blessed One accept us as lay sisters.”
{{milestone:{label:2.297,id:UT22084-001-006-676}}}They rose from their seats, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and implored the Blessed One, “O Blessed One, please give us something to worship.”
{{milestone:{label:2.298,id:UT22084-001-006-677}}}The Blessed One{{note:{index97,id:UT22084-001-006-678}}} then cut off his hair and nails by means of his magical power and gave his hair and nails to the widows. They built a stūpa for the hair and nails of the Blessed One. After that, the god who lived in the Jetavana planted a vakula tree along the stūpa’s circumambulatory path, and then the god who lived in the Jetavana said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will stay here, worshiping this stūpa.”
{{milestone:{label:2.299,id:UT22084-001-006-679}}}The god who lived in the Jetavana stayed there. Some people named the place the widows’ stūpa, and other people named it the circumambulatory path of the vakula. Monks who worship the stūpa worship the place even now.
{{milestone:{label:2.300,id:UT22084-001-006-680}}}The Blessed One then departed.{{note:{index98,id:UT22084-001-006-681}}} At that time, there lived five hundred ṛṣis in a hermitage. Since the hermitage was abundant in flowers, fruits, and water, the ṛṣis were intoxicated with those things and were without worries. The Blessed One then knew that it was the right time to train the five hundred ṛṣis and went to the hermitage. When the Blessed One arrived, with his magical power he destroyed the flowers and fruits of the hermitage, dried up the water, dug up the meadow, and smashed the residence to pieces. The ṛṣis were then plunged into grief, resting their cheeks on their hands. {{page:{number:72,id:UT22084-001-006-7900,folio:F.3.a,volume:V2}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.301,id:UT22084-001-006-682}}}The Blessed One asked, “Why are you plunged into grief?”
“Blessed One,” they replied, “after you, a human field of merit, came here, we were placed in a grievous situation.”
{{milestone:{label:2.302,id:UT22084-001-006-684}}}The Blessed One then asked, “Ṛṣis, why was the hermitage, which was abundant in flowers, fruits, and water, ruined? Shall I make the hermitage as it was before?”
“Blessed One, please do so.”
{{milestone:{label:2.303,id:UT22084-001-006-686}}}The Blessed One then ceased his magical power, and the hermitage became as it had been before. Thus, the five hundred ṛṣis were very much astonished, and their minds were filled with faith in the Blessed One. The Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivities, dispositions, and natures, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. When the five hundred ṛṣis had heard the Dharma, they actualized the fruit of a never-returner and achieved magical power. They then made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said, “Honored One, we wish to go forth and be ordained monks in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. We will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:2.304,id:UT22084-001-006-687}}}Then the Blessed One, using the “Come, monk” formula of ordination, said, “Come, monks, lead the pure life.”  As soon as the Blessed One said this, their hair fell out and they were clad in their outer robes, with but a week’s worth of hair and beards, their bowls and pitchers in their hands, standing like monks who had been ordained a hundred years earlier.
{{milestone:{label:2.305,id:UT22084-001-006-688}}}Because the Tathāgata said “come,”
Their hair fell out and they were clad in their outer robes,
Their faculties at once calmed,
And their bodies swathed in the Buddha’s mind.{{note:{index99,id:UT22084-001-006-689}}}{{page:{number:73,id:UT22084-001-006-7901,folio:F.3.b,volume:V2}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.306,id:UT22084-001-006-690}}} Exerting themselves, endeavoring and striving, they came to understand saṃsāra’s ever-revolving five cycles, overthrew all conditioned states . . . and the five hundred ṛṣis became objects of veneration, respect, and praise for the gods including Indra and Upendra.  The ṛṣi who was their leader said, “Blessed One, I deceived many people in this guise. I will go forth after making the people’s faith arise.”
{{milestone:{label:2.307,id:UT22084-001-006-691}}}Then the Blessed One, surrounded, in the shape of a half-moon, by the five hundred ṛṣis and monks who had been monks from the beginning, soared with them into the air from there using his magical power, and arrived in due course at Mount Musalaka.
{{milestone:{label:2.308,id:UT22084-001-006-692}}}At that time there lived a ṛṣi on Mount Musalaka named Vakkalin.{{note:{index100,id:UT22084-001-006-693}}} He saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man . . . . As soon as Vakkalin saw the Blessed One, his mind was filled with faith in the Blessed One. When Vakkalin’s faith had arisen, he thought, “Now I will descend from the mountain and go to meet the Blessed One. The Blessed One may pass through here out of consideration for people to be trained. Therefore, I will now throw myself off the mountain.”
{{milestone:{label:2.309,id:UT22084-001-006-694}}}Thinking thus, Vakkalin threw himself from the top of the mountain. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, have a watchful nature, the Blessed One caught him with his magical power. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him. When Vakkalin had heard the Dharma, he actualized the fruit of a never-returner and achieved magical power. Then Vakkalin said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya . . . .” {{page:{number:74,id:UT22084-001-006-7902,folio:F.4.a,volume:V2}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.310,id:UT22084-001-006-695}}}Then the Blessed One, saying “Come, monk,” . . . . 
. . . 
And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind. 
{{milestone:{label:2.311,id:UT22084-001-006-698}}}Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, it is he, the monk Vakkalin, who is the best of the monks who were emancipated by faith.”
{{milestone:{label:2.312,id:UT22084-001-006-699}}}After that, the Blessed One, surrounded by a thousand monks, performing miracles, went to the city of Sūrpāraka. The Blessed One thought, “If I enter from one gate, those who are at the other gates will be disappointed. Thus, I will enter by using my magical power.”
{{milestone:{label:2.313,id:UT22084-001-006-700}}}So the Blessed One entered the city of Sūrpāraka from the sky using his magical power. Then the king, the ruler of Sūrpāraka, and the venerable Pūrṇa, Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin, as well as the seventeen princes, went to the Blessed One along with the attendants of each one and hundreds of thousands of other beings.
{{milestone:{label:2.314,id:UT22084-001-006-701}}}After that, the Blessed One, accompanied by hundreds of thousands of beings, went to the palace garlanded with sandalwood and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. Since the large crowd could not see the Blessed One, the crowd started to destroy the palace garlanded with sandalwood. The Blessed One thought, “If the palace garlanded with sandalwood is destroyed, such destruction will decrease the donors’ merit. Now I will transform this palace into a palace made of crystal.” The Blessed One transformed the palace into a palace made of crystal so that the large crowd could see the Buddha’s body without obstructions blocking the view.
{{milestone:{label:2.315,id:UT22084-001-006-702}}}The Blessed One knew the audience’s thinking, proclivities, {{page:{number:75,id:UT22084-001-006-7903,folio:F.4.b,volume:V2}}} dispositions, and natures, and so preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. When the audience had heard the Dharma, hundreds of thousands of beings attained great excellence. Some generated the roots of merit of liberation, some generated the roots of merit of penetration, some actualized the fruit of stream-entry, some the fruit of a never-returner, and some went forth, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat. Some generated the intention for the awakening of disciples, some the intention for the awakening of a self-awakened one, and some the intention for complete and supreme awakening.
{{milestone:{label:2.316,id:UT22084-001-006-9449}}}Most of the audience became absorbed in the Buddha, devoted to the Dharma, and inclined to the Saṅgha.
{{milestone:{label:2.317,id:UT22084-001-006-704}}}Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin then prepared a pure and fine meal, arranged seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.”{{note:{index101,id:UT22084-001-006-705}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.318,id:UT22084-001-006-706}}}At that time there lived in the great ocean two nāga kings named Kṛṣṇa and Gautama. They both thought, “Since the Blessed One is preaching the Dharma in the city of Sūrpāraka, let’s go to listen to the Dharma.” Then they both, along with five hundred nāga attendants, departed for the city of Sūrpāraka, creating five hundred rivers flowing toward the city. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, have a watchful nature, the Blessed One thought, “If these two nāga kings, Kṛṣṇa and Gautama, come to the city of Sūrpāraka, they will ruin the country.” The Blessed One then said to the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:76,id:UT22084-001-006-7904,folio:F.5.a,volume:V2}}} “Maudgalyāyana, accept the alms requiring haste by the Tathāgata. Why, Maudgalyāyana? Because there are five kinds of alms requiring haste.{{note:{index102,id:UT22084-001-006-707}}} What are the five? The almsfood of temporary visitors, of those who are setting forth on a journey, of sick people, of those attending the sick, and of monks responsible for monastic property.”{{note:{index103,id:UT22084-001-006-708}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.319,id:UT22084-001-006-709}}}In this situation, the Blessed One intended that the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana would be the monk who was responsible for monastic property.
{{milestone:{label:2.320,id:UT22084-001-006-710}}}The Blessed One soared up into the air from there, using his magical power. The two, the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, went to the nāga kings Kṛṣṇa and Gautama. When the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had arrived, the Blessed One said, “Lords of nāgas, you should be attentive to the city of Sūrpāraka, and you should not destroy the country.”
{{milestone:{label:2.321,id:UT22084-001-006-711}}}“Honored One,” said the nāga kings, “we have come here with faith, because of which we never harm any beings, even ants, to say nothing of the people living in the city of Sūrpāraka.”
{{milestone:{label:2.322,id:UT22084-001-006-712}}}After that, the Blessed One preached the Dharma to the nāga kings Kṛṣṇa and Gautama, the hearing of which caused them to seek refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and to accept the rules of training.
{{milestone:{label:2.323,id:UT22084-001-006-713}}}When the Blessed One had begun his meal, each nāga thought, “Ah, may the Blessed One drink my water!”
The Blessed One thought, “If I drink water from only one individual, it will disappoint the others. Therefore, I must devise a plan to drink the water of everyone.”
{{milestone:{label:2.324,id:UT22084-001-006-715}}}Then the Blessed One instructed the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, go and bring water from the very point where the five hundred rivers meet.”
{{milestone:{label:2.325,id:UT22084-001-006-716}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, and he filled a bowl with water at the very point where the five hundred rivers met and returned to the Blessed One, bringing the water with him. When he arrived, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana offered the bowl of water to the Blessed One, {{page:{number:77,id:UT22084-001-006-7905,folio:F.5.b,volume:V2}}} and the Blessed One accepted the water and drank it.
{{milestone:{label:2.326,id:UT22084-001-006-717}}}The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana thought,{{note:{index104,id:UT22084-001-006-718}}} “The Blessed One once said,{{note:{index105,id:UT22084-001-006-719}}} ‘Monks, fathers and mothers do what is quite difficult to do because they nourish their children, raise them, bring them up, feed them, and teach them everything on the continent of Jambu. Even if a son should try to carry his parents, his mother on one shoulder and his father on the other, for a hundred years; if he should give them the earth’s jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, glass, coral, silver, gold, agate, amber, ruby, and shells; or if he should put his parents in a position of power, the son cannot truly help or sufficiently repay his father and mother with such efforts. If a person motivates his parents to have complete faith, and leads them to, leads them to enter into, and leads them to stand safely in their faith when they do not have faith; if he motivates them to have completely good conduct when they have disordered conduct; if he motivates them to be completely generous when they are ungenerous; if he motivates them to have complete intelligence, and leads them to, leads them to enter into, and leads them to stand safely in their intelligence when they have disordered intelligence, he comes to truly help and repay his father and mother with just such efforts.’ Since I have not yet repaid my mother, now I will consider where my mother has been reborn.”
{{milestone:{label:2.327,id:UT22084-001-006-720}}}When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana considered this, he found that she had been reborn in the Marīcika world. Then he observed by whom she should be trained and found that it was the Blessed One. He thought, “Since I have come here from a distance, I will by all means tell this to the Blessed One.” The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, the Blessed One once said, ‘Monks, fathers and mothers do what is quite difficult to do.’ {{page:{number:78,id:UT22084-001-006-7906,folio:F.6.a,volume:V2}}} My mother has been reborn in the Marīcika world and she is one who should be trained by the Blessed One. May the Blessed One have compassion and train her.”
{{milestone:{label:2.328,id:UT22084-001-006-721}}}“Maudgalyāyana, by whose magical power shall we go there?” asked the Blessed One.
“By mine, Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:2.329,id:UT22084-001-006-723}}}Then the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana departed, stepping on the summit of Mount Sumeru, and arrived in the Marīcika world after seven days.
{{milestone:{label:2.330,id:UT22084-001-006-724}}}When she, Bhadrakanyā,{{note:{index106,id:UT22084-001-006-725}}} saw the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana from a distance, she was delighted, and she went to him and said, “Ah, I see my son after so long! Ah, I see my son after so long!”
{{milestone:{label:2.331,id:UT22084-001-006-726}}}Then a large crowd asked, “Sirs, how is this girl the mother of this mendicant who is so old?”
“Sirs,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “this woman bore this body of mine. Thus, she is my mother.”
{{milestone:{label:2.332,id:UT22084-001-006-728}}}The Blessed One knew Bhadrakanyā’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her and that caused her to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.  When Bhadrakanyā had heard the Dharma, she leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After she had seen the truths, she spoke an inspired utterance three times: “. . . you placed me among gods and humans.” Again, she said:{{note:{index107,id:UT22084-001-006-729}}}

{{milestone:{label:2.337,id:UT22084-001-006-734}}}The Blessed One assented to Bhadrakanyā’s request by remaining silent, and Bhadrakanyā understood the Blessed One’s assent. Then Bhadrakanyā knew that the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had sat down in comfort, and with her own hands she served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal. When she had, with her own hands, served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, she took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One then preached the Dharma to Bhadrakanyā. When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had taken the Blessed One’s bowl and washed it, the Blessed One said, “Maudgalyāyana, shall we go?”

“We have arrived, Maudgalyāyana.”
{{milestone:{label:2.341,id:UT22084-001-006-741}}}The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana was astonished and asked, “Blessed One, what is the name of this magical power?”
“Maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:80,id:UT22084-001-006-7908,folio:F.7.a,volume:V2}}} it is called manojavā (“swift as thought”).”

If I had known, I would never have turned my mind from the goal of complete and supreme awakening, even if my body had broken into pieces like grains of sesame. Now I am like firewood that has burned out, and I have no more opportunity.”
{{milestone:{label:2.343,id:UT22084-001-006-744}}}All the monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “Honored One, what karma did the venerable Pūrṇa create that matured to cause his birth in a family that was rich and had great wealth and many possessions? What karma did he create, because of which he was born from a female slave’s womb, went forth, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat?”
{{milestone:{label:2.344,id:UT22084-001-006-745}}}“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the monk Pūrṇa himself, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach him like a flood, inevitably. Who else but Pūrṇa would experience the actions that he himself performed and accumulated? Monks, actions performed and accumulated do not mature in the earth element, the water element, the fire element, or the wind element, which are outside the body. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated like this mature in the aggregates, elements, and sense spheres.

“ ‘I do,’ said the monk. ‘You and I went forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa.’
{{milestone:{label:2.350,id:UT22084-001-006-752}}}“ ‘That is true,” said the arhat, ‘but I have finished what should be done by a mendicant.

{{milestone:{label:2,id:UT22084-001-006-chapter-2-6-1}}}A. The Story of the Two Nāga Kings and King Bimbisāra{{note:{index108,id:UT22084-001-006-758}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.355,id:UT22084-001-006-759}}}The following took place in Rājagṛha.
{{milestone:{label:2.356,id:UT22084-001-006-760}}}At that time, there lived in Rājagṛha two nāga kings named Valguka and Giri. Because of their power, five hundred hot springs were always flowing, the fountains, lakes, and ponds never dried up, and the gods brought rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, the harvest was exceedingly abundant.
{{milestone:{label:2.357,id:UT22084-001-006-761}}}After the Blessed One had converted the two nāga kings Nanda and Upananda,{{note:{index109,id:UT22084-001-006-762}}} they both came every day from the terrace of Mount Sumeru to serve the Blessed One. The nāga kings Valguka and Giri thought, “While these nāga kings Nanda and Upananda come every day from the terrace of Mount Sumeru to serve the Blessed One, it is not good that we, living in this very place, do not serve the Blessed One. Therefore, let us serve the Blessed One, too.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.358,id:UT22084-001-006-763}}}They went to the Blessed One, and when they had arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, {{page:{number:83,id:UT22084-001-006-7911,folio:F.8.b,volume:V2}}} the Blessed One preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. After they had heard the Dharma, they sought refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha and accepted the rules of training. Once they had sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, their bodies and the amount of food they needed for their bodies greatly increased. They both went to the Blessed One, and when they had arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Blessed One, and said, “Blessed One, when we sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, our bodies and the amount of food we needed for our bodies greatly increased. Blessed One, if the Blessed One would authorize it, we will enter the great ocean.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.359,id:UT22084-001-006-764}}}“Lords of nāgas,” replied the Blessed One, “since you are living in the land of the king, ask the king for permission.”
The two considered this and stayed there, saying, “The Blessed One means that he does not give us permission.”
{{milestone:{label:2.360,id:UT22084-001-006-766}}}The nāga kings Valguka and Giri were always dressed as gods if they went to see the Blessed One at night, and as householders if they went by day. Dressed as householders, they both served the Blessed One every day.
{{milestone:{label:2.361,id:UT22084-001-006-767}}}Whenever King Bimbisāra went to see the Blessed One, the king, who was proud of his status as a kṣatriya, always sent his retainer ahead, saying, “There must not be anyone who does not stand up when he sees me.” Once, he sent a retainer, saying, “Hey, go and see who is serving the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:2.362,id:UT22084-001-006-768}}}The retainer went and saw two householders. He thought, “Since these two people are living in the land of His Majesty, why would they not stand up at the sight of His Majesty?” {{page:{number:84,id:UT22084-001-006-7912,folio:F.9.a,volume:V2}}} He said to the king, “Your Majesty, there are two householders, and they are living in the very land of Your Majesty.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.363,id:UT22084-001-006-769}}}King Bimbisāra thought, “Why would those two people not stand up at the sight of me? Therefore, I shall go.” Then he went to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:2.364,id:UT22084-001-006-770}}}When the nāga kings Valguka and Giri saw King Bimbisāra, they asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if King Bimbisāra comes, to which should we show respect, the king or the Dharma?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.365,id:UT22084-001-006-771}}}“Nāga kings, show respect to the Dharma,” replied the Blessed One. “Thus the buddhas, the blessed ones, also respected the true Dharma. The arhats also respected the Dharma.” He then spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:2.366,id:UT22084-001-006-772}}}“Those who were past buddhas, 
Those who will be future buddhas,
And he who is the present Buddha 
Conquer many sorrows.
{{milestone:{label:2.367,id:UT22084-001-006-773}}}“Those who have passed, those who will come, and he who is present 
All respect the true Dharma. 
This is the rule of the buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:2.368,id:UT22084-001-006-774}}}“Therefore, anyone here who wishes for their own benefit, 
Who wishes for a great state for themselves,
Should remember the teachings of the Buddha 
And show respect to the true Dharma.”{{note:{index110,id:UT22084-001-006-775}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.369,id:UT22084-001-006-776}}}The two did not stand up, and the king found this unbearable. He requested, “May the Blessed One preach the Dharma.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.370,id:UT22084-001-006-777}}}The Blessed One spoke these verses:
“With thoughts of anger, confusion, 
And impiety
You cannot understand the true Dharma 
Preached by the Perfectly Awakened One.
{{milestone:{label:2.371,id:UT22084-001-006-779}}}“One who has controlled his thoughts 
Of wrath and carelessness,
And abandoned thoughts of torment here,
Can understand what is well preached.”{{note:{index111,id:UT22084-001-006-780}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.372,id:UT22084-001-006-781}}}The king thought, “Because these two householders came, the Blessed One {{page:{number:85,id:UT22084-001-006-7913,folio:F.9.b,volume:V2}}} interrupted my hearing of the Dharma.” He rose from his seat, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed. When he had departed, he instructed his ministers, “Sirs, when those two householders depart from the presence of the Blessed One, order them both to leave my land.”
{{milestone:{label:2.373,id:UT22084-001-006-782}}}When they had both bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s two feet and departed, the ministers ordered them, “This was uttered from His Majesty’s lips: ‘You two must not live in my land.’ ”
“Certainly,” they both answered.
{{milestone:{label:2.374,id:UT22084-001-006-784}}}The nāga kings then thought, “We both obtained without difficulty the very thing for which we had long hoped.” They then caused a great flood and entered a small valley. Then from the small valley they entered a large valley, from the large valley a small river, from the small river a large river, and from the large river the great ocean. When they entered the great ocean, their bodies and the amount of food they needed for their bodies again greatly increased.
{{milestone:{label:2.375,id:UT22084-001-006-785}}}Later, the five hundred hot springs and the fountains, lakes, and ponds in Rājagṛha became smaller, depleted, and dried up, and the gods did not bring rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, there was a very poor harvest, a famine, and fear, and it was difficult for beggars in the wilderness to find food. The king thought, “In this Rājagṛha there once lived the nāga kings Giri and Valguka. Thanks to their power, five hundred hot springs were always flowing, the fountains, lakes, and ponds never dried up, the gods brought rain at the appropriate times, and therefore the harvest was abundant. But now the five hundred hot springs, fountains, lakes, and ponds have become smaller, depleted, and dried up, {{page:{number:86,id:UT22084-001-006-7914,folio:F.10.a,volume:V2}}} and the gods have not brought rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, there has been a very poor harvest, a famine, and fear, and it is difficult for beggars in the wilderness to find food. Did the nāga kings Giri and Valguka die? Were they taken away by the king of birds, the garuḍa? Were they captured by a snake charmer? Perhaps they have run away frightened. Still, since the Buddha, the Blessed One, is omniscient, one who sees everything, I shall now ask the Blessed One this question.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.376,id:UT22084-001-006-786}}}He went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, King Bimbisāra explained the matter in detail to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:2.377,id:UT22084-001-006-787}}}“Great King,” said the Blessed One, “neither has died, nor have they been taken away by the king of birds, the garuḍa, nor been captured by a snake charmer, and they have not run away frightened. But you yourself, who are the king, banished them from your land.”
{{milestone:{label:2.378,id:UT22084-001-006-788}}}“Blessed One, I have never seen either of them, let alone banished them from my land.”
“Great King, I will remind you. Great King, do you remember banishing two householders from your land?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.379,id:UT22084-001-006-790}}}“Blessed One, I remember that.”
“Those two people were the nāga kings Giri and Valguka.”
{{milestone:{label:2.380,id:UT22084-001-006-792}}}“Honored One, where are they now?”
“They have gone to the great ocean.”
{{milestone:{label:2.381,id:UT22084-001-006-794}}}“My land will be ruined!”
“Great King, beg the two of them for forgiveness,{{note:{index112,id:UT22084-001-006-796}}} and your land will not be ruined.”
{{milestone:{label:2.382,id:UT22084-001-006-797}}}“How should I beg them for forgiveness when they are in the great ocean?”
“On the eighth and fourteenth days of the month,{{note:{index113,id:UT22084-001-006-799}}} they both come dressed as householders to bow low until their foreheads touch my feet. At that time, I will make a sign. Then you should beg them for forgiveness.”
{{milestone:{label:2.383,id:UT22084-001-006-800}}}“Blessed One, should I throw myself at their feet, {{page:{number:87,id:UT22084-001-006-7915,folio:F.10.b,volume:V2}}} or should I not throw myself at their feet?”
“No, reach out your hand and say, ‘O nāga kings, forgive me,’ and you will be forgiven.”
{{milestone:{label:2.384,id:UT22084-001-006-802}}}The king was sitting patiently when the two nāga kings arrived. Just as they both came dressed as householders into the presence of the Blessed One, the king also came. And when the Blessed One made a sign, the king reached out his hand and said, “O you two nāga kings, please forgive me.”
{{milestone:{label:2.385,id:UT22084-001-006-803}}}“Great King, you are forgiven.”
“If I am forgiven, please return.”
{{milestone:{label:2.386,id:UT22084-001-006-805}}}“Great King, since we sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, our bodies and the amount of food we need for our bodies have increased. If we come here with our present body size, even the whole country of Magadha would not be able to accommodate us.”
{{milestone:{label:2.387,id:UT22084-001-006-806}}}“Then the country of Magadha will be ruined!”
“It will not be ruined.”
{{milestone:{label:2.388,id:UT22084-001-006-808}}}“Why will it not?”
“Have two palaces built for us and offer worship every six months, and we will make our attendants stay there and gather together at the time of worship.”
{{milestone:{label:2.389,id:UT22084-001-006-810}}}The king did as he had been told. The two nāga kings made their attendants stay there, and the nāga kings received his worship themselves.
{{milestone:{label:2,id:UT22084-001-006-chapter-2-6-2}}}B. The Quarrel between the Brahmin Agnidatta and the Citizens of Rājagṛha{{note:{index114,id:UT22084-001-006-812}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.390,id:UT22084-001-006-813}}}Later, when their attendants were living in idleness, wicked nāgas took the opportunity to cause hail. In Rājagṛha, there was a brahmin who was familiar with a charm against hail, and he stopped the hail each time. The people living in the country of Magadha gave him an allotment.
{{milestone:{label:2.391,id:UT22084-001-006-814}}}There was another brahmin named Agnidatta in the southern region who was also familiar with a charm against hail. He heard that there was a country in the northern region named Powerful over which a king named Best Army ruled, that there was the residence of a nāga king named Sundara in that country, {{page:{number:88,id:UT22084-001-006-7916,folio:F.11.a,volume:V2}}} and that there was a medicine that had great potency and surpassed any other medicine. He decided to go there in order to get the medicine. He departed and in due course he arrived at Rājagṛha, where he stayed in the residence of the first brahmin who had the charm against hail. Then, when it hailed a lot, the brahmin who had originally lived there was unable to stop the hail and, at a loss, was going in and out of the house again and again. The brahmin Agnidatta asked him,{{note:{index115,id:UT22084-001-006-815}}} “Sir, why are you going in and out of the house again and again?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.392,id:UT22084-001-006-816}}}“Because I cannot stop the great hail, my son,” said the first brahmin.
“I shall stop it.”
“That would be good, my son.”
{{milestone:{label:2.393,id:UT22084-001-006-819}}}Agnidatta placed a spell on some water and sprinkled the water, whereupon the cloud broke into a hundred pieces and dispersed. The brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha were very surprised and went to the brahmin’s house, bringing gifts. “Sir,” they said, “the people in Rājagṛha are rejoicing. Please accept our gifts.”
{{milestone:{label:2.394,id:UT22084-001-006-820}}}“Why?”
“Because you stopped the great hail.”
{{milestone:{label:2.395,id:UT22084-001-006-822}}}“I did not stop the hail,” he told them, “this brahmin did.”
They went to the brahmin Agnidatta and said, “O young brahmin, please remain here and we shall give you an allotment.”
{{milestone:{label:2.396,id:UT22084-001-006-824}}}“In that case, I shall live here.” 
So, he lived there. He stopped the hail with the charm and for a while it never hailed. The brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha said to each other, “Sirs, since it does not hail thanks to our own merits, why should we give him an allotment?” They stopped giving the allotment. 
{{milestone:{label:2.397,id:UT22084-001-006-826}}}The brahmin Agnidatta then stopped using his charm and went to the country of Powerful, and later it started to hail again. The people went to the brahmin who had originally lived there and asked him, “Sir, where is the young brahmin?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.398,id:UT22084-001-006-828}}}He replied, “Since you did not treat him with respect, he has left.”
“Sir, if he comes back, please let us know.”
“I shall do so.”
{{milestone:{label:2.399,id:UT22084-001-006-830}}}Agnidatta went in due course to King Best Army. Upon his arrival, he wished King Best Army victory {{page:{number:89,id:UT22084-001-006-7917,folio:F.11.b,volume:V2}}} and long life and said, “Your Majesty, there is a nāga king named Sundara in your land, and there is a medicine named immediate effect in his residence. Your Majesty, please tell me where he is, and I will offer you a portion of the medicine.”
{{milestone:{label:2.400,id:UT22084-001-006-831}}}“O brahmin,” said the king, “since the nāga king Sundara is fierce, he will certainly defeat you.”
“Your Majesty, for the time being I have the power of a charm and the power of medicine. If the continent of Jambu were to be filled with nāgas like the nāga king Sundara as densely as a thicket of sugarcane or a thicket of reeds, a single hair of mine would not be moved by the nāgas, much less so by the nāga king Sundara alone. By the way, is there any citizen of Your Majesty who is to be executed?”
{{milestone:{label:2.401,id:UT22084-001-006-833}}}“Yes, there is, brahmin.”
“Your Majesty, please summon him here and make him tell me where the residence of the nāga king is.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.402,id:UT22084-001-006-835}}}The king then summoned the man and ordered him, “Hey, tell this brahmin where the residence of the nāga king Sundara is.”
{{milestone:{label:2.403,id:UT22084-001-006-836}}}“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to the king, and he departed, guiding the brahmin. Then, after having traveled for some distance, the man halted and said to the brahmin, “Brahmin, do you see that green forest rising up over there?”
{{milestone:{label:2.404,id:UT22084-001-006-837}}}“Yes, I do.”
“That is the residence of the nāga king Sundara.”
{{milestone:{label:2.405,id:UT22084-001-006-839}}}Agnidatta went there and bound the medicine called immediate effect in a bundle, brought it to the country of Powerful, and gave King Best Army his portion of the medicine. He arrived in due course at Rājagṛha and stayed at the house of the original brahmin. Then, when the brahmin had called together the brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha, they brought offerings and said, “O young brahmin, please remain here. We shall give you an allotment.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.406,id:UT22084-001-006-840}}}Agnidatta replied, “Since you did not treat me with respect, I will not remain.” 
They started to insist that he stay, entreated him, made a promise, and provided him with sustenance. 
{{milestone:{label:2.407,id:UT22084-001-006-842}}}Since people in the world desire prosperity and abhor decline, Agnidatta {{page:{number:90,id:UT22084-001-006-7918,folio:F.12.a,volume:V2}}} took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a boy was born, and Agnidatta named his son Mountain. When the couple again played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, a girl was born, and Agnidatta named his daughter Hail. The name of the brahmin’s wife was Free from the Cycle. The name of his son’s wife was Lightning.{{note:{index116,id:UT22084-001-006-843}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.408,id:UT22084-001-006-844}}}Agnidatta thought, “What is the use of my stopping the hail each and every time? I will use a charm to block it for a long time.” Because he used a charm to block the hail for a long time, it did not hail. 
{{milestone:{label:2.409,id:UT22084-001-006-845}}}The brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha said to each other, “Sirs, since it does not hail thanks to our own merits, why should we give him an allotment?” They stopped giving the allotment. The brahmin, out of jealousy, had not taught the words of the charm even to his son, and, attached to his life of ease, he had neither recited the charm nor kept the medicine dry, whereupon he forgot the words of the charm and found the medicine rotten because it had not been dried.
{{milestone:{label:2.410,id:UT22084-001-006-846}}}Agnidatta, who had once trusted the brahmins and the householders in Rājagṛha but again began to quarrel with them, visited the residences of non-Buddhist ascetics and the forests of ascetics here and there and asked them, “Sirs, is there any means to attain all that I want and seek?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.411,id:UT22084-001-006-847}}}On those occasions, one said, “Enter into a fire”; another one said, “Take poison”; another one said, “Throw yourself from a cliff”; and another one said, “Tie a rope around your neck and hang yourself from the bough of a tree.” All of them thus taught a means of death, not a means of going forth. 
{{milestone:{label:2.412,id:UT22084-001-006-848}}}He went to the Bamboo Grove and saw a monk {{page:{number:91,id:UT22084-001-006-7919,folio:F.12.b,volume:V2}}} and asked him, “Noble one, is there any means to attain all that I want and seek?” 
“Go forth in the presence of the Blessed One,” said the monk.
{{milestone:{label:2.413,id:UT22084-001-006-850}}}“What will I do there?”
“You should, throughout your life, lead the pure life and be engaged in dhyāna and recitation. If you attain omniscience in this present life, you will have arrived at the end of your suffering. On the other hand, should you die with your fetters remaining, you will attain all that you want and seek.”
{{milestone:{label:2.414,id:UT22084-001-006-852}}}“Noble one, if I cannot do that, is there any other means?”
“Invite the community of monks headed by the Buddha and offer a meal.”
{{milestone:{label:2.415,id:UT22084-001-006-854}}}“Please tell me another way in case I cannot do that either.”
“Invite the four great disciples who are like a wish-fulfilling vase,{{note:{index117,id:UT22084-001-006-856}}} offer them a meal, and make an aspiration, and you will attain all that you want and seek.”
{{milestone:{label:2.416,id:UT22084-001-006-857}}}“Noble one, I can do that. I will.”
He invited the four great disciples who are like a wish-fulfilling vase, offered them a meal, and made this aspiration: “May this root of merit cause Sundara to die and disappear from the state of a nāga and allow me be born there, and after that do harm to the people of Rājagṛha!”{{note:{index118,id:UT22084-001-006-859}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.417,id:UT22084-001-006-860}}}His wife asked him, “My dear, what aspiration did you make?”
“I made an aspiration that this root of merit might cause Sundara to die and disappear from the state of a nāga and allow me to be born there, and after that do harm to the people of Rājagṛha.”
{{milestone:{label:2.418,id:UT22084-001-006-862}}}“Good. May I become your wife when you get your wish!” 
His son said, “May I become your son, too!” 
{{milestone:{label:2.419,id:UT22084-001-006-864}}}His daughter said likewise, “May I become your daughter, too!” 
And his son’s wife said likewise, “May I become your son’s wife, too!”
{{milestone:{label:2.420,id:UT22084-001-006-866}}}When they entered an old house {{page:{number:92,id:UT22084-001-006-7920,folio:F.13.a,volume:V2}}} and slept, rain fell from a cloud of five colors, and they were all killed, crushed by a falling wall. After the nāga Sundara had died, they were born there with sixty thousand attendant nāgas. The nāga who had been Agnidatta in his former life then became known as Sundara, too. His wife’s name became Free from the Cycle, his son’s name Mountain, his daughter’s name Hail, and his son’s wife’s name Lightning.
{{milestone:{label:2.421,id:UT22084-001-006-867}}}It is natural that male nāgas and female nāgas remember three things just after birth: where they died, where they were reborn, and by what action. The nāga observed that he had died in the human world. Where was he born? In the midst of nāgas. By what karma? By the force of an aspiration. For what purpose? For the purpose of doing harm to the people in Rājagṛha. 
{{milestone:{label:2.422,id:UT22084-001-006-868}}}He asked himself, “Which causes greater suffering to people, doing harm to crops that have just sprung up, or to crops that have not yet sprung up?” He saw that doing harm to crops that have not yet sprung up would do less damage than doing harm to crops that have just sprung up. He ordered his attendants, “Sirs, now cause all the crops in the country of Magadha to grow with rain today.” They caused all the crops to grow. Then he, with his sixty thousand attendants, caused rain as thick as the shafts of a plough, which looked as if it would carry away everything down to the last straw. Because of this, the people said to each other, “This nāga carried away even the straw.” The nāga’s name thus became Apalāla (Without a Straw).

{{milestone:{label:3.2,id:UT22084-001-006-878}}}The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once staying in Kalandaka­nivāpa Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha.
{{milestone:{label:3.3,id:UT22084-001-006-879}}}When Prince Ajātaśatru was enticed by Devadatta to kill his own father, who was a righteous Dharma king, and crown himself king, he began to perform a number of disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One {{page:{number:93,id:UT22084-001-006-7921,folio:F.13.b,volume:V2}}} and set the elephant Dhanapālaka{{note:{index122,id:UT22084-001-006-880}}} and a fierce dog on the Blessed One in order to kill him. 
{{milestone:{label:3.4,id:UT22084-001-006-881}}}His mother, Vaidehī, told him, “My son, do not perform disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, are concerned about disrespectful acts, the Blessed One will leave Rājagṛha, which is bound to be a loss for us. Thanks to the Blessed One’s power, the people of the countries of Aṅga and Magadha have been rich and enjoyed themselves.”{{note:{index123,id:UT22084-001-006-882}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.5,id:UT22084-001-006-883}}}In an agitated state of mind, he replied, “Will a country where the Blessed One is not staying become ruined and uninhabited?” All his mother’s attempts to stop him were in vain. 
{{milestone:{label:3.6,id:UT22084-001-006-884}}}The Blessed One thought, “Since this Prince Ajātaśatru has performed a number of nonmeritorious acts, now is not a good time for me to establish him in rootless faith.{{note:{index124,id:UT22084-001-006-885}}} Therefore I shall go to Śrāvastī.” Thereupon the Blessed One, with the community of disciples, traveled toward Śrāvastī. In due course, he arrived in Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:3.7,id:UT22084-001-006-886}}}Neighboring minor kings heard that since Ajātaśatru had performed disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One, the Blessed One had become concerned about such disrespectful acts, left Rājagṛha, and arrived in Śrāvastī. They thought, “For the time being, that sinful king, after having killed his father who was a righteous Dharma king, is not content and has performed disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One, who is venerated by gods, asuras, and humans. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, are concerned about disrespectful acts, the Blessed One left Rājagṛha and arrived in Śrāvastī. Therefore, by whatever means, we shall dethrone him.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.8,id:UT22084-001-006-887}}}They sent messengers to each other and unified their efforts, prepared an army consisting of four divisions, and set off for Rājagṛha with an elephant division, {{page:{number:94,id:UT22084-001-006-7922,folio:F.14.a,volume:V2}}} a horse division, a chariot division, and an infantry division. They damaged the crops and camped around the city.
{{milestone:{label:3.9,id:UT22084-001-006-888}}}The nāga king Apalāla also damaged other crops by causing hail. Because the five hundred hot springs, fountains, lakes, and ponds had dried up, there was a famine. The rest of the water supply was polluted with poison by the neighboring minor kings. Then, as if throwing ash on the wound of Ajātaśatru, who could not bear his pain and was frightened, nonhuman beings took the opportunity to cause an epidemic, and then funeral biers jostled with one another. King Ajātaśatru, his mind confused by the hundreds of losses, was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand. Vaidehī asked him, “My son, why are you plunged into grief?”
{{milestone:{label:3.10,id:UT22084-001-006-889}}}“Mother, I have suffered hundreds of losses.”
“My son, did I not once tell you, ‘Do not perform disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One.  Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, are concerned about disrespectful acts, the Blessed One will leave Rājagṛha, which is bound to be a loss for us’? That’s why!”
{{milestone:{label:3.11,id:UT22084-001-006-891}}}“Mother, what should I do about it?”
“My son, beg the Blessed One for forgiveness.”
{{milestone:{label:3.12,id:UT22084-001-006-893}}}“Mother, I cannot go into the presence of the Blessed One.”
“My son, have you not heard that the buddhas, the blessed ones, accept being cut by an adze and being anointed with sandal paste as the same, and have abandoned anger and attachment? If one cut the Blessed One’s arm with an adze and anointed his other arm with gośīrṣacandana, the Blessed One would feel neither attachment nor anger toward him.”
{{milestone:{label:3.13,id:UT22084-001-006-895}}}Then King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, {{page:{number:95,id:UT22084-001-006-7923,folio:F.14.b,volume:V2}}} ordered a man, “Go now to the Blessed One. When you arrive, bow low on my behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. Then say, ‘Honored One, this is a message from Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī: “Honored One, though there is a bad son, there is no bad father. So, may the Blessed One have compassion and come to Rājagṛha. If the Blessed One does not come, the city of Rājagṛha will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.” ’ ”
“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, and departed. 
{{milestone:{label:3.14,id:UT22084-001-006-897}}}The man in due course arrived in Śrāvastī and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the man said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, bows low until his forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and asks if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness . . . and living in vigor and comfort.”
“I hope you and Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, are living in comfort, too.”
{{milestone:{label:3.15,id:UT22084-001-006-899}}}“Honored One, this is a message from Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī: ‘Honored One, though there is a bad son, there is no bad father. So, may the Blessed One have compassion and come to Rājagṛha. If the Blessed One does not come, the city of Rājagṛha will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:3.16,id:UT22084-001-006-900}}}The Blessed One assented to the man by remaining silent. Then the man, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, {{page:{number:96,id:UT22084-001-006-7924,folio:F.15.a,volume:V2}}} departed from the Blessed One’s presence.
{{milestone:{label:3.17,id:UT22084-001-006-901}}}Thereafter the Blessed One stayed in Śrāvastī as long as he wished, and then traveled toward Rājagṛha with the community of disciples. In due course, he arrived in the country of Magadha.
{{milestone:{label:3.18,id:UT22084-001-006-902}}}By the power of the Blessed One, the gods who send wind dried up the waters that had been polluted with poison. The gods who bring rain filled the land with water of the eight good qualities. The gods brought rain. The gods who have faith in the Buddha expelled the nonhuman beings from Rājagṛha and the epidemic ceased. When the neighboring minor kings heard that the Blessed One had come, they ended their siege of the city and left. Merchants displayed their merchandise. Each craftsman began to work. Merchants and caravan leaders living in each country began to enter Rājagṛha bringing their merchandise. The harvest became abundant. The great state of the Blessed One was proclaimed in wide streets, in small streets, at three-forked roads, and at crossroads. Non-Buddhist ascetics became timid. People were very pleased.
{{milestone:{label:3.19,id:UT22084-001-006-903}}}When Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, heard that the Blessed One had come to the country of Magadha, he was pleased, he rejoiced, he was very pleased, he was highly pleased, and he felt happy. He instructed his ministers, “Sirs, today decorate the road for three and a half yojanas and beautify the cities for the sake of the Blessed One. In the whole city of Rājagṛha, remove the stones, pebbles, and gravel, sprinkle sandalwood water, and hang many silk tassels. Set out sweet-smelling censers {{page:{number:97,id:UT22084-001-006-7925,folio:F.15.b,volume:V2}}} and set up parasols and banners. At various intervals make beautiful houses of flowers.”
{{milestone:{label:3.20,id:UT22084-001-006-904}}}“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the ministers to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, and they completed everything thoroughly. 
{{milestone:{label:3.21,id:UT22084-001-006-905}}}Then Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, with the majesty of a great king and the power of a great king, went to meet the Blessed One by himself along with his army of four divisions.
{{milestone:{label:3.22,id:UT22084-001-006-906}}}Then the Blessed One,{{note:{index125,id:UT22084-001-006-907}}} who was self-controlled and followed by a self-controlled assembly, who was calm and followed by a calm assembly, who was peaceful and followed by a peaceful assembly, who was excellently self-controlled and followed by an excellently self-controlled assembly, who was an arhat and followed by an assembly of arhats, who was free from desire and followed by an assembly free from desire, who was beautiful and followed by a beautiful assembly, like a bull surrounded by bullocks, like an elephant surrounded by young elephants, like a lion surrounded by a pride of beasts, like a king of haṃsas surrounded by a flock of haṃsas, like a garuḍa surrounded by a flock of birds, like a brahmin surrounded by a group of his disciples, like an excellent physician surrounded by a group of patients, like a hero surrounded by a group of soldiers, like a guide surrounded by a group of visitors, like a caravan leader surrounded by a group of merchants, like a guild head surrounded by his kinsmen, like a minor king surrounded by a group of his ministers, like a wheel-turning king surrounded by his thousand sons, like the moon surrounded by the group of lunar mansions, like the sun surrounded by a thousand lights, like Dhṛtarāṣṭra surrounded by a group of gandharvas, like Virūḍhaka surrounded by a group of kumbhāṇḍas, like Virūpākṣa surrounded by a group of nāgas, like Vaiśravaṇa surrounded by a group of yakṣas, like Vemacitra surrounded by a group of asuras, like Śakra surrounded by the group of Thirty-Three Gods, {{page:{number:98,id:UT22084-001-006-7926,folio:F.16.a,volume:V2}}} like Brahmā surrounded by a group of gods attendant on Brahmā, like the immovable ocean, like a rain cloud, like the best of elephants free from rutting, exhibiting an undisturbed manner and behavior because his senses were completely restrained, fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with a radiance surpassing a thousand suns, and having the ten powers, four types of self-confidence, three unshared applications of mindfulness, and great compassion, arrived at the city of Rājagṛha followed by a large community of monks, Ajātaśatru the king of Magadha and son of Vaidehī, and hundreds of thousands of gods.
{{milestone:{label:3.23,id:UT22084-001-006-909}}}At the moment the Blessed One entered Rājagṛha and, with a specific intention, placed his right foot on the threshold of the city gate, the great earth quaked in six ways. This great earth quaked, quaked furiously, and quaked absolutely furiously. It roared, roared furiously, and roared absolutely furiously. When the eastern side rose, the western side sank. When the western side rose, the eastern side sank. When the southern side rose, the northern side sank. When the northern side rose, the southern side sank. When the periphery rose, the middle sank. When the middle rose, the periphery sank. This whole world, along with the interstices between the worlds, was illuminated by a huge light. Gods beat drums in the air. Gods in the sky scattered divine flowers such as utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka; agaru powder, tagara powder, and powder from the tamāla leaf; divine mandārava flowers; {{page:{number:99,id:UT22084-001-006-7927,folio:F.16.b,volume:V2}}} and garments. When the Blessed One came to the city, these wonders occurred. In addition, narrow places became wide, low places rose, and high places sank; elephants roared, horses roared, and bulls also roared; various musical instruments in houses sounded of their own accord without being struck; blind people could see, deaf people could hear, mute people could speak, and those who had other imperfect faculties gained the perfection of each faculty; and the drunk became sober, those who had taken poison recovered from the effect of the poison, those who were angry with each other became friendly, pregnant women bore their children safely, those who had been confined in prison were freed, and those who lacked property obtained property.
{{milestone:{label:3.24,id:UT22084-001-006-910}}}Having seen such prosperity, a lay brother spoke this verse:
“In the country where the Lord of the World appears, 
There are no crop failures, epidemics, or external attacks,
The gods bring rain, people make merit, 
And hundreds of wonders occur there.”
{{milestone:{label:3.25,id:UT22084-001-006-912}}}Thereupon the Blessed One entered Rājagṛha and relieved the people. He then left Rājagṛha and entered the Bamboo Grove.
{{milestone:{label:3.26,id:UT22084-001-006-913}}}Then Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, {{page:{number:100,id:UT22084-001-006-7928,folio:F.17.a,volume:V2}}} and was then silent. Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, then praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites for three months, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.”
{{milestone:{label:3.27,id:UT22084-001-006-914}}}The Blessed One gave his assent to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, by remaining silent. Then Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from his seat, and departed. The Blessed One with the community of monks was then provided by Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, with the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, for three months.
{{milestone:{label:3,id:UT22084-001-006-chapter-3-1-2}}}B. The Epidemic in Vaiśālī{{note:{index126,id:UT22084-001-006-916}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.28,id:UT22084-001-006-917}}}After that, the epidemic was eradicated by the gods who had faith in the Buddha; it left Rājagṛha but appeared in a place named Guṃjika. When it entered Vaiśālī, the people of Vaiśālī suffered from the epidemic and funeral biers jostled one another.
{{milestone:{label:3.29,id:UT22084-001-006-918}}}There was a brahmin in Vaiśālī named Tomara, who was the chief priest of the country. In a dream, a god living in Vaiśālī said:
{{milestone:{label:3.30,id:UT22084-001-006-919}}}“If the Blessed One, the supreme tamer of people to be tamed, 
The joy of the lineage of the Śākyans,
Comes to Vaiśālī, {{page:{number:101,id:UT22084-001-006-7929,folio:F.17.b,volume:V2}}}
Harm will cease.”
{{milestone:{label:3.31,id:UT22084-001-006-920}}}After the night had passed, Tomara said to the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī, “Sirs, I dreamed such-and-such a dream.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.32,id:UT22084-001-006-921}}}“Sirs, what should we do about it?” they wondered. “Whom shall we send as a messenger to the Blessed One?” They conferred with each other and said, “This chief priest Tomara is himself capable in everything and he loves us. We shall send him.” They said to him, “Go to the Blessed One. When you have arrived, bow low on our behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and then ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness . . . . Then say, ‘Honored One, this is a message from the people of Vaiśālī: “May the Blessed One come to Vaiśālī. If the Blessed One does not come to Vaiśālī, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ” 
{{milestone:{label:3.33,id:UT22084-001-006-922}}}“Sirs,” he said, “since Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, has sought to do harm to you and been your enemy for many years, I am afraid he may do harm to me.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.34,id:UT22084-001-006-923}}}They answered with this verse:
“Even at a time of war against another country, 
It is said that messengers are not killed.
Needless to say, nobody will kill you, 
Because you are a messenger to the Victor.”
{{milestone:{label:3.35,id:UT22084-001-006-925}}}Thereupon the chief priest Tomara performed various rituals that bring good fortune, blessings, and well-being, and in due course arrived in Rājagṛha. After he was fully rested, he went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, face to face with the Blessed One, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and then sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the chief priest Tomara {{page:{number:102,id:UT22084-001-006-7930,folio:F.18.a,volume:V2}}} said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, the people of Vaiśālī bow low until their foreheads touch the Blessed One’s feet, and ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, having no trouble, and living in vigor and comfort.”
{{milestone:{label:3.36,id:UT22084-001-006-927}}}“Tomara, I hope you and the people of Vaiśālī are living in comfort, too.”
“O Gautama, this is a message from the people of Vaiśālī: ‘May the Blessed One come to Vaiśālī. If the Blessed One does not come to Vaiśālī, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ” 
{{milestone:{label:3.37,id:UT22084-001-006-928}}}“Tomara,” replied the Blessed One, “together with the community of disciples, I am being provided with all the requisites for three months by Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. So, ask the king for permission. If the king permits it, I shall go as you have asked.”
{{milestone:{label:3.38,id:UT22084-001-006-929}}}Tomara sent a message to the people of Vaiśālī that the Blessed One had spoken thus. The people of Vaiśālī returned a message: “Then you should go to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. When you arrive, ask on our behalf if Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, having no trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. Then say this: ‘Your Majesty, please permit the Blessed One to come to Vaiśālī. If Your Majesty does not permit it, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:3.39,id:UT22084-001-006-930}}}Then the chief priest Tomara asked himself, “Should I first contact the king, or his ministers?” {{page:{number:103,id:UT22084-001-006-7931,folio:F.18.b,volume:V2}}} He thought, “Some people say, ‘Do not make contact directly. You should contact those who help you contact the person.’ In short, I should contact the ministers.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.40,id:UT22084-001-006-931}}}And so he did try to contact the ministers. The ministers then inquired of him, “O Chief Priest, for what business have you come?” 
“Sirs,” he replied, “I came to ask His Majesty a favor for the Blessed One. Please help me.” 
“Certainly. Come when we call you,” they said.
{{milestone:{label:3.41,id:UT22084-001-006-934}}}Thereupon they found an appropriate time and called him. The chief priest Tomara then went to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. When he arrived, he wished Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, victory and long life and sat to one side. When he had sat to one side, the chief priest Tomara said to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, “Your Majesty, the people of Vaiśālī ask whether Your Majesty is free from trouble . . . .”
{{milestone:{label:3.42,id:UT22084-001-006-936}}}“Tomara, I hope you and the people of Vaiśālī are living in comfort, too.”
“Your Majesty, this is a message from the people of Vaiśālī: ‘Your Majesty, please permit the Blessed One to come to Vaiśālī. If Your Majesty does not permit it, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’”
{{milestone:{label:3.43,id:UT22084-001-006-937}}}“Tomara,” said the king, “I have long thought, ‘Oh, why shouldn’t the land of Vaiśālī become uninhabited?’ If the land of Vaiśālī becomes uninhabited, it will happen that I obtain without difficulty the very thing for which I have hoped.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.44,id:UT22084-001-006-938}}}When the king had spoken thus, Tomara departed. The ministers {{page:{number:104,id:UT22084-001-006-7932,folio:F.19.a,volume:V2}}} said, “Your Majesty, does the Blessed One abandon any living being?”
“No, sirs, he does not.”
{{milestone:{label:3.45,id:UT22084-001-006-940}}}“Then Your Majesty is performing a disrespectful act toward the Blessed One. Whether Your Majesty permits the Blessed One or not, the Blessed One will go out of compassion for the beings in Vaiśālī.” 
“Sirs, I did not know that,” said the king. “Call Tomara back, then.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.46,id:UT22084-001-006-942}}}They called Tomara back and the king said to him, “Tomara, I promise I will permit the Blessed One to go. I will permit this if the people of Vaiśālī venerate and serve the Blessed One as I do.”
Tomara then sent a message to the people of Vaiśālī: “The king has spoken thus.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.47,id:UT22084-001-006-944}}}The people said, “While the king has venerated and served the Blessed One only by himself, why would we, who are many, not do so?” They sent a message back: “Ask the Blessed One to come, and we will venerate and serve the Blessed One as a noble one more beautifully than the king did.” Tomara then informed the king of this.
{{milestone:{label:3.48,id:UT22084-001-006-945}}}Thereupon Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, I wish to provide the Blessed One together with the community of monks with the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, throughout my life, {{page:{number:105,id:UT22084-001-006-7933,folio:F.19.b,volume:V2}}} but the Blessed One will not permit it out of compassion for other beings. May the Blessed One then assent to my offer of a meal.”
{{milestone:{label:3.49,id:UT22084-001-006-946}}}The Blessed One assented to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, by remaining silent. Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed.
{{milestone:{label:3.50,id:UT22084-001-006-947}}}Thereupon{{note:{index127,id:UT22084-001-006-948}}} Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. The next morning he let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.51,id:UT22084-001-006-949}}}Knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the king held a golden pitcher and asked the Blessed One a favor: “Honored One, the Blessed One has converted a lot of wicked nāgas and wicked yakṣas. Honored One, this nāga king Apalāla has, for a long time, been hostile toward us who are not hostile, adversarial toward us who are not adversarial, and injurious to us who have not been injurious, and he wasted our crops that had just grown. May the Blessed One have compassion and excellently convert the nāga king Apalāla.”{{note:{index128,id:UT22084-001-006-950}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.52,id:UT22084-001-006-951}}}The Blessed One assented to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, by remaining silent. Thereupon the Blessed One assigned the rewards of the offerings to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, and departed. When he arrived at the monastery, the Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda,{{note:{index129,id:UT22084-001-006-952}}} “Ānanda, let us go to convert the nāga king {{page:{number:106,id:UT22084-001-006-7934,folio:F.20.a,volume:V2}}} Apalāla in the northern region.

He was treated with honor, looked up to, esteemed, venerated, and paid homage to as a worthy man. Now, a god who had once been a friend, companion, relative, and relation of the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant thought, “If I say to the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant, {{page:{number:107,id:UT22084-001-006-7935,folio:F.20.b,volume:V2}}} ‘O ṛṣi, lead now the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One,’ he will never listen to me.

How should you know a friend who loves you as much as himself? For the sake of what should you enter into renunciation? How should you attain freedom from illness? O ṛṣi, hold these questions in your mind, and if someone answers them and thereby pleases you, you should lead the pure life in the presence of that person.” He then disappeared from there.

The king had ninety-nine sons. Whenever the king went out, he always took all of his sons along. His consorts thought, ‘Since whenever this king goes out, he always takes all of his sons along, we are as good as sonless even though we do have sons. Now let us make it a rule that if one of us conceives a child, she must not inform the king.’
{{milestone:{label:3.117,id:UT22084-001-006-1048}}}“Later, one of the consorts did conceive a child.

He was well proportioned, pleasant to behold, and attractive, with a golden complexion, his head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and every major limb and minor appendage of his body complete. When he grew up, every consort loved the boy as if he were her own son.

Now a self-awakened one, he thought, ‘Since I must tell those mothers what I have promised to tell them, now I will go and fulfill my former promise.’ Since such great people do not make demonstrations with words but with their bodies, he began to display miracles in their presence, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, causing rain to fall, and causing lightning to strike. Since ordinary people tend to be swiftly attracted by magical powers, they bowed down to his feet like trees that had been cut at the roots and asked, ‘O noble one, have you attained these good qualities?’

Thereupon the women piled up pieces of every kind of fragrant wood. Having piled up all the wood, they cremated his body, poured milk on the fire to put it out, and placed the ashes in a golden urn. They built a stūpa for the ashes in the park, adorned it with their necklaces, bracelets, {{page:{number:122,id:UT22084-001-006-7950,folio:F.28.a,volume:V2}}} and various kinds of ornaments, and hung on it parasols, banners, and flags.

Because of the remains of the action, as a completely awakened one I now had twenty-five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over my head by gods and humans. If I had not attained a number of good qualities like these, I would have become a wheel-turning king another twenty-five hundred times. Therefore, I transferred my merit that would mature later so that it would mature and be enjoyed by my disciples. Even if there should be such a serious famine that a droṇa of rice could only be bought for a droṇa of pearls, my disciples will not lack for almsfood.

At that time, by the force of the figure of the god who had once been the parrot, a vast display of light filled the entire neighborhood of Nādikā.

You have pulled me out from the states of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts, placed me among the gods and humans, caused me to leave the course of rebirth far behind, dried up the ocean of blood and tears, liberated me from the mountain of bones, shut the gate to inferior states of existence, and opened the gate to heaven and liberation. With the vajra of knowledge I have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother.

“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:4.3,id:UT22084-001-006-1368}}}Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Veṇu Village, and he stayed in a śiṃśapā forest to the north of Veṇu Village. At that time a famine broke out, a calamity in which it became difficult for a beggar to find food. The Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, now here a famine has broken out, a calamity in which it has become difficult for a beggar to find food.{{note:{index186,id:UT22084-001-006-1369}}} Therefore, monks, those of you who have any acquaintances, who have any allies, who have any friends in the villages of Vṛji near Vaiśālī, should enter the rainy-season retreat there. {{page:{number:165,id:UT22084-001-006-7993,folio:F.49.b,volume:V2}}} I will enter the rainy-season retreat, too, in this Veṇu Village with my attendant monk, Ānanda.

{{milestone:{label:4.4,id:UT22084-001-006-1370}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the monks to the Blessed One. And so those who had any acquaintances, who had any allies, who had any friends in the villages of Vṛji near Vaiśālī entered the rainy-season retreat there. The Blessed One entered the rainy-season retreat, too, in that Veṇu Village with his attendant monk, Ānanda.
{{milestone:{label:4.5,id:UT22084-001-006-1371}}}During the rainy-season retreat, the Blessed One caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal illness. The Blessed One thought, “I have caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal illness. However, the community of monks is now dispersed. Since it is not appropriate for me to be completely emancipated{{note:{index187,id:UT22084-001-006-1372}}} while the community of monks is dispersed, I will now remove the pain with vigor, will not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and will abide, having accomplished with my body meditation that is free from outward appearances.”
{{milestone:{label:4.6,id:UT22084-001-006-1373}}}Then the Blessed One did remove the pain with vigor, did not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and abided, having accomplished with his body meditation that is free from outward appearances. Thereupon the Blessed One recovered his ability to act and survive.
{{milestone:{label:4.7,id:UT22084-001-006-1374}}}The venerable Ānanda then arose from his seclusion in the evening and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, {{page:{number:166,id:UT22084-001-006-7994,folio:F.50.a,volume:V2}}} “O Honored One, ever since I knew that the Blessed One had caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal illness, my body has lost its bearings, just as if I had taken poison, and I have forgotten the Dharma I had heard. I hope that the Blessed One does not become completely emancipated until he leaves a will for the community of monks.”
{{milestone:{label:4.8,id:UT22084-001-006-1375}}}“Ānanda, if someone thinks, ‘The community of monks is mine. I will teach the community of monks. The community of monks is led by me,’ he would certainly leave a will for the community of monks. However, Ānanda, I never think, ‘The community of monks is mine. I will teach the community of monks. The community of monks is led by me.’ So why would I leave a will for the community of monks? Again, Ānanda, how could the community of monks rely on me? Ānanda, I have taught the Dharma to be practiced always, namely, the four applications of mindfulness, the four right relinquishments, the four bases of magical power, the five faculties and the five powers, the seven limbs of awakening, and the eightfold path of the noble ones.{{note:{index188,id:UT22084-001-006-1376}}}

However, the community of monks is now dispersed. {{page:{number:167,id:UT22084-001-006-7995,folio:F.50.b,volume:V2}}} Since it would not be appropriate for me to be completely emancipated while the community of monks is dispersed, I will now remove the pain with vigor, will not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and will abide, having accomplished with my body meditation that is free from outward appearances.’

“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:4.17,id:UT22084-001-006-1389}}}Then, in a certain place, the Blessed One smiled.{{note:{index192,id:UT22084-001-006-1390}}} It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile, rays of blue, yellow, red, and white light emanate from their mouths. Some of the rays stream downward and some stream upward. 
{{milestone:{label:4.18,id:UT22084-001-006-1391}}}Those rays that stream downward go to the hells of Reviving, {{page:{number:169,id:UT22084-001-006-7997,folio:F.51.b,volume:V2}}} Black Cord, Being Crushed, Scream, Great Scream, Heat, Intense Heat, Incessant, Blisters, Burst Blisters, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Water Lily, Lotus, and Great Lotus. They alight on and cool those in the hot hells and alight on and warm those in the cold hells. Thus, each of the various pains of those beings in hell ceases. When those beings think, “Sirs, have we died here and been reborn elsewhere?” the blessed ones send an emanation to engender their faith. Seeing it, they think, “Sirs, we have not died here and been reborn elsewhere. Each of our various pains ceased on account of the power of this being we have never seen before.” Their minds filled with faith in the emanation, they exhaust the karma that led them to experience the hells and are reborn among gods and humans as vessels for seeing the truths.
{{milestone:{label:4.19,id:UT22084-001-006-1392}}}Those rays that stream upward go to the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-Three Gods, the gods of Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin, the gods attendant on Brahmā, and the gods of Brahma­purohita, Mahābrahman, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, Ābhāsvara, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, Śubhakṛtsna, Anabhraka, Puṇyaprasava, Bṛhatphala, Abṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha. They resonate with the words “impermanent,” “subject to suffering,” {{page:{number:170,id:UT22084-001-006-7998,folio:F.52.a,volume:V2}}} “empty,” and “selfless,” and proclaim these two verses:
{{milestone:{label:4.20,id:UT22084-001-006-1393}}}“Take action! Go forth! 
Apply yourself to the Buddha’s teachings!
As an elephant destroys a house made of reeds,

{{milestone:{label:4.22,id:UT22084-001-006-1395}}}Then the rays of light, after unfurling through the worlds of the great billionfold universe, later return to the Blessed One. The rays disappear into the space behind the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain actions of the past. They disappear into the space in front of the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain the future. They disappear into the soles of his feet when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth in the hells. They disappear into the heels when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as an animal. They disappear into his big toe when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a hungry ghost. They disappear into his knees when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a human. They disappear into his left palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king of power.{{note:{index193,id:UT22084-001-006-1396}}} They disappear into his right palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king. They disappear into his navel when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a god. They disappear into his mouth when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a disciple. They disappear into the circle of hair between his eyebrows when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a self-awakened one. They disappear into the top of his head when the Blessed One intends to explain complete and perfect awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:4.23,id:UT22084-001-006-1397}}}At that time those rays, after circumambulating the Blessed One three times, disappeared into the top of the Blessed One’s head.

The venerable Ānanda saw the Blessed One smile, and having seen that, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause, without condition. What, then, is the cause and condition for the Honored One’s, the Blessed One’s smile?”

Now I will exercise my magical power over the brahmins and householders in Sālā so that after the śramaṇa Gautama has entered Sālā for alms, carrying his washed bowl with him, he will return with his bowl as it is, without getting even a scrap of food.”
{{milestone:{label:4.75,id:UT22084-001-006-1478}}}Thereupon Māra the Evil One exercised his magical power over the brahmins and householders in Sālā so that after the Blessed One entered Sālā for alms, carrying his washed bowl with him, he would return with his bowl as it was, without getting even a scrap of food. Māra the Evil One then transformed himself into a young brahmin, followed the Blessed One, and said, “O śramaṇa, O śramaṇa, did you not even get a scrap of food?”
{{milestone:{label:4.76,id:UT22084-001-006-1479}}}“Ah,” thought the Blessed One, “this one who is coming is Māra the Evil One. He is causing a disturbance.”
Knowing this, he spoke a verse:

Buddhas are difficult to surpass.

“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.
Soon after the Blessed One arrived at the place called Where There Is a Well.
{{milestone:{label:4.83,id:UT22084-001-006-1493}}}In Where There Is a Well, a woman went to the well, carrying with her a rope and pitcher. A man followed her, entirely possessed by passion for her. Since she was also extremely passionate about him, the two of them went to the well together, embracing each other. Her little son also went to the well, following her. Then, preoccupied by the man, she thought, “I will throw the pitcher into the well,” and, tying the rope around her little son’s neck, threw him into the well. The child died.

{{milestone:{label:4.86,id:UT22084-001-006-1500}}}The woman, out of sorrow for her son, threw herself at the feet of the Blessed One. The Blessed One knew her thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her.  When she had heard the Dharma, the woman leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, she spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for me is what has never been done for me by my mother, my father, a king, gods, ancestral spirits, śramaṇas, brahmins, my husband, or my kinsmen or relatives. Relying on a good spiritual friend, the Blessed One, I have shut the gate to inferior states of existence and opened the gate to heaven and liberation; pulled myself out from the states of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts and placed myself among the gods and humans; left the course of rebirth far behind; dried up the ocean of blood and tears; and been liberated the mountain of bones. With the vajra of knowledge I have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.

{{milestone:{label:6.2,id:UT22084-001-006-1610}}}In Icchānaṅgalā, the Blessed One stayed in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest. At one point the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, I will go into seclusion here for three months.{{note:{index239,id:UT22084-001-006-1611}}} No monks should come to me except when someone brings me almsfood or when it is the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days.”
{{milestone:{label:6.3,id:UT22084-001-006-1612}}}And so the Blessed One did go into seclusion there for three months. No monks came to him except when a monk brought him almsfood or when it was the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days. Thereupon the Blessed One, having spent the three months, sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, if non-Buddhist ascetics or wandering mendicants approach you and ask, ‘In what state did the śramaṇa Gautama go into seclusion here for three months?’ you should answer those who ask, ‘He dwelt in breathing in and breathing out.’ 
{{milestone:{label:6.4,id:UT22084-001-006-1613}}}“Why? Monks, I was in seclusion here for three months in the state of being mindful of breathing in and breathing out. Whenever I breathed in, I knew that I was breathing in exactly as I was. Whenever I breathed out, I knew that I was breathing out exactly as I was. While perfectly aware of long and short breaths and the whole body, whenever I breathed in, I knew, while perfectly aware of the whole body, that I was breathing in exactly as I was. While perfectly aware of the whole body, {{page:{number:192,id:UT22084-001-006-8020,folio:F.63.a,volume:V2}}} whenever I breathed out, I knew, while perfectly aware of the whole body, that I was breathing out exactly as I was. Having made supple the bodily formations, whenever I breathed in and, having made supple the bodily formations, I breathed out, I knew that I breathed in and breathed out exactly as I did . . . .{{note:{index240,id:UT22084-001-006-1614}}} I knew, observing cessation, that I breathed out exactly as I did. 
{{milestone:{label:6.5,id:UT22084-001-006-1615}}}“Monks, about this I thought, ‘Since this is a coarse and fabricated state, now I will go beyond that state and abandon it, and abide in subtler and subtler states again and again.’ Having gone beyond that state and abandoned it, I abided in these subtler and subtler states again and again.
{{milestone:{label:6.6,id:UT22084-001-006-1616}}}“Thereupon three gods came to me. When they arrived, one of the gods said, ‘The śramaṇa Gautama is dead.’
“The second god said, ‘He is not dead but dying.’
“The third god said, ‘He is neither dead nor dying; the state of arhats is tranquil like this.’
{{milestone:{label:6.7,id:UT22084-001-006-1619}}}“Monks, suppose one correctly speaks of the state of a noble one, the state of a god, the state of Brahmā, and the state of a practitioner having completed the training, which are the same as the state of the Tathāgata. Practitioners undergoing training enter into that state in order to obtain what they have not obtained, realize what they have not realized, and actualize what they have not actualized. Practitioners having completed the training enter into that state in order to abide in happiness in this present life.

{{milestone:{label:6.9,id:UT22084-001-006-1624}}}The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived in Icchānaṅgalā and stayed in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest near Icchānaṅgalā.{{note:{index243,id:UT22084-001-006-1625}}}
{{milestone:{label:6.10,id:UT22084-001-006-1626}}}At that time a brahmin named Pauṣkarasāri was given tribute along with gifts for brahmins in the form of roots, trees, and water by King Prasenajit of Kosala, and he was enjoying the wealth of the whole of Utkaṭā. There was a disciple of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri named Ambāṣṭha, who was learned and spoke clearly and fluently. He was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred young brahmins, who were also disciples of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri.
{{milestone:{label:6.11,id:UT22084-001-006-1627}}}The brahmin Pauṣkarasāri heard thus: “The śramaṇa Gautama, a son of the Śākyans, one who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, was awakened to complete and supreme awakening. The great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that honorable Gautama are known in all directions. Thus, the Blessed One Gautama is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. Having in this life, by his own supernormal knowledge, actualized {{page:{number:194,id:UT22084-001-006-8022,folio:F.64.a,volume:V2}}} and accomplished awakening, he announced to the world with its gods, Māra, Brahmā, people such as śramaṇas and brahmins, and beings such as gods and humans: ‘My defilements have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ It appears even in the mantras:{{note:{index244,id:UT22084-001-006-1628}}} ‘There are no other ways for a great man possessing those thirty-two marks of a great man besides these two ways: If he lives at home, he becomes a wheel-turning king who conquers the border regions in the four directions, is a righteous Dharma king, and attains the seven treasures. His seven treasures are as follows: the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. He has a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. He conquers the land entirely, as far as the seashore, without risking harm, without violence, without punishment or weapons, but in accordance with the Dharma and impartially. If, however, he goes forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, he will achieve renown in the world as a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one.’ He, the śramaṇa Gautama, having traveled through the country of Kosala, has arrived in Icchānaṅgalā and is staying in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest near Icchānaṅgalā.”
{{milestone:{label:6.12,id:UT22084-001-006-1629}}}When he heard that, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri said to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Ambāṣṭha, did you know? I have heard thus: ‘The śramaṇa Gautama, a son of the Śākyans, one who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes . . . announced: “. . . . The pure life has been lived.” I discovered it in the mantras: {{page:{number:195,id:UT22084-001-006-8023,folio:F.64.b,volume:V2}}} “There are no other ways for a great man possessing those thirty-two marks of a great man besides these two ways: If he lives at home, he becomes a wheel-turning king who conquers the border regions in the four directions, is a righteous Dharma king . . . he will achieve renown in the world . . . .” This very man, having traveled through the country of Kosala, has arrived in Icchānaṅgalā and is staying in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest near Icchānaṅgalā.’ Now, young brahmin, go to the honorable Gautama and confirm for yourself whether the great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that honorable Gautama, which are known in all directions, are true or not, and whether his famous marks are real or not.”
{{milestone:{label:6.13,id:UT22084-001-006-1630}}}The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha accepted the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri’s order. With many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, he left Utkaṭā and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he sat down to one side. Then the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, face to face with the Blessed One, made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and then sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā. While the Blessed One was giving a talk consistent with the Dharma to the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha walked around in his shoes. Haughty {{page:{number:196,id:UT22084-001-006-8024,folio:F.65.a,volume:V2}}} and arrogant, he suddenly started to speak—he did not wait until the Blessed One had finished speaking, and was thinking of talking back.{{note:{index245,id:UT22084-001-006-1631}}}
{{milestone:{label:6.14,id:UT22084-001-006-1632}}}The Blessed One then asked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Young brahmin, do you speak suddenly and in such a way with brahmins who are familiar with the three Vedas?”
“How do you mean, śramaṇa Gautama?”
{{milestone:{label:6.15,id:UT22084-001-006-1634}}}“While the Tathāgata was giving a talk consistent with the Dharma to the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, you were walking around in your shoes. Haughty and arrogant, you suddenly started to speak, did not wait until I had finished speaking, and were thinking of talking back.”
{{milestone:{label:6.16,id:UT22084-001-006-1635}}}“Śramaṇa Gautama, walking brahmins rightly speak with walking brahmins, standing ones with standing ones, sitting ones with sitting ones, reclining ones with reclining ones. As for shaven-headed śramaṇas, friends of darkness, and the unmarried, it is appropriate that I speak suddenly in this way, as I do now with the honorable Gautama.”
{{milestone:{label:6.17,id:UT22084-001-006-1636}}}“Young brahmin, if you have come here seeking something, you, behaving in such a way, are no one but a person who has not properly served. The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha seems not to have properly served teachers.”
{{milestone:{label:6.18,id:UT22084-001-006-1637}}}The Blessed One having rebuked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha with the words “has not properly served,” Ambāṣṭha was then enraged, angry, furious,{{note:{index246,id:UT22084-001-006-1638}}} and displeased. He wanted to talk back to the Blessed One, insult him, and quarrel with him.{{note:{index247,id:UT22084-001-006-1639}}} Thinking, “This will be enough to talk back to the śramaṇa Gautama, insult him, quarrel with him, and teach him a lesson,” he said to the Blessed One, “Hey, Gautama, these Śākyans are menials indeed.{{note:{index248,id:UT22084-001-006-1640}}} Since they come from a family of menials, they do not respect, esteem, and venerate brahmins.”
{{milestone:{label:6.19,id:UT22084-001-006-1642}}}“Young brahmin, what harm did the Śākyans do to you?”
“Gautama, once before, {{page:{number:197,id:UT22084-001-006-8025,folio:F.65.b,volume:V2}}} I went on foot to the city of Kapilavastu on my own business and that of my teacher. There the Śākyan men and women, who were on the terrace, pointed at me. Saying, ‘Oh! It is the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, disciple of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri. It is the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, disciple of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri,’ they pointed at me without respecting, esteeming, or venerating me.”
{{milestone:{label:6.20,id:UT22084-001-006-1643}}}“Young brahmin, even swallows, which are little birds, twitter however they like when they are{{note:{index249,id:UT22084-001-006-1644}}} in their own nests, let alone the Śākyans. Young brahmin, that Kapilavastu is the city of the Śākyans.”
{{milestone:{label:6.21,id:UT22084-001-006-1645}}}“Gautama, the castes are these four: brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, and śūdra. Gautama, these four castes respect, esteem, and venerate brahmins. But these Śākyans are menials indeed. Since they come from a family of menials, they do not respect, esteem, and venerate brahmins.”
{{milestone:{label:6.22,id:UT22084-001-006-1646}}}Then the Blessed One thought, “Ah, this young brahmin Ambāṣṭha excessively criticizes the Śākyans with the word menials, saying, ‘Oh! The Śākyans are menials. Oh! The Śākyans are menials.’ Now I will examine the origin of his family.”
{{milestone:{label:6.23,id:UT22084-001-006-1647}}}The Blessed One then did examine the origin of the family of the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha. He knew that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha was a descendant of a female slave of the Śākyans and that the Śākyans were sons of his masters. The Blessed One then asked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Ambāṣṭha, what is your family?”
“Gautama, it is Kāṇvāyana.”
{{milestone:{label:6.24,id:UT22084-001-006-1649}}}“Young brahmin, here I examined the origin of your family and {{page:{number:198,id:UT22084-001-006-8026,folio:F.66.a,volume:V2}}} found that you were the son of a female slave of the Śākyans.”
{{milestone:{label:6.25,id:UT22084-001-006-1650}}}Then the elder brahmins from Utkaṭā said to the Blessed One, “Hey, Gautama, you should not criticize the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha with the words ‘son of a slave woman.’ Why? The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha is learned and speaks clearly and fluently. The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer the honorable Gautama about this matter, according to the doctrine.”
{{milestone:{label:6.26,id:UT22084-001-006-1651}}}“Brahmins, if you think that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer me according to the doctrine, you should be silent and let the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha answer me about this matter, according to the doctrine. If you do not think that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer me about this matter according to the doctrine, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha should be silent, and you should answer me about this matter, according to the doctrine.”

{{milestone:{label:6.28,id:UT22084-001-006-1653}}}The Blessed One then recounted to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha,{{note:{index250,id:UT22084-001-006-1654}}} “Young brahmin, once there was a king named Ikṣuvāku. King Ikṣuvāku had four sons: Ulkāmukha, Karakarṇī, Hastiniyaṃsa, and Nūpuraka. That King Ikṣuvāku banished them for a certain sin. Each taking a sister along with him, they went to other countries, other lands. In due course they arrived beside the Himalaya, on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī River.{{note:{index251,id:UT22084-001-006-1655}}} Each of them built his hut near the ṛṣi Kapila’s hermitage and married his half sister by a different mother. They had sons and daughters. Later, King Ikṣuvāku remembered these four sons and asked his ministers, ‘Where are my four sons now?’

{{milestone:{label:6.30,id:UT22084-001-006-1658}}}“King Ikṣuvāku then asked the ministers, ‘Hey, leaders, {{page:{number:199,id:UT22084-001-006-8027,folio:F.66.b,volume:V2}}} are my sons able to do that?’
“ ‘Yes, they are, Your Majesty.’
{{milestone:{label:6.31,id:UT22084-001-006-1660}}}“Then King Ikṣuvāku stretched his upper body, raised his right hand, and spoke an inspired utterance: ‘Ah, my sons are able.’
{{milestone:{label:6.32,id:UT22084-001-006-1661}}}“They were renowned as beings with great power. Since the king uttered the words, ‘My sons are able (śākya),’ they were named Śākya. Young brahmin, have you heard that the Śākyans were born from them, their origin is them, and their ancestors are them?”
“Gautama, I have heard that the Śākyans were born from them, their origin is them, and their ancestors are them.”
{{milestone:{label:6.33,id:UT22084-001-006-1663}}}“Young brahmin, there was a female slave of King Ikṣuvāku named Diśikā, who was beautiful, pleasant to behold, and attractive. She lived with a ṛṣi from a mātaṅga family. Since the two lived together, a son was born. As soon as he was born, the son spoke these words: ‘Mother, please wipe me, wash me, and free me from dirty things immediately.’
{{milestone:{label:6.34,id:UT22084-001-006-1664}}}“At that time people called fiends kāṇvāyanas. When, as soon as he was born, the son spoke the words ‘Mother, please wipe me, wash me, and free me from dirty things immediately,’ his mother exclaimed, ‘Ah, a kāṇvāyana is born!’ Thus, he was named Kāṇvāyana. Young brahmin, have you heard that the Kāṇvāyanas were born from him, their origin is him, and their ancestor is him?”
{{milestone:{label:6.35,id:UT22084-001-006-1665}}}Being thus asked, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha remained silent. The Blessed One asked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha a second and a third time, “Young brahmin, have you heard that the Kāṇvāyanas were born from him, their origin is him, and their ancestor is him?”
The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha remained silent a second and a third time.
{{milestone:{label:6.36,id:UT22084-001-006-1667}}}Then the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi raised {{page:{number:200,id:UT22084-001-006-8028,folio:F.67.a,volume:V2}}} a vajra, which was blazing, fully blazing, thoroughly blazing, and blazing like a single tongue of flame, above the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha’s head, thinking, “If the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, having heard the Blessed One ask him three times, does not answer, I will smash his head into seven pieces with this vajra, which is blazing, fully blazing, thoroughly blazing, blazing like a single tongue of flame.”{{note:{index253,id:UT22084-001-006-1668}}}

{{milestone:{label:6.38,id:UT22084-001-006-1670}}}Then the elder brahmins from Utkaṭā thought,{{note:{index254,id:UT22084-001-006-1671}}} “The Honored One Gautama said that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha was the son of a female slave of the Śākyans and the Śākyans were sons of Ambāṣṭha’s masters. If this is true, we will no longer doubt what the honorable Gautama says.”
{{milestone:{label:6.39,id:UT22084-001-006-1672}}}The Blessed One then said to the elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, “You should not excessively criticize the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha with the words ‘son of a slave woman.’ Why? He was at that time a ṛṣi of great magical power and dignity. He punished King Ikṣuvāku for a certain sin. When he was punished with the punishment for a brahmin, King Ikṣuvāku was frightened, terrified, dejected, and, with the hair in all the pores of his body standing on end, held with his left hand his eldest daughter adorned with every ornament and with his right hand a golden pitcher. Although he offered her as wife to the ṛṣi, the ṛṣi did not accept her.”
{{milestone:{label:6.40,id:UT22084-001-006-1673}}}Then, because the Blessed One {{page:{number:201,id:UT22084-001-006-8029,folio:F.67.b,volume:V2}}} had said to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha that he was the son of a female slave, the young brahmin was upset, his shoulders drooping and his head hanging, ashamed, and in despair, and he remained silent.{{note:{index255,id:UT22084-001-006-1674}}}

{{milestone:{label:6.265,id:UT22084-001-006-2052}}}The Blessed One arrived in Rājagṛha.{{note:{index343,id:UT22084-001-006-2053}}} At that time, a wandering mendicant named Pīṭha{{note:{index344,id:UT22084-001-006-2054}}} was staying on the bank of Sumāgadhā{{note:{index345,id:UT22084-001-006-2055}}} Pond. He caught fish with a hook and ate them at night.{{note:{index346,id:UT22084-001-006-2056}}} After dawn, he sat on a small seat placed on another small seat and spoke a verse:
{{milestone:{label:6.266,id:UT22084-001-006-2057}}}“A man who, living with the best Dharma among other Dharmas,
Does not harm any beings will be a monk. 
A man who, with a pacified mind, practices relinquishment, maintains vows,
And is self-controlled is suited to tranquility.”
{{milestone:{label:6.267,id:UT22084-001-006-2058}}}The Blessed One, knowing it was the time to convert the mendicant, went to him {{page:{number:256,id:UT22084-001-006-8084,folio:F.95.a,volume:V2}}} and said:
{{milestone:{label:6.268,id:UT22084-001-006-2059}}}“If you are just like
The one described in the verse,
You are suited to being counted as an excellent one.
But you are not, as regards relinquishment.
{{milestone:{label:6.269,id:UT22084-001-006-2060}}}“First, one who is pacified and self-controlled,
And does not harm any beings,

{{milestone:{label:6.271,id:UT22084-001-006-2063}}}Then the wandering mendicant Pīṭha thought, “My mind was known by the śramaṇa Gautama’s mind,” and he was filled with faith.
{{milestone:{label:6.272,id:UT22084-001-006-2064}}}The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.

{{milestone:{label:6.273,id:UT22084-001-006-2066}}}The monks had seen him sitting on a small seat placed on another small seat. Then a monk heard the Dharma, sitting on a small seat placed on another small seat, but he did not see the truths even though he was already a vessel of the truths. The Blessed One thought, “Why did this monk not see the truths?” He understood that the reason was haughtiness. Then the Blessed One thought, “The fault that occurred in this case was that the monk sat on a small seat placed on another small seat.” 
{{milestone:{label:6.274,id:UT22084-001-006-2067}}}He said, “Therefore, a monk should not sit on a small seat placed on another small seat. If he does so, he becomes guilty of an offense.”

{{milestone:{label:6.275,id:UT22084-001-006-2070}}}Thereupon the Blessed One, having arrived in Nyagrodhikā from Rājagṛha, dressed early in the morning, took his robe and {{page:{number:257,id:UT22084-001-006-8085,folio:F.95.b,volume:V2}}} his bowl, and entered Nyagrodhikā for alms.
{{milestone:{label:6.276,id:UT22084-001-006-2071}}}There was a daughter of a brahmin from Kapilavastu married to a man in Nyagrodhikā. The daughter of the brahmin saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns. As soon as she saw him, she thought, “Though this Blessed One was a son of the lineage of Śākyans, he abandoned the throne of a wheel-turning king and also abandoned many consorts and storehouses full of treasures and went forth. He is now going for alms. If he will accept almsfood from me, I will offer him almsfood.” 
{{milestone:{label:6.277,id:UT22084-001-006-2072}}}The Blessed One, knowing her mind, held out his bowl and said, “Sister, if you will give me almsfood, put it into this bowl.” 
Then great faith arose in her. When she thought, “My mind was known by the Blessed One’s mind,” and offered almsfood to the Blessed One with strong faith, the Blessed One smiled.
{{milestone:{label:6.278,id:UT22084-001-006-2074}}} It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile . . . .{{note:{index350,id:UT22084-001-006-2075}}} Those rays disappeared between his eyebrows.  Then the venerable Ānanda made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said, “The Buddhas . . . do not without cause . . . .” 
{{milestone:{label:6.279,id:UT22084-001-006-2076}}}The Blessed One said, “. . . do not smile . . . . Ānanda, did you see that the daughter of a brahmin, faith having arisen in her, offered me almsfood?”
“Yes, I did, O Honored One.”
{{milestone:{label:6.280,id:UT22084-001-006-2078}}}“Ānanda, by this root of merit, this daughter of a brahmin will transmigrate for thirteen eons, {{page:{number:258,id:UT22084-001-006-8086,folio:F.96.a,volume:V2}}} never being reborn in inferior modes of existence, but being reborn among gods and humans, and she will become a self-awakened one named Supraṇihita in her last life, last birth, last body, last taking up of an identity.”
{{milestone:{label:6.281,id:UT22084-001-006-2079}}}Then there was a loud shout: “The daughter of the brahmin So-and-so offered almsfood to the Blessed One out of faith. The Blessed One predicted her awakening as a self-awakened one!”
{{milestone:{label:6.282,id:UT22084-001-006-2080}}}The husband of that woman was in the wilderness, collecting flowers and firewood. He heard that his wife had offered almsfood to the śramaṇa Gautama and he had predicted her awakening as a self-awakened one. Unable to bear hearing this, he went to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he asked the Blessed One, “O honorable Gautama, did you go to my house?”
“Yes, I did, O brahmin.”
{{milestone:{label:6.283,id:UT22084-001-006-2082}}}“O honorable Gautama, is it true that my wife offered you almsfood and you predicted her awakening as a self-awakened one?”
“It is true, O brahmin.”
{{milestone:{label:6.284,id:UT22084-001-006-2084}}}“O Gautama, you have abandoned the throne of a wheel-turning king and gone forth. Now why did you knowingly speak false words for the sake of just almsfood? Who believes your words that such a small cause leads to such a result?”
{{milestone:{label:6.285,id:UT22084-001-006-2085}}}“O brahmin, let me ask you something in return; you should answer as best you can. O brahmin, what do you think? Have you ever seen any wonder or marvel?”
{{milestone:{label:6.286,id:UT22084-001-006-2086}}}“O Gautama, apart from other wonders and marvels, listen to me first about the wonder and marvel I have seen in this very Nyagrodhikā. O Gautama, there is a large banyan tree (nyagrodha) in the eastern part of this Nyagrodhikā. This village is called Nyagrodhikā after the name of that tree. Under the tree, five hundred chariots can be accommodated without touching each other or being stacked on top of each other.” {{page:{number:259,id:UT22084-001-006-8087,folio:F.96.b,volume:V2}}}
{{milestone:{label:6.287,id:UT22084-001-006-2087}}}“O brahmin, how big was the seed of the banyan tree? As big as a field?”
“No, it was not, O Gautama.”
{{milestone:{label:6.288,id:UT22084-001-006-2089}}}“As big as a mat, a sesame-oil mill, the wheel of a chariot, a cowhide,{{note:{index351,id:UT22084-001-006-2090}}} the fruit of a bilva tree, or the fruit of a kapittha tree?”
“No, it was not, O Gautama. O Gautama, it was at first about one-fourth of a mustard seed.”
{{milestone:{label:6.289,id:UT22084-001-006-2092}}}“O brahmin, who would believe your words that such a small seed has led to such a result, that gigantic tree?”
“O honorable Gautama, believe it or not, I saw it myself. O Gautama, if a fresh, good seed is correctly planted in an undamaged field, the soil of which is soft and sweet,{{note:{index352,id:UT22084-001-006-2094}}} and the gods bring rain at the appropriate times, then this gigantic banyan tree will grow.”
{{milestone:{label:6.290,id:UT22084-001-006-2095}}}The Blessed One then spoke some verses about this subject: 
“O brahmin, as you see
Fields and seeds,
The Tathāgata sees 
Actions ripen.
{{milestone:{label:6.291,id:UT22084-001-006-2097}}}“O brahmin, as you see
The small seed and the very large tree,
O brahmin, I also see
The small seed and its great result.”
{{milestone:{label:6.292,id:UT22084-001-006-2098}}}Then the Blessed One darted his tongue out of his mouth, and it covered his whole face up to his hairline. He said to the brahmin, “O brahmin, what do you think? Does one whose tongue, darting out of his mouth, covers his whole face knowingly speak false words even for the sake of the throne of a wheel-turning king?”
“No, he does not, O Gautama.”
{{milestone:{label:6.293,id:UT22084-001-006-2100}}}The Blessed One then spoke another verse:
“My tongue tells no lie; it has been generated by truthfulness.
How could it speak what is not true?
O brahmin, I am the Tathāgata, ‘truly come,’ {{page:{number:260,id:UT22084-001-006-8088,folio:F.97.a,volume:V2}}}
Because what I say is true. Thus should you understand.” 
{{milestone:{label:6.294,id:UT22084-001-006-2102}}}Then the brahmin had faith. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature . . . .  With the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. “O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.” 
{{milestone:{label:6.295,id:UT22084-001-006-2103}}}Thereupon the brahmin rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed from the Blessed One’s presence.

{{milestone:{label:7.4,id:UT22084-001-006-2119}}}When the Blessed One had said this, the venerable Kimpila remained silent. He remained so when the Blessed One said it a second time and a third time.

{{milestone:{label:7.18,id:UT22084-001-006-2140}}}Then the Blessed One arrived at a hamlet, wherein was the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s uncle, who had gone forth among ṛṣis. Since the Blessed One thought that the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana ought to convert this ṛṣi, he instructed the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, think about your uncle.”
{{milestone:{label:7.19,id:UT22084-001-006-2141}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana to the Blessed One. He knew the time to convert his uncle had come and tried to enter the hermitage of the ṛṣis. 
{{milestone:{label:7.20,id:UT22084-001-006-2142}}}Then the ṛṣi said, “O śramaṇa, stop. You should not enter this hermitage of brahmins.”
“I am a brahmin, too,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:{label:7.21,id:UT22084-001-006-2144}}}The ṛṣi then spoke a verse: 
“O brahmin, you have neither the sacred grass
Nor a ladle for burnt offerings.
You are bald and you do not perform fire offerings.
Why do you say that you are a brahmin?”
{{milestone:{label:7.22,id:UT22084-001-006-2146}}}The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana spoke some verses in reply:
“O brahmin, it is my sacred grass
To know shame; my ladle is my knowledge;
My faith, which is like constantly flowing water,
Is my water jar;
{{milestone:{label:7.23,id:UT22084-001-006-2148}}}“The truth is my fire offering,
I who am well concentrated within.
Correctly restrained and self-controlled,
I burn offerings by day and by night.”
{{milestone:{label:7.24,id:UT22084-001-006-2149}}}“Even if that is so,” said the ṛṣi, “a shaven-headed śramaṇa is not permitted here.”
{{milestone:{label:7.25,id:UT22084-001-006-2150}}}Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana caused a storm. He went near a lake, approached a tree, and sat under it. There lived an attendant of the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda. The nāga thought, “This is the noble one Mahā­maudgalyāyana, whom the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda respect. Now I will make an effort to venerate him.” The nāga left his residence {{page:{number:264,id:UT22084-001-006-8092,folio:F.99.a,volume:V2}}} and sat, encircling the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s body seven times and raising his hood over the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s head.
{{milestone:{label:7.26,id:UT22084-001-006-2151}}}It is commonplace among ṛṣis that if one is not concerned about another’s pain, one ceases being a ṛṣi. Therefore, the ṛṣi thought, “If that mendicant dies in the storm and I cease being a ṛṣi, that would not be appropriate.” He then left the hermitage and tried to find him. He saw the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana and said, “O mendicant, enter our hermitage.”
“O great ṛṣi, did you cease being a ṛṣi?” asked the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:{label:7.27,id:UT22084-001-006-2153}}}The ṛṣi recognized his voice and asked in return, “Are you the noble one Mahā­maudgalyāyana?”
“O ṛṣi, people know me thus.”
{{milestone:{label:7.28,id:UT22084-001-006-2155}}}“O noble one, for what purpose did you come here?”
“I came for the very purpose of your conversion. Now let us go to the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:7.29,id:UT22084-001-006-2157}}}The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana then took his uncle to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the Blessed One, “This is my uncle, who has gone forth among ṛṣis. The Blessed One should preach the Dharma for him.”
{{milestone:{label:7.30,id:UT22084-001-006-2158}}}The Blessed One knew the ṛṣi’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him. Having heard the Dharma, the ṛṣi actualized the fruit of a never-returner. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. {{page:{number:265,id:UT22084-001-006-8093,folio:F.99.b,volume:V2}}} I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:7.31,id:UT22084-001-006-2159}}} The Blessed One ordained him by saying “Come, monk,” . . . .
Because the Tathāgata said “Come,”
His hair fell out and he was clad in his outer robe,
His faculties at once calmed,
And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind.{{note:{index359,id:UT22084-001-006-2161}}}
{{milestone:{label:7.32,id:UT22084-001-006-2162}}}When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had left, the nāga felt lonely and unhappy. He caused various epidemics in the hamlet and, dressed as a ṛṣi, went to the hermitage and dwelled there. Then the people of the hamlet came to the hermitage and said, “O great ṛṣi, such epidemics have befallen us. What should we do?”
“Come and stay in this place,” replied the ṛṣi, “and the epidemics will be quelled.”
{{milestone:{label:7.33,id:UT22084-001-006-2164}}}The people of the hamlet then went to that place and dwelled there. Because the serpent (ahi) had served as an umbrella (chattra) there, the place became famous as Ahicchattra, and devout people built a monastery and provided it with all the requisites.

{{milestone:{label:7.49,id:UT22084-001-006-2193}}}When the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kuru, had arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka and was staying in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, they met together, flocked together, left Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, and went to the Blessed One. Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka. 
{{milestone:{label:7.50,id:UT22084-001-006-2194}}}At that time, a householder’s son named Rāṣṭrapāla was sitting in the assembly. Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, thought, “If I correctly understand the meaning of what the Blessed One has said, it is difficult for laymen, who live at home, to lead the pure life, which is totally pure, unmixed, complete, completely pure, and clean, throughout their lives. Now I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.”
{{milestone:{label:7.51,id:UT22084-001-006-2195}}}After the Blessed One had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, he remained silent. {{page:{number:269,id:UT22084-001-006-8097,folio:F.101.b,volume:V2}}} The brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka then rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. They bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.
{{milestone:{label:7.52,id:UT22084-001-006-2196}}}As soon as the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka had departed, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:7.53,id:UT22084-001-006-2197}}}“O son of a householder, have your parents permitted it?”
“No, they have not, O Honored One.”

“In that case, O Honored One, I will try to gain permission from my parents.”
{{milestone:{label:7.55,id:UT22084-001-006-2201}}}Then Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, praised and was delighted at the words of the Blessed One and went home. When he had arrived, he said to his parents, “Father, Mother, please be informed that I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith.”
{{milestone:{label:7.56,id:UT22084-001-006-2202}}}“Our son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are our only, dear, sweet, darling son, who has never disobeyed us. If you die, we will have to part from you unwillingly. But where would we let you go while you are still alive?”
“Father, Mother, if you permit this right now, that’s fine. But if you do not permit this, I will neither have a meal nor pay obeisance to you from today onward.”
{{milestone:{label:7.57,id:UT22084-001-006-2204}}}Then Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, {{page:{number:270,id:UT22084-001-006-8098,folio:F.102.a,volume:V2}}} fasted for a day. After that, he fasted for two days, for three days—all the way to seven days. Then the parents of Rāṣṭrapāla said to him, “Our son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are delicate,{{note:{index368,id:UT22084-001-006-2205}}} you desire comfort, and you have not known pain. It is difficult to lead the pure life, it is difficult to practice in complete seclusion, it is difficult to rejoice in solitude, and it is unbearable to live in a dwelling in the wilderness, in a forest, or on the outskirts of a town. Stay here, our son Rāṣṭrapāla, and enjoy the objects of desire, give donations, and make merit.”
{{milestone:{label:7.58,id:UT22084-001-006-2206}}}Even when told this, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, remained silent. The parents of Rāṣṭrapāla then asked their relatives for help: “O relatives, make our son Rāṣṭrapāla come to his senses at once.”
{{milestone:{label:7.59,id:UT22084-001-006-2207}}}Then the relatives of Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, went to Rāṣṭrapāla. When they had arrived, they said to him, “Son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are delicate; you desire comfort . . . , and make merit.”
{{milestone:{label:7.60,id:UT22084-001-006-2208}}}Even when told this, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, remained silent. Then the parents of Rāṣṭrapāla asked Rāṣṭrapāla’s friends for help: “O sons, make our son Rāṣṭrapāla come to his senses at once.”
{{milestone:{label:7.61,id:UT22084-001-006-2209}}}Then the friends of Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, said to Rāṣṭrapāla, “Good son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are delicate; you desire comfort . . . , and make merit.”
{{milestone:{label:7.62,id:UT22084-001-006-2210}}}Even when told this, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, remained silent. Then {{page:{number:271,id:UT22084-001-006-8099,folio:F.102.b,volume:V2}}} the friends said to the parents of Rāṣṭrapāla, “Father and mother, what use is there in letting this son Rāṣṭrapāla die? Permit him to go forth. Then, if he rejoices in the pure life, you will be able to see him alive; if he does not rejoice in it, to whom will the son go but to his parents?”
“Sons, if he lets us see him after he has gone forth, we will permit this.”
{{milestone:{label:7.63,id:UT22084-001-006-2212}}}Then the friends said to Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, “Good son Rāṣṭrapāla, be informed that your parents permit this. They say, ‘If our son lets us see him after he has gone forth.’ ”
“Sirs, I will let them see me.”
{{milestone:{label:7.64,id:UT22084-001-006-2214}}}Thereafter Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, having gradually recovered his bodily strength and power, went to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I was given permission by my parents. Therefore, O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:7.65,id:UT22084-001-006-2215}}}Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, went forth and was ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. Then the Blessed One, having let Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, go forth and ordained him, and having stayed in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka as long as he wished, traveled to Śrāvastī. In due course he arrived at Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī. {{page:{number:272,id:UT22084-001-006-8100,folio:F.103.a,volume:V2}}}
{{milestone:{label:7.66,id:UT22084-001-006-2216}}}Ten years after his ordination, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla attained the state of an arhat. Having savored the joy and happiness of liberation, he thought, “Once when I was a layman, I promised my parents to see them after I had gone forth. Now I will carry out my promise.”
{{milestone:{label:7.67,id:UT22084-001-006-2217}}}The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then went to the Blessed One. Upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, once when I was a layman, I promised my parents I would see them. Now I will go to carry out my promise.”
{{milestone:{label:7.68,id:UT22084-001-006-2218}}}Then the Blessed One made his mind penetrate the mind of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. When it had penetrated it, he concentrated his mind on the mind of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, and then he thought, “It is impossible that Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a noble family, will dwell at home again or enjoy the objects of desire by hoarding,” and so he said to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, “Rāṣṭrapāla, go and liberate beings who have not been liberated. Release those who have not been released. Relieve those who have not been relieved. Emancipate those who have not been emancipated.”
{{milestone:{label:7.69,id:UT22084-001-006-2219}}}The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then praised and delighted in the words of the Blessed One. The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.
{{milestone:{label:7.70,id:UT22084-001-006-2220}}}After that night had passed, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Śrāvastī for alms. {{page:{number:273,id:UT22084-001-006-8101,folio:F.103.b,volume:V2}}} He took a meal of alms in Śrāvastī and returned after the meal. He put in order the bedding and the seat he had used and set out for Sthūlakoṣṭhaka. As he traveled, in due course he arrived at Sthūlakoṣṭhaka and stayed in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka.
{{milestone:{label:7.71,id:UT22084-001-006-2221}}}Thereupon the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, after that next night had passed, dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Sthūlakoṣṭhaka for alms. Going for alms in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, in due course he went to his own home. At that time, a barber was arranging the hair and beard of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father in the courtyard, and his father saw the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla standing before the gate. When he saw him, the father scolded him: “You shaven-headed śramaṇa, you have destroyed my family line. You made Rāṣṭrapāla, my only, dear, sweet, darling son, who had never disobeyed me, go forth and then ordained him. You shaven-headed śramaṇa, who is going to give you almsfood?”
{{milestone:{label:7.72,id:UT22084-001-006-2222}}}Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, having gotten no offering but abuse, left his own home before he was chased away. At that time an old woman, who had once been a slave of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, came out the door, carrying spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa in order to throw it away. When the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla saw the old woman, his former slave, he said to her, “Sister, if you are throwing away that spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa, I will eat it. Please put it in this bowl.”
“O noble one, please have it.”
{{milestone:{label:7.73,id:UT22084-001-006-2224}}}Putting the spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa in the bowl, the old woman, his former slave, {{page:{number:274,id:UT22084-001-006-8102,folio:F.104.a,volume:V2}}} then recognized the characteristics of the hands, feet, face, nose, and way of speaking of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. She asked, “Sir, are you Rāṣṭrapāla?”{{note:{index369,id:UT22084-001-006-2225}}}
“Yes, sister. People know me thus.”
{{milestone:{label:7.74,id:UT22084-001-006-2227}}}Then the old woman, his former slave, hurried to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father. When she arrived, she said to him, “Sir, please be informed that your son Rāṣṭrapāla arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka long before, but he would not enter his own home.”
{{milestone:{label:7.75,id:UT22084-001-006-2228}}}Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father, holding his hair with his left hand and wearing nothing but his loincloth, rushed to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. At that time the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla was sitting by the wall and eating the spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa. Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father asked him, “Rāṣṭrapāla, why do you not enter your own home despite having arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka long before? Why are you eating that spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa?”
{{milestone:{label:7.76,id:UT22084-001-006-2229}}}“O householder, when I came to your house, I got no offering but abuse, and had to leave before I was chased away.”
{{milestone:{label:7.77,id:UT22084-001-006-2230}}}“I did not know it was my son Rāṣṭrapāla. If I had known, I would not have said such a thing. My son Rāṣṭrapāla, forgive me.”
“I forgive you, O householder.”
{{milestone:{label:7.78,id:UT22084-001-006-2232}}}Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father firmly embraced him and had him sit on a seat prepared in his own home. The father then said to Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother, “Our son Rāṣṭrapāla has come back {{page:{number:275,id:UT22084-001-006-8103,folio:F.104.b,volume:V2}}} home after a long time. Oh, cook and prepare a meal immediately. Our son Rāṣṭrapāla will eat it.”
{{milestone:{label:7.79,id:UT22084-001-006-2233}}}The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother then cooked and prepared a meal herself. Then a man piled pieces of gold in such a large heap that someone standing behind it could not see another standing before it, and someone standing before it could not see another standing behind it. The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother said to him, “My son Rāṣṭrapāla, your mother has this amount of what is called dowry, dower, or marriage portion. Your father has also accumulated gold—and hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of fine grains of gold—not to mention other things. My son Rāṣṭrapāla, now stay here and enjoy the objects of desire, give donations, and make merit.”
{{milestone:{label:7.80,id:UT22084-001-006-2234}}}“O householder’s wife, if you will listen to my words with faith, I will instruct and teach you.”

Your sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress have arisen from those roots.”
{{milestone:{label:7.82,id:UT22084-001-006-2237}}}Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother thought, “I am not able to turn back my son Rāṣṭrapāla in this way.” {{page:{number:276,id:UT22084-001-006-8104,folio:F.105.a,volume:V2}}} The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla's mother then urged her daughter-in-law to help: “O my daughter, anoint your body with incense, bathe, wear various scents, dress yourself, adorn yourself with adornments, burn various kinds of incense, and scatter incense powder immediately, just as you once pleased and comforted my son Rāṣṭrapāla in that way when he was a layman. Then throw yourself at my son Rāṣṭrapāla’s feet and say, ‘What are the celestial nymphs like, for the sake of whom you have led the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One?’ ”
{{milestone:{label:7.83,id:UT22084-001-006-2238}}}Then the former wife of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla did anoint her body with incense, bathed, wore various scents, dressed herself, adorned herself with adornments, burned various kinds of incense, and scattered incense powder just as she had once pleased and comforted the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla in that way when he was a layman.

{{milestone:{label:7.85,id:UT22084-001-006-2240}}}Then, because the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla {{page:{number:277,id:UT22084-001-006-8105,folio:F.105.b,volume:V2}}} addressed his former wife as sister, she fainted and fell to the ground.{{note:{index370,id:UT22084-001-006-2241}}} The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then said to his parents, “Father, Mother, why do you not give me food if you were going to give it? Why leave it and torment me?”
“Our son Rāṣṭrapāla, have it.”

When, with their own hands, they had served and satisfied him in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, they took low seats, and sat before the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla in order to hear the Dharma.

The brahmin asked himself, ‘Should I praise the king or the excellent elephant?’ He thought, ‘Since this excellent elephant is desirable and pleasing for everyone in the world and especially so for the king, I will praise the excellent elephant for now.’ He then spoke a verse:

{{milestone:{label:7.161,id:UT22084-001-006-2346}}}The Blessed One arrived in the country of Śrughnā, where there was a brahmin named Indra who was conceited about his good looks, youth, and learning, and boasted that there was no one equal to him.
{{milestone:{label:7.162,id:UT22084-001-006-2347}}}In a certain place the Blessed One preached the Dharma, sitting on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. The brahmin Indra, having heard that the śramaṇa Gautama had arrived in the country of Śrughnā, thought, “I have heard that the śramaṇa Gautama is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. {{page:{number:293,id:UT22084-001-006-8121,folio:F.113.b,volume:V2}}} I will go to see whether he is more handsome than me or not.”

Unable to see it, he climbed up to a very high place, but it was in vain.
{{milestone:{label:7.164,id:UT22084-001-006-2349}}}Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Indra, “Brahmin, you are making vain efforts. Even if you were to climb up to the summit of Mount Sumeru and try to see the crown of the Tathāgata’s head, these further efforts would be in vain, and you would still be unable to see it. Have you never heard that beings, including gods and asuras, do not see the crown of the head of the buddhas, the blessed ones?{{note:{index384,id:UT22084-001-006-2350}}} However, if you want to see the height of the Tathāgata’s body, there is a pillar made of gośīrṣacandana underneath the fire pit for oblations to the god of fire in your house; take it out and measure it. The height of the Tathāgata’s body that is generated from a father and a mother is the same as that.”
{{milestone:{label:7.165,id:UT22084-001-006-2351}}}The brahmin Indra thought, “This is a wonder. I have never heard of that. I will go and see.” 
{{milestone:{label:7.166,id:UT22084-001-006-2352}}}He hurried home and dug under the fire pit for oblations to the god of fire. Everything was just as the Blessed One had explained. Filled with faith, he thought, “Since the śramaṇa Gautama is undoubtedly omniscient, I will go and serve him.” With faith, he went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, face to face with the Blessed One, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, {{page:{number:294,id:UT22084-001-006-8122,folio:F.114.a,volume:V2}}} and then sat down to one side. The Blessed One knew the brahmin’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature . . . .  With the vajra of knowledge the brahmin leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, he said, “O Blessed One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.” 
{{milestone:{label:7.167,id:UT22084-001-006-2353}}}Thereupon the brahmin Indra rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “If the Blessed One allows it, I will prepare a festival of the pillar made of gośīrṣacandana.”
“Brahmin, I allow it,” said the Blessed One. “Go and prepare the festival.”

“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One went to Mathurā, where he saw a green forest rising in the distance. At the sight of it, he said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, do you see the green forest rising?”
{{milestone:{label:8.5,id:UT22084-001-006-2616}}}“Yes, I do, O Honored One.”
“That is a mountain called Urumuṇḍa.{{note:{index455,id:UT22084-001-006-2618}}} When a hundred years have passed after I am completely emancipated, two brothers in Mathurā named Naṭa and Bhaṭa will build a monastery there. {{page:{number:312,id:UT22084-001-006-8140,folio:F.123.a,volume:V2}}} Its name will therefore be Naṭabhaṭika, and it will become the best of the dwelling places that are suited to insight and tranquility.

{{milestone:{label:8.7,id:UT22084-001-006-2623}}}The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that the Blessed One has predicted the venerable Upagupta’s having compassion for many people in the future?”
{{milestone:{label:8.8,id:UT22084-001-006-2624}}}“Listen, monks,” said the Blessed One, “and inscribe it in your minds how, not only in that time, but also previously, he acted for the benefit of many people. I will tell you about it.
{{milestone:{label:8.9,id:UT22084-001-006-2625}}}“In a time long ago, monks, there lived self-awakened ones, ṛṣis, and monkeys on the three sides of this Mount Urumuṇḍa. On one side lived five hundred self-awakened ones, on the second five hundred ṛṣis, and on the third five hundred monkeys. Whenever a child of a monkey {{page:{number:313,id:UT22084-001-006-8141,folio:F.123.b,volume:V2}}} was born, the leader of the monkeys used to kill it. Therefore, the female monkeys, out of sorrow for their children, began to discuss this among themselves: ‘Listen, ladies. Since every time a child is born to us, it is killed by this leader, we must devise a plan regarding this—when any one of us female monkeys has become pregnant, she should not tell the leader.’
{{milestone:{label:8.10,id:UT22084-001-006-2626}}}“Later, when a female monkey became pregnant, they concealed her in a hidden place and fed her with roots and fruits. After the baby monkey was born, they also nourished and raised him in that hidden place. That monkey then grew up and banished the leader from his own troop. The leader began to wander around on Mount Urumuṇḍa. As he wandered he heard the voices of the self-awakened ones and approached them. When he felt comfortable living with them, he offered them roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, and toothpicks. They, too, gave him leftovers from their bowls. Whenever the self-awakened ones had finished their meal, they used to sit with their legs crossed. Observing their behavior, the monkey, too, sat with his legs crossed.
{{milestone:{label:8.11,id:UT22084-001-006-2627}}}“Later, the self-awakened ones thought, ‘Since we have attained what is to be attained with our putrid bodies, we will enter the realm of peaceful emancipation.’ They displayed miracles, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, and causing rain to fall and lightning to strike, and they were completely emancipated in the realm of emancipation without remainder.
{{milestone:{label:8.12,id:UT22084-001-006-2628}}}“They therefore did not rise at their usual hour of rising. When he did not see them, the monkey became anxious. The monkey entered the cave and shook their robes. Then {{page:{number:314,id:UT22084-001-006-8142,folio:F.124.a,volume:V2}}} a deity living in the cave thought, ‘If this monkey destroys the bodies of the self-awakened ones, that would not be appropriate.’ He shut the entrance with a large stone slab and stood there. The monkey felt sorrow and pain and lamentation, and so he departed and wandered on Mount Urumuṇḍa. Anxious, and missing the humans, he strained his ears to hear a human voice, and soon he heard the voices spoken by those ṛṣis. Just like a lost traveler, he hurried to them.
{{milestone:{label:8.13,id:UT22084-001-006-2629}}}“Those ṛṣis were harming themselves with horrible ascetic practices: some were keeping their hands raised, some were standing on one foot, and some were tormenting themselves with fivefold heat.{{note:{index458,id:UT22084-001-006-2630}}} When the monkey felt comfortable living with them, he offered them roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, and toothpicks. They, too, gave him their leftovers. Disrupting their behavior, he taught them the behavior of the self-awakened ones: there he lowered the hands of those who were keeping their hands raised, snapped his fingers, and sat down before them with his legs crossed; he lowered the legs of those who were standing on one foot and sat down before them with his legs crossed; and he put out the fires of those who were tormenting themselves with fivefold heat, snapped his fingers, and sat down before them with his legs crossed. Then the ṛṣis said to their instructor, ‘Master, this monkey interrupts our ascetic practice,’ and they explained everything to him in detail. 
{{milestone:{label:8.14,id:UT22084-001-006-2631}}}“ ‘Sirs,’ he replied, ‘these monkeys have good memories. Since he has certainly seen such behavior by some other ṛṣis, you should sit with your legs crossed, too.’
{{milestone:{label:8.15,id:UT22084-001-006-2632}}}“When they sat with their legs crossed, their previous roots of merit {{page:{number:315,id:UT22084-001-006-8143,folio:F.124.b,volume:V2}}} became manifest. They generated the thirty-seven aspects of awakening with knowledge, without a teacher or preceptor, and actualized the awakening of self-awakened ones. They directed the faith that had emerged from the Dharma to the monkey. Whenever they received fresh crops, fresh fruits, or seasonal foods as alms from people, they gave him some of the food first and after that enjoyed the rest of the food for themselves.
{{milestone:{label:8.16,id:UT22084-001-006-2633}}}“Later, the monkey died. The self-awakened ones gathered fragrant wood from various areas and directions, heaped up all the fragrant wood, and cremated his body.
{{milestone:{label:8.17,id:UT22084-001-006-2634}}}“What do you think, monks? That monkey who lived with the self-awakened ones was indeed this Upagupta. At that time, he acted for the benefit of many people. And now, too, I have predicted his benefiting and having compassion for many people.”

{{milestone:{label:8.18,id:UT22084-001-006-2637}}}Thereupon The Blessed One, traveling in Śūrasena, went to Mathurā.{{note:{index460,id:UT22084-001-006-2638}}} Some brahmins in Mathurā heard that the śramaṇa Gautama had arrived in Mathurā and that, with the strong wish to purify the four castes, he explained, designated, defined, analyzed, expounded, clarified, taught, and perfectly taught. They thought, “If he enters Mathurā, he will be an obstacle to us gaining profit and honors. Since it is known that he is concerned about disrespectful acts, if someone performs disrespectful acts toward him, he will not stay in Mathurā. It would not be surprising if someone from a lowly family performed disrespectful acts toward him, but it would be more effective if some great person did so. Is there any great person among us?”
{{milestone:{label:8.19,id:UT22084-001-006-2639}}}At that time there was a brahmin in Mathurā {{page:{number:316,id:UT22084-001-006-8144,folio:F.125.a,volume:V2}}} named Nīlabhūti, who had mastered the Vedas and the auxiliary branches of the Vedas, who was able to present his own words clearly and defeat others’ criticisms, and whose words followed the truth. Then the brahmins in Mathurā met together, flocked together, went to Nīlabhūti, and said, “Master, it has been heard that the śramaṇa Gautama has come here and that, with the strong wish to purify the four castes, he . . . perfectly teaches. Since it is known that he is concerned about disrespectful acts, if someone performs disrespectful acts toward him, he will not stay in Mathurā.

Who else but you is the great person among us? Please revile him with disrespectful words of blame.”

{{milestone:{label:8.21,id:UT22084-001-006-2641}}}After that, the brahmin Nīlabhūti, attended by the elder brahmins living in Mathurā, went to the Blessed One. The brahmin Nīlabhūti saw from a distance the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, sitting tranquilly under a tree.

After that, the brahmin Nīlabhūti, having praised the Blessed One, departed.

At that time, it was the day of the star festival in Mathurā. A goddess living in Mathurā thought, “If the śramaṇa Gautama comes to Mathurā, he will interrupt my star festival.” She then stood naked before the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “O goddess, a woman does not look beautiful even if she is covered with clothes, let alone naked.”

After that, the Blessed One himself left the road and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks.

Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed . . . the devout brahmins and householders in Mathurā.

In a certain place, five hundred peasants were plowing a field in their hempen lower garments, their heads covered with dust. The peasants saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, . . . and beautiful . . . with light . . . . The Blessed One preached the Dharma for them . . . and they became objects of veneration, respect, and praise.

When they arrived, they sat down, surrounding the Blessed One. When the Blessed One had preached the Dharma that consists of three phrases for them,{{note:{index479,id:UT22084-001-006-2727}}} they were reborn among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings. . . . Having seen the truths, they left for their own residences.
{{milestone:{label:8.81,id:UT22084-001-006-2728}}}The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did these five hundred peasants and these oxen{{note:{index480,id:UT22084-001-006-2729}}} create that matured to cause them to be born as peasants in poor families and to become oxen?”

These oxen, too, went forth there, and they disregarded the minor rules of training; that karma matured to cause them to be reborn among animals. Their karma of going forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa matured to cause them to see the truths in my presence. Therefore, monks, {{page:{number:326,id:UT22084-001-006-8154,folio:F.130.a,volume:V2}}} the maturation of entirely negative actions is . . . . ”

Sirs, the great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that śramaṇa Gautama are known in all directions. Thus, that Blessed One is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. Having in this life, by his own supernormal knowledge, actualized and accomplished awakening, he announced to the world with its gods, Māra, Brahmā, people such as śramaṇas and brahmins, and beings such as gods and humans, ‘My defilements have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ He teaches only the Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good at the end, excellent in meaning, excellent in wording, distinct, complete, pure, and immaculate.” 
{{milestone:{label:8.84,id:UT22084-001-006-2733}}}Thinking that it would be good to see, approach, and serve such a śramaṇa or brahmin, he left Otalā,  riding an entirely white chariot pulled by mares, surrounded and followed by young brahmins, carrying a golden water jar with a handle, {{page:{number:327,id:UT22084-001-006-8155,folio:F.130.b,volume:V2}}} and went to see and serve the Blessed One. Having gone as far as he could go by vehicle, he alighted from the vehicle and entered the park on foot. The very wealthy brahmin Otalāyana went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation with the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side.  Having sat down to one side, the very wealthy brahmin Otalāyana said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, the five faculties have separate fields and separate domains, and each of them experiences its own field and domain but does not experience other fields and domains: namely, the faculty of the eyes, the faculty of the ears, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, and the faculty of the body.

When she had heard the Dharma, Kacaṅgalā leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the four truths of the noble ones, she spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for me is what has never been done for me by my father, my mother, . . . . With the vajra of knowledge I have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that have been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.” And then she spoke these verses:

At that time, in a certain park a brahmin was beginning to sprinkle the park with water, having drawn water from a well. When the brahmin saw the Blessed One from a distance, he thought, “If the śramaṇa Gautama enters the park, the park and the water will be polluted,” and he shut the gate, hid the rope and pitcher, and sat down.

When Agnidatta, the brahmin king, heard that the śramaṇa Gautama, having traveled through Śūrasena, had arrived in Vairambhya and was staying under the neem tree of Naḍera near Vairambhya, he thought, “The śramaṇa Gautama is treated with honor, looked up to, esteemed, venerated, and paid homage to as a worthy man by all the neighboring kings. If I do not treat him with honor, the neighboring kings will reproach me: ‘Sirs, what a fool Agnidatta, the brahmin king, is! While the śramaṇa Gautama has come and is staying in his town, his country, the king does not treat him with honor.’ Now I will offer the śramaṇa Gautama {{page:{number:335,id:UT22084-001-006-8163,folio:F.134.b,volume:V2}}} together with the community of disciples all the requisites.” Having thought this, he went to the Blessed One, displaying great royal treasures and great royal power. When he arrived, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation with the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side. When Agnidatta, the brahmin king, had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, . . . . When he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent. Then Agnidatta, the brahmin king, rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the honorable Gautama with the community of disciples assent to my offer of the requisites for three months: namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.” The Blessed One assented to Agnidatta, the brahmin king, by remaining silent. Then Agnidatta, the brahmin king, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One, and he rose from his seat and departed.
{{milestone:{label:8.121,id:UT22084-001-006-2801}}}He went to his own residence and ordered his ministers, “Every day cook eighteen kinds of food, various kinds of bean paste, tasty sauce, and much rice for five hundred people.” Then he proclaimed with the ringing of bells: “None but I should offer meals to the śramaṇa Gautama for three months. Anyone who offers him a meal will be killed as punishment.”
{{milestone:{label:8.122,id:UT22084-001-006-2802}}}After issuing this proclamation with the ringing of bells, he dreamt while sleeping in the night that the entire city of Vairambhya was encircled with his own intestine.{{note:{index498,id:UT22084-001-006-2803}}} Having dreamt this, {{page:{number:336,id:UT22084-001-006-8164,folio:F.135.a,volume:V2}}} he sprang to his feet from his large bed, frightened and dejected, with the hairs in every pore of his body standing on end. He sat plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, asking himself, “Oh, is there any chance I will lose my throne or be in danger of death because of this?” After the night had passed, he said to the brahmin who was the chief priest, “Sir, I have dreamt such-and-such. What should I do about this?”
{{milestone:{label:8.123,id:UT22084-001-006-2804}}}The brahmin chief priest thought, “The king has had an auspicious dream. Since, if I speak well of it, he will increase his faith in the śramaṇa Gautama all the more, I will now speak ill of it.” He said, “Your Majesty, this is an inauspicious dream.”
{{milestone:{label:8.124,id:UT22084-001-006-2805}}}“Sir, what will be the result of this?”

{{milestone:{label:8.127,id:UT22084-001-006-2809}}}Agnidatta, the brahmin king, thought, “If so, that is easy to do. I will make a proclamation with the ringing of bells.” He proclaimed throughout the country with the ringing of bells: “No one should come to see me for three months. Anyone who comes to me will be killed as punishment.” After issuing this proclamation with the ringing of bells, he did stay in a concealed location for three months.
{{milestone:{label:8.128,id:UT22084-001-006-2810}}}The venerable Ānanda rose at dawn and went to the residence of Agnidatta, the brahmin king.

{{milestone:{label:8.135,id:UT22084-001-006-2819}}}At that time, a caravan leader with five hundred loaded horses arrived at Vairambhya from the northern region.

{{milestone:{label:8.235,id:UT22084-001-006-2961}}}“Since they were of honest character, they showed him the almsfood; being of jealous character, he found it unbearable.

Because of the maturation of those actions—namely, my speaking harsh words out of malice toward the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin’s disciples who were undergoing training and had completed training, the four hundred ninety-eight young brahmins’ agreeing, and the two others’ disagreeing—the Tathāgata ate rotten barley with the four hundred ninety-eight monks in Vairambhya at that time, while Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana enjoyed divine nectar.

With the vajra of knowledge we have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. O Honored One, we have been exalted, truly exalted. Since we seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept us as lay brothers.

{{milestone:{label:9.18,id:UT22084-001-006-3157}}}Then the Blessed One traveled to Śrāvastī. In a certain place, a brahmin was plowing a field. He had not had a meal, and a girl brought rice soup for him. The Blessed One also came to that place.
{{milestone:{label:9.19,id:UT22084-001-006-3158}}}As soon as the brahmin saw the Buddha, the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, faith in the Blessed One arose in him.
{{milestone:{label:9.20,id:UT22084-001-006-3159}}}Whenever a being who has accumulated roots of merit looks at the Buddha for the first time, he experiences far greater pleasure than that of those who have practiced tranquility of mind for a dozen years, those who gain a son after having been childless, those who look upon treasure after having been poor, or those who are anointed as king after having longed for kingship.
{{milestone:{label:9.21,id:UT22084-001-006-3160}}}The brahmin quickly went to the Blessed One, bringing the rice soup. When he arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, this is rice soup. If the Honorable Gautama has compassion for me, {{page:{number:381,id:UT22084-001-006-8209,folio:F.157.b,volume:V2}}} please accept this rice soup.”
{{milestone:{label:9.22,id:UT22084-001-006-3161}}}Then the Blessed One indicated to the brahmin an old well and said, “Brahmin, if you are giving it completely, pour it into this old well.”
{{milestone:{label:9.23,id:UT22084-001-006-3162}}}The brahmin poured it into the old well. When he had done this, by the awakened power of the buddhas and the divine power of the gods, the old well became piping hot, full of rice soup. The Blessed One then called the brahmin and said, “Brahmin, distribute the rice soup.”
{{milestone:{label:9.24,id:UT22084-001-006-3163}}}When he began to distribute it, the Blessed One exercised his magical power so that even when the entire community had eaten it, the old well remained piping hot, full of rice soup. After that, his faith in the Blessed One increased all the more, the brahmin paid homage at the Blessed One’s feet and sat down in front of him in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.  . . . With the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. “O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, may you accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.” 
{{milestone:{label:9.25,id:UT22084-001-006-3164}}}Thereupon, like a merchant who had obtained merchandise, like a farmer who had gotten a bumper crop, like a warrior who had won a battle, like a patient who had been cured of every disease, having rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One, {{page:{number:382,id:UT22084-001-006-8210,folio:F.158.a,volume:V2}}} the brahmin bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he departed from the Blessed One’s presence. When he arrived at the field, he saw golden barley growing there. Upon seeing it, his eyes opened wide with astonishment and he spoke a verse:
{{milestone:{label:9.26,id:UT22084-001-006-3165}}}“How great the field is, which has
The nature of merit and is free from all faults—

{{milestone:{label:9.27,id:UT22084-001-006-3167}}}Thereupon the brahmin hurried to the king. When he arrived, he wished the king victory and long life and said, “Your Majesty, the barley I sowed has become gold. Please appoint an overseer{{note:{index576,id:UT22084-001-006-3168}}} there.”
{{milestone:{label:9.28,id:UT22084-001-006-3169}}}The king appointed an overseer and sent him. The brahmin piled the gold up and divided it, but the king’s portion changed into ordinary barley. The overseer reported this to the king, and then the king ordered, “Have it divided again.” When he divided the barley again, still the king’s portion changed into ordinary barley. He divided it seven times in all, only to have the same result each time. Prompted by curiosity, the king himself went there and watched, and the result was the same. He said to the brahmin, “Brahmin, since this has been produced by your merit, the king’s portion is no longer required. Give me what you have measured.”
{{milestone:{label:9.29,id:UT22084-001-006-3170}}}Then the brahmin was much delighted, and what he gave became gold.

At that time, in a certain place, five hundred peasants were plowing a field, looking pale, their feet and hands covered with cuts, and wearing hempen lower garments. The oxen, too, were plowing the field with sighs, their bodies hurt and wounded by being struck with spiked sticks, pus oozing from their wounds. The peasants then saw the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, {{page:{number:383,id:UT22084-001-006-8211,folio:F.158.b,volume:V2}}} illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns.{{note:{index578,id:UT22084-001-006-3174}}} Whenever beings who have accumulated roots of merit look at the Buddha for the first time . . . .

When from a distance the Blessed One saw the peasants coming, he left the road and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks in order to convert the peasants. The peasants bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. The Blessed One knew the peasants’ thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them and that caused them to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones . . . .

{{milestone:{label:9.32,id:UT22084-001-006-3176}}}After having seen the truths, they made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said to him, “O Honored One, we wish to go forth and be ordained monks in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.

There they did not recite, repeat, or practice concentration of the mind but rather were attached to the crowd and spent their time lazily, having enjoyed things given out of faith.

Because of the maturation of the karma—namely, their not reciting, repeating, or practicing concentration of the mind and their being attached to the crowd and spending time lazily, having enjoyed things given out of the faith of the owner of the monastery—they were the peasants of the owner of the monastery for five hundred lives, and now they were also born among peasants. Because they went forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and led the pure life, they now went forth in my teaching, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat.

When he saw the Jetavana, there was no one there. He asked a monk who was responsible for monastic property, “Where is the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”
The monk told him, “They have been invited by the householder Anāthapiṇḍada.” {{page:{number:393,id:UT22084-001-006-8221,folio:F.163.b,volume:V2}}}
{{milestone:{label:9.75,id:UT22084-001-006-3257}}}The venerable Mahākāśyapa thought, “I will eat almsfood there and serve the community of monks headed by the Buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:9.76,id:UT22084-001-006-3258}}}When he went to the house of the householder Anāthapiṇḍada, the doorkeeper said, “O noble one, please do not enter the house.”
“Why?”
{{milestone:{label:9.77,id:UT22084-001-006-3260}}}“The householder Anāthapiṇḍada ordered me, ‘Do not let non-Buddhist ascetics enter the house until the community of monks headed by the Buddha has finished the meal. After that, I will give a meal to the non-Buddhist ascetics.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:9.78,id:UT22084-001-006-3261}}}“I have attained a great boon,” thought the venerable Mahākāśyapa, “for the brahmins and householders do not know me to be a śramaṇa who is a son of the Śākyans. I will go and practice compassion for poor people.” With this thought, he went to a park and asked himself, “Whom should I accept as a follower today?”
{{milestone:{label:9.79,id:UT22084-001-006-3262}}}Shortly afterward, he approached a leprous beggar woman{{note:{index600,id:UT22084-001-006-3263}}} who was wandering and begging, and from whose body pus and blood were oozing. She had obtained by begging water that had been used for boiling rice. She saw the venerable Mahākāśyapa, whose body was beautiful, whose mind was pure, and whose behavior was calm, and thought, “I have certainly not performed any service for such a one worthy of veneration in the past; because of that, I am now in this circumstance. If the noble one Mahākāśyapa accepts out of compassion for me this water that had been used for boiling rice, I will offer it to him.”
{{milestone:{label:9.80,id:UT22084-001-006-3264}}}The venerable Mahākāśyapa knew her thoughts and held out his bowl, saying, “Sister, if you will give it to me, please pour it into this bowl.” Then her mind was filled with faith. When she poured the water into the bowl, a bee fell into it. She tried to remove it, but then one of her fingers broke off and fell into the water that had been used for boiling rice. She thought, “Even though the noble one, concerned about my feelings, may not throw it out, he will not consume it.”
{{milestone:{label:9.81,id:UT22084-001-006-3265}}}The venerable Mahākāśyapa, knowing her thoughts, {{page:{number:394,id:UT22084-001-006-8222,folio:F.164.a,volume:V2}}} went to a wall in front of her, sat down by the wall, and ate. She thought, “Although the noble one, concerned about my feelings, has eaten some of the food, it will not serve as a meal.”
{{milestone:{label:9.82,id:UT22084-001-006-3266}}}The venerable Mahākāśyapa, knowing her thoughts, said to the beggar woman, “Rejoice, sister. I will live for a whole day and night with this meal given by you.”
{{milestone:{label:9.83,id:UT22084-001-006-3267}}}She rejoiced greatly, thinking, “I offered almsfood to the noble one Mahākāśyapa, and he accepted it!” She died, her mind filled with faith in the venerable Mahākāśyapa, and was reborn among the gods of Tuṣita.
{{milestone:{label:9.84,id:UT22084-001-006-3268}}}Śakra, Lord of the Gods, saw her offer water that had been used for boiling rice, gain faith, and die, but he did not see where she was reborn, even though he tried to find her among the beings of hell, the animals, the hungry ghosts, the humans, the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, and the Thirty-Three Gods. Thus, the knowledge of gods works downward, not upward. 
{{milestone:{label:9.85,id:UT22084-001-006-3269}}}Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he asked the Blessed One a question, singing it in verse:
{{milestone:{label:9.86,id:UT22084-001-006-3270}}}“Where is the woman rejoicing,
Who offered water used for boiling rice to Kāśyapa,
When Kāśyapa, the one of great nature,
Was going around begging?”
{{milestone:{label:9.87,id:UT22084-001-006-3271}}}The Blessed One answered:
“Those gods called Tuṣita
Are rich in every object of desire.
The woman who offered water used for boiling rice to Kāśyapa
Is rejoicing there.”
{{milestone:{label:9.88,id:UT22084-001-006-3273}}}Śakra, Lord of the Gods, then thought, “These humans give donations and make merit, even though they do not understand merit. Why should I, who does understand merit and am now enjoying the fruit of my merit, not give donations and make merit? {{page:{number:395,id:UT22084-001-006-8223,folio:F.164.b,volume:V2}}} Since this noble one Mahākāśyapa is compassionate toward those who are wretched, helpless, poor, and destitute, I will now offer almsfood to him.”
{{milestone:{label:9.89,id:UT22084-001-006-3274}}}He produced a solitary, tumbledown, very shabby house in a village of the poor, and he himself changed into a shaggy-haired weaver in a hempen garment, whose limbs were covered with cuts, and began to weave cloth. Śacī, a goddess, dressed as the wife of the weaver and began to weave, throwing the shuttle.{{note:{index601,id:UT22084-001-006-3275}}} Divine food was prepared by his side.
{{milestone:{label:9.90,id:UT22084-001-006-3276}}}Then, being compassionate toward those who are wretched, helpless, and destitute, the venerable Mahākāśyapa arrived in due course at the house. When he stood at the door holding his bowl, thinking that it was a suffering man, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, filled the bowl with divine food. The venerable Mahākāśyapa then thought:
{{milestone:{label:9.91,id:UT22084-001-006-3277}}}“The meal of this man is divine nectar,
Whereas his house is this humble in size.
With the thought that this was a great contradiction,
Doubt has arisen in my mind.”{{note:{index602,id:UT22084-001-006-3278}}}
{{milestone:{label:9.92,id:UT22084-001-006-3279}}}It is natural that the knowledge of arhats does not function when they are not particularly attentive. When he focused his attention, he saw that the man was Śakra, Lord of the Gods, and said, “O Kauśika, the arrows of your longtime uncertainty and doubt have been uprooted by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, so why do you interfere with suffering people?”
{{milestone:{label:9.93,id:UT22084-001-006-3280}}}“O noble one Mahākāśyapa, why do I interfere with suffering people? These humans give donations and make merit, even though they do not understand merit.

Those who have made merit
Will rejoice in this world and the next.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:9.95,id:UT22084-001-006-3282}}}Thereafter the venerable Mahākāśyapa was attentive whenever he entered a house for alms. At that time, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, remaining in the air, filled the venerable Mahākāśyapa’s bowl with divine food. The venerable Mahākāśyapa turned the bowl upside down, whereupon the food and drink were wasted. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “On account of that, I authorize you to have a cover for a bowl.”{{note:{index603,id:UT22084-001-006-3283}}}

{{milestone:{label:9.98,id:UT22084-001-006-3288}}}The Blessed One assented to King Prasenajit of Kosala by remaining silent. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed from his presence. Thereupon King Prasenajit of Kosala prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After he rose at dawn, he prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Blessed One know the time by messenger . . . with his own hands he served and satisfied them . . . .
{{milestone:{label:9.99,id:UT22084-001-006-3289}}}A certain beggar was sitting in the elder’s seat. His mind was filled with faith when he thought, “Understanding merit and enjoying the fruit of his merit, this king gives donations and makes merit, not content with the merit there is.”
{{milestone:{label:9.100,id:UT22084-001-006-3290}}}King Prasenajit of Kosala, with his own hands, served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with a pure and fine meal. Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One said, “Great King, to whose name shall I assign the rewards of the offerings, yours or that of someone who has made greater merit than you?”
{{milestone:{label:9.101,id:UT22084-001-006-3291}}}The king thought, “The Blessed One has accepted the almsfood from me.

{{milestone:{label:9.104,id:UT22084-001-006-3295}}}Then an old minister said, “Your Majesty, do not worry. We will somehow arrange it so that tomorrow the Blessed One will assign the rewards of the offerings to the name of Your Majesty only.” He then instructed the laborers, “Tomorrow you should prepare finer food, so that half of the distributed food will enter the monks’ bowls and the other half will fall on the ground somehow.”
{{milestone:{label:9.105,id:UT22084-001-006-3296}}}The next day they prepared finer food. Then, knowing that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, they began to serve them, placing half of the food into the monks’ bowls and letting the other half fall on the ground. The beggar rushed to gather the food that had fallen on the ground, but the waiters blocked him. Then the beggar said, “If this king has much treasure, why does he not give it to suffering, begging people like us? What is the use of this wasted food?” His mind being disturbed, the beggar was not able to maintain his mind filled with faith as before.

As the hunter looked at her, who was extremely well proportioned and pleasant to behold, he touched her, trying to grasp her. She said:

It was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people; there was no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, or robbers; illness had abated; and it was abundant in rice, sugarcane, cattle, and buffalo.

If such a thing were true, each person would have a thousand sons just like a wheel-turning king. Rather, sons and daughters are born because three conditions are satisfied. What are the three? Affected by passion the parents have intercourse, the mother is healthy and in her fertile period, and a gandharva is around and wants to enter the womb. When these three conditions are satisfied, sons and daughters are born.

{{milestone:{label:9.1508,id:UT22084-001-006-5417}}}The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī. He was treated with honor, looked up to . . . .{{note:{index935,id:UT22084-001-006-5418}}} At that time, many wandering mendicants belonging to a different faith sat together in a meeting hall and talked with each other: “Sirs, please understand that once we were treated with honor, looked up to, and esteemed by kings, ministers, brahmins, householders, citizens, provincial dwellers, merchants, the heads of guilds, and caravan leaders. Thus, the requisites were obtained for us, too, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding, and medicines for the sick. Now, however, they treat with honor, look up to, esteem, and venerate the śramaṇa Gautama who has appeared in the world, and the requisites are obtained only for him, namely . . . medicines for the sick. Because of this, our gain and honor have now been completely lost. What should we do about this?”
{{milestone:{label:9.1509,id:UT22084-001-006-5419}}}Then someone suggested, {{page:{number:627,id:UT22084-001-006-8456,folio:F.280.b,volume:V2}}} “Sexual intercourse is a fault for those who lead the pure life. So, let us lay this fault on him.”
“How should we do that?” asked another.
{{milestone:{label:9.1510,id:UT22084-001-006-5421}}}They then decided, “We should entice a female mendicant among us who is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold: ‘Sister, now slander the śramaṇa Gautama.’ ”{{note:{index936,id:UT22084-001-006-5422}}}
{{milestone:{label:9.1511,id:UT22084-001-006-5423}}}“Which female mendicant among us is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold?”
“The brahmin girl Cañcā is. Let us entice her.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1512,id:UT22084-001-006-5425}}}They summoned her by messenger and said, “Sister, understand that once we were treated with honor . . . . The requisites were obtained for us, namely, . . . medicines for the sick. However, since the śramaṇa Gautama appeared in the world, people treat him with honor, and our gain and honor have now been completely lost. Are you going to ignore this?”
{{milestone:{label:9.1513,id:UT22084-001-006-5426}}}“Noble ones, what should I do about that?” asked the brahmin girl, the female mendicant Cañcā.
“Sister, can you slander the śramaṇa Gautama for the sake of your relatives, saying, ‘He had sexual intercourse with me’? If you do this, our gain and honor will be restored.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1514,id:UT22084-001-006-5428}}}Having heard this proposal, the brahmin girl Cañcā answered the many wandering mendicants belonging to a different faith: “Noble ones, I would not like to slander the śramaṇa Gautama.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1515,id:UT22084-001-006-5429}}}“Sister, unless you slander the śramaṇa Gautama, you may not have any conversation with us, speak in a friendly manner with us, meet us, or see us. We will not let you stay anywhere. It is possible that you will die from grief over this and be reborn in various hells.”
(Women have little wisdom.)
{{milestone:{label:9.1516,id:UT22084-001-006-5431}}}Thus she became afraid and said, “Noble ones, I will do so.”
“Sister, for now pay frequent visits to the Jetavana, {{page:{number:628,id:UT22084-001-006-8457,folio:F.281.a,volume:V2}}} and then slander the śramaṇa Gautama sometime later.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1517,id:UT22084-001-006-5433}}}She visited the Jetavana after waking up every morning. Later, she tied a vessel to her belly and went to the Blessed One. At that time, the Blessed One was preaching the Dharma in front of an audience of hundreds. When the Blessed One saw the brahmin girl, the female mendicant Cañcā, from a distance, he thought, “The actions were performed and accumulated by me, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach me like a flood, inevitably. Who else but me would experience the actions that will certainly appear?”
{{milestone:{label:9.1518,id:UT22084-001-006-5434}}}Thereupon the brahmin girl, the female mendicant Cañcā, sat down in front of the Blessed One and said:

“One who tells a lie goes to hell.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1521,id:UT22084-001-006-5438}}}The brahmin girl Cañcā replied,
“So does one who claims ‘I did not’ after he did.” 
{{milestone:{label:9.1522,id:UT22084-001-006-5442}}}The Blessed One countered:
“Both of them, who are naturally inferior,

{{milestone:{label:9.1523,id:UT22084-001-006-5445}}}Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, “Alas, this brahmin girl Cañcā has been planning to harm the Blessed One and the community of monks for a long time!” He caused the vessel to fall on the ground through his magical power.

{{milestone:{label:9.1524,id:UT22084-001-006-5450}}}Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, the discourse concerned with the Dharma was given to King Prasenajit of Kosala. Where you formed the resolve toward supreme and complete awakening for the first time and how many completely awakened ones {{page:{number:629,id:UT22084-001-006-8458,folio:F.281.b,volume:V2}}} the Blessed One served were also explained.{{note:{index940,id:UT22084-001-006-5451}}} Thus, we will go to the great lake Anavatapta and, in the presence of the Blessed One, explain the karmic bond of each of us.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1525,id:UT22084-001-006-5452}}}The Blessed One assented to the monks who were the most venerable of the elders by remaining silent.
{{milestone:{label:9.1526,id:UT22084-001-006-5453}}}It is natural that the buddhas, the blessed ones, without fail perform ten acts while alive. What are the ten? (1) To predict a future buddha; (2) to cause some beings to make the resolution to attain complete and supreme awakening without regressing; (3) to convert all those who are to be converted by that buddha; (4) to indicate the best two of their disciples; (5) to establish the boundary of the community; (6) to abandon one fifth of their life; (7) to display a great miracle in Śrāvastī; (8) to show themselves descending from among the gods in the city of Sāṃkāśya; (9) to establish their parents in the truths; (10) and to show the former karmic bonds together with the community of disciples on the great lake Anavatapta.{{note:{index941,id:UT22084-001-006-5454}}} The buddhas, the blessed ones, do not become completely emancipated until they have performed these acts. In this case, the Blessed One wished to explain the former karmic bonds together with the community of disciples on the great lake Anavatapta. He said to the monks, “Monks, let us go to the great lake Anavatapta and explain the former karmic bonds there.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1527,id:UT22084-001-006-5455}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the monks to the Blessed One. Thereupon the Blessed One, together with four hundred ninety-nine arhats, disappeared from Śrāvastī and went to the great lake Anavatapta.

{{milestone:{label:9.1530,id:UT22084-001-006-5459}}}Thereupon the Blessed One entertained mundane thoughts. It naturally occurs that when the buddhas, the blessed ones, entertain mundane thoughts, living creatures, including those as small as ants, understand the Blessed One’s thoughts. The nāga kings Nanda and Upananda therefore wondered, “Why did the Blessed One entertain mundane thoughts?” They then saw that the Blessed One intended to explain the former karmic bonds on the great lake Anavatapta. And so, in the middle of the great lake Anavatapta they created a lotus blossom with a thousand petals, which was as large as the wheel of a chariot, beautiful, and made entirely of gold, and whose stalk was made of jewels, whose filaments were made of diamonds, and which was surrounded by thousands of other lotus blossoms. The Blessed One sat in the center of the lotus blossom before the community of monks. The monks who were the most venerable of the elders also sat in the centers of the other lotus blossoms.

{{milestone:{label:9.1531,id:UT22084-001-006-5464}}}At that time, the venerable Śāriputra was sewing his outer robe on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, go and bring your going-forth companion.” 
{{milestone:{label:9.1532,id:UT22084-001-006-5465}}}“Certainly, O Honored One.” The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana then disappeared from the great lake Anavatapta and instantly stood in front of the venerable Śāriputra on Gṛdhrakūṭa. He said, “O Venerable Śāriputra, the Teacher is waiting for you, intending to explain the former karmic bonds together with four hundred ninety-nine arhats on The great lake Anavatapta. Let us go there.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1533,id:UT22084-001-006-5466}}}“O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana,” replied Śāriputra, “for the time being, I will sew my outer robe. After that, I will go.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1534,id:UT22084-001-006-5467}}}“I will help you,” said Mahā­maudgalyāyana.
“Please do so.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1535,id:UT22084-001-006-5469}}}Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana began to sew, using the five fingers of each hand with his magical power. The venerable Śāriputra said, {{page:{number:631,id:UT22084-001-006-8460,folio:F.282.b,volume:V2}}} “O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, now then, let’s finish sewing.”{{note:{index945,id:UT22084-001-006-5470}}}
{{milestone:{label:9.1536,id:UT22084-001-006-5471}}}“O Venerable Śāriputra,” replied Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “if you do not go on your own, I will take you by force.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1537,id:UT22084-001-006-5472}}}The venerable Śāriputra then took off his belt and said, “O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, since you have been praised by the Blessed One as the best of those who possess magical power, you should take this first and take me afterward.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1538,id:UT22084-001-006-5473}}}Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana pulled it. The venerable Śāriputra thought, “Since he possesses great dignity and great magical power, it is possible that he will take it.” He then tied it around the summit of Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana pulled it again, Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa quaked. The venerable Śāriputra thought, “He might take even Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. I will now tie it around Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains.” He then did tie it around Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains. Again, when the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana pulled it, Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, quaked, as did the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda. The entire Anavatapta also trembled, and the monks who were the most venerable of the elders shook, too. Sitting in the centers of the lotus blossoms, they asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, why are the two nāga kings Nanda and Upananda quaking?”
{{milestone:{label:9.1539,id:UT22084-001-006-5474}}}“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “Nanda and Upananda are not quaking by themselves, but because the two great disciples are displaying their magical power.”
{{milestone:{label:9.1540,id:UT22084-001-006-5475}}}The venerable Śāriputra thought, “Since even this Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, might be taken,{{note:{index946,id:UT22084-001-006-5476}}} I will now tie the belt around the stalk of the lotus on which the Blessed One is sitting.” He then did tie it around the stalk of the lotus on which the Blessed One was sitting, and it remained unmoving. When his magical power was hindered thus by the other’s magical power, Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the venerable Śāriputra, “O Venerable Śāriputra, you have finished playing with your magical power. {{page:{number:632,id:UT22084-001-006-8461,folio:F.283.a,volume:V2}}} Now, please come.”

He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat in the center of a lotus blossom. Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana arrived.

Why does he not come out the door?’ He went there and saw the man hanged and dead.

I made a mechanical woman to attend on him and gave it to him. He took it by the hand and pulled it, whereupon it fell into a pile of wooden pieces. Ashamed, he hanged himself.

{{milestone:{label:9.2522,id:UT22084-001-006-6740}}}Then the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu met together in a meeting hall and started the following conversation: “The śramaṇa Gautama is greedy, and so are his disciples.”
“Sirs,” said others, “the śramaṇa Gautama is not greedy, and neither are his disciples. The non-Buddhist ascetics are not like them.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2523,id:UT22084-001-006-6742}}}At that time, a brahmin named Vairaṭṭasiṃha was attending the meeting.{{note:{index1073,id:UT22084-001-006-6743}}} The brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha said to the other brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu, {{page:{number:730,id:UT22084-001-006-8559,folio:F.16.a,volume:V3}}} “I will prove to you whether the śramaṇa Gautama is greedy or not, and whether his disciples are greedy or not.”

{{milestone:{label:9.2525,id:UT22084-001-006-6745}}}The Blessed One assented to the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha by remaining silent. Then the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, departed from the Blessed One’s presence. Thereupon the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, since the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha, who finds fault with us, has invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal of guḍa, you should take only as much food as you can eat, and no more.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2526,id:UT22084-001-006-6746}}}The brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha possessed five hundred guḍa-selling houses. He took a pan of guḍa from each guḍa house, and went to the Blessed One, bringing five hundred pans of guḍa. When he arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honorable Gautama, the guḍa is ready. Please sit down with the community of monks and eat.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2527,id:UT22084-001-006-6747}}}Then the Blessed One washed his hands and bowl and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha took a pan and began to distribute the guḍa, the Blessed One exercised his magical power so that the food fully remained even after it had been distributed among the entire community of monks. Then the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha {{page:{number:731,id:UT22084-001-006-8560,folio:F.16.b,volume:V3}}} was filled with faith. Filled with faith, he then spoke out everywhere: “Sirs, the śramaṇa Gautama is not greedy, and neither are his disciples!”
{{milestone:{label:9.2528,id:UT22084-001-006-6748}}}Thereupon he invited non-Buddhist ascetics to have guḍa. After they had received the guḍa in a careless manner, some ate it, and some filled pans and took them away, spilling the guḍa everywhere. Then the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha said, “Foolish ones, none but you are greedy. The śramaṇa Gautama is not greedy, and neither are his disciples.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2529,id:UT22084-001-006-6749}}}Having thus spoken, his faith in the Blessed One increased more and more and he went to the Blessed One.

The Blessed One wondered, “Why does the monk Vairaṭṭasiṃha not see the truth while he is in his final life?” He then realized that it was due to the foul odor from a decomposed body. The Blessed One {{page:{number:732,id:UT22084-001-006-8561,folio:F.17.a,volume:V3}}} then ordered the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and scatter perfume, garlands, incense smoke, and incense powder in Vairaṭṭasiṃha’s monastery, perfume his bedding and seat with incense smoke, and set up a flower parasol decorated with fragrant flowers.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2533,id:UT22084-001-006-6755}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. He went to Vairaṭṭasiṃha’s monastery while he was walking for alms and did everything as instructed by the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:9.2534,id:UT22084-001-006-6756}}}When he finished begging for alms, the venerable Vairaṭṭasiṃha returned to the monastery and saw the divine splendor. Then he ate the almsfood with his mind delighted. When he finished his meal, he washed his feet outside the monastery, entered the monastery, sat with his legs crossed, stretched his back, and focused his mind on a point in front of himself. As he smelled the sweet fragrance, his mind became concentrated. Then he abandoned all defilements and realized the state of an arhat . . . and he became an object of . . . praise.
{{milestone:{label:9.2535,id:UT22084-001-006-6757}}}Just then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, the best of my monks, my disciples, for being liberated through what is attractive is this monk Vairaṭṭasiṃha.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2536,id:UT22084-001-006-6758}}}The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that whereas other monks were liberated through what was unattractive, the venerable Vairaṭṭasiṃha was liberated through what was attractive?”
{{milestone:{label:9.2537,id:UT22084-001-006-6759}}}“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “he would die among the Thirty-Three Gods and was always reborn into the same place for five hundred lives. He now {{page:{number:733,id:UT22084-001-006-8562,folio:F.17.b,volume:V3}}} has been born among humans in his final life. He was not able to attain concentration of mind as he smelled a decomposed body. When he smelled the sweet fragrance, he was able to attain concentration of mind and thus was liberated through what was attractive. If this means had not been devised for him, he would not have attained even the stage of warmth. Therefore, I authorize those who will be liberated through such attractive things to follow this precedent. You should not have any regrets about this.”

{{milestone:{label:9.2585,id:UT22084-001-006-6827}}}“Monks, once there lived a garland maker in Vārāṇasī. He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a son was born. He arranged for a wife for the son, too, from a family that was equal to his.
{{milestone:{label:9.2586,id:UT22084-001-006-6828}}}“Later, he became very poor. He and his son, wife, and daughter-in-law obtained a sheet of cloth with great effort. Then, wearing it, the garland maker offered flowers to a king. The garland maker’s wife also offered flowers to the queens, wearing the same cloth. The garland maker’s son also offered flowers to the princes, wearing the same cloth. The garland maker’s daughter-in-law also offered flowers to the king’s daughters-in-law, wearing the same cloth.
{{milestone:{label:9.2587,id:UT22084-001-006-6829}}}“When the buddhas do not appear, {{page:{number:742,id:UT22084-001-006-8571,folio:F.22.a,volume:V3}}} there appear self-awakened ones as the only fields of merit in the world, who are compassionate toward inferior, wretched people and content with places to sit in the outskirts of towns.
{{milestone:{label:9.2588,id:UT22084-001-006-6830}}}“At that time a certain self-awakened one, traveling through the country, arrived at Vārāṇasī toward nightfall. He stayed at the garland maker’s house, which was near the entrance to the city, and spent the night in his household garden. He meditated there on the element of fire, at which point the garland maker saw something like a mass of burning flames. Faith having arisen in him, he told his wife about this, and she also gained faith. She told her son, and he also gained faith. He told his wife, and she also gained faith. Thereupon they began to talk among themselves: ‘Let’s together offer a meal to this mendicant, who has a tranquil nature, even if we do not eat anything tomorrow.’
{{milestone:{label:9.2589,id:UT22084-001-006-6831}}}“Thereupon, when the night had passed, they did offer almsfood to the self-awakened one. The garland maker said to his wife, ‘Good lady, I will offer my share of the cloth to this mendicant.’
“ ‘My dear, I will offer mine, too,’ she replied.
{{milestone:{label:9.2590,id:UT22084-001-006-6833}}}“ ‘I will offer mine, too.’ said the son.
“And the daughter-in-law said, ‘I will offer mine, too.’
{{milestone:{label:9.2591,id:UT22084-001-006-6835}}}“Then they together dressed him with the cloth. Since such great people do not show things by words but through physical actions, then, out of compassion for them, the great man soared high into the air and began to display miracles, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, causing rain to fall, and causing lightning to strike. Since ordinary people tend to be swiftly attracted by magical powers, they bowed down to his feet like trees that had been cut at the roots and made aspirations: ‘By this root of merit from our performing a service for the excellent human field of merit, may we be born into a family that is rich and has great wealth and many possessions! May our house be blessed with divine and human fortune! {{page:{number:743,id:UT22084-001-006-8572,folio:F.22.b,volume:V3}}} May we, having attained such qualities, please a teacher who is nobler than this man and not displease him!’
{{milestone:{label:9.2592,id:UT22084-001-006-6836}}}“Thereupon, having exercised his magical power out of compassion for them, the self-awakened one left, flying over the king’s residence. As his shadow fell on the king, the king looked up and saw the great man. He wondered, ‘Whose root of poverty was removed by this great man?’
{{milestone:{label:9.2593,id:UT22084-001-006-6837}}}“The time passed when the garland maker usually offered flowers to the king, and the king was kept waiting for his flowers. Then the garland maker was summoned by the king’s men. The king asked him, ‘Why are you late in bringing flowers today?’
{{milestone:{label:9.2594,id:UT22084-001-006-6838}}}“He explained what had happened in detail. Then the king gave him as many clothes as he needed. Likewise, the queens gave the garland maker’s wife as many clothes as she needed. So did the princes and the king’s daughters-in-law to the garland maker’s son and daughter-in-law, respectively. The garland maker had plenty of flowers, which were his property, and was short of nothing for the rest of his life.
{{milestone:{label:9.2595,id:UT22084-001-006-6839}}}“What do you think, monks? That one who was the garland maker at that time, on that occasion, was indeed Dhanika. Those who were the garland maker’s wife, son, and daughter-in-law were Dhanika’s wife, son, and daughter-in-law. Because of the maturation of the karma, namely, their performing a service for the self-awakened one and making aspirations, they were born into a family that was rich and had great wealth and many possessions, and their house was blessed with divine and human fortune. {{page:{number:744,id:UT22084-001-006-8573,folio:F.23.a,volume:V3}}} They saw truths in my presence and pleased me, a teacher who is nobler than a hundred thousand times ten million self-awakened ones, and did not displease me.

{{milestone:{label:9.2597,id:UT22084-001-006-6842}}}Thereupon, having greatly increased their faith, the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī rose from their seats, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, in our house for three months.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2598,id:UT22084-001-006-6843}}}The Blessed One assented to the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī by remaining silent. Then the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from their seats, and departed. Thereupon the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . Knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, they took low seats and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī through talk consistent with the Dharma, and then rose from his seat and departed. {{page:{number:745,id:UT22084-001-006-8574,folio:F.23.b,volume:V3}}} Two or three days passed in this manner.
{{milestone:{label:9.2599,id:UT22084-001-006-6844}}}The brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī had many attendants. Since a famine had broken out and their kinsmen came to them in search of food, they became oppressed by them and said to the monks, “O noble ones, since a famine has broken out, our kinsmen have come to us to beg for food. Since we give them food every day, we are not able to attend to both you and them sufficiently. O noble ones, we will give you necessities. Please prepare your food by yourselves.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2600,id:UT22084-001-006-6845}}}“We will first ask the Blessed One,” the monks replied.
The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “On account of that, I authorize monks to prepare their food.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2601,id:UT22084-001-006-6847}}}Since the Blessed One had said that monks may prepare food, they began to prepare food. Then they prepared rice soup, cooking it in the open air, but it was ruined because of rainfall. When they reported this matter to the Blessed One, he said, “You should not cook in the open air.”
{{milestone:{label:9.2602,id:UT22084-001-006-6848}}}When they cooked in the gateway building and on the terrace, the Blessed One said, “You should not cook in the gateway building or on the terrace. Monks, the following ten are unsuitable as places for what is allowable. You should not prepare food in these places. What are the ten? The open air, a gateway building, a terrace, a steam-bath house, a bath house, a kings’ place, a place where there are stūpas, places of those who belong to a different faith, a householders’ place, and nunneries. These ten are unsuitable places wherein a monk should not prepare food. If he prepares it there, he becomes guilty of an offense.” {{page:{number:746,id:UT22084-001-006-8575,folio:F.24.a,volume:V3}}}

{{milestone:{label:10.2,id:UT22084-001-006-6856}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:10.3,id:UT22084-001-006-6857}}}There once was a sick monk in Śrāvastī. He requested a doctor, “Sir, prescribe medicine for me.”
Having asked the cause of the disease, the doctor said, “O noble one, have rice soup, and you will recover your health.”
{{milestone:{label:10.4,id:UT22084-001-006-6859}}}“Sir,” he replied, “the Blessed One has not authorized that.”
“O noble one,” said the doctor, “since your Teacher is compassionate, it is likely that he will authorize it on this occasion.”
{{milestone:{label:10.5,id:UT22084-001-006-6861}}}He related this matter to other monks, and then those monks reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “If a doctor tells you to have rice soup, you can have rice soup as the doctor has prescribed. You should not have any regrets about this.”
{{milestone:{label:10.6,id:UT22084-001-006-6862}}}When the Blessed One said, “You can have rice soup as the doctor has prescribed,” the sick monk’s attendant brought cold rice soup and gave it to him. Thereupon the doctor came and asked, “O noble one, are you well?”
“Sir, I am not well,” he answered.
{{milestone:{label:10.7,id:UT22084-001-006-6864}}}“Did you not have rice soup?”
“I did.”
{{milestone:{label:10.8,id:UT22084-001-006-6866}}}“How did you have it?”
“I had it cold.”
{{milestone:{label:10.9,id:UT22084-001-006-6868}}}“O noble one, it wasn’t good to do that. Tomorrow, have some that’s warm.”
Then the attendant received rice soup again. Having obtained some that was cold, he heated it and gave it to the sick monk. When the doctor came and asked in the same way, he answered, “I am not well.”
{{milestone:{label:10.10,id:UT22084-001-006-6870}}}“Did you not have rice soup?”
“I did.”
{{milestone:{label:10.11,id:UT22084-001-006-6872}}}“How did you have it?”
“I had it after heating some that was cold.”
{{milestone:{label:10.12,id:UT22084-001-006-6874}}}“O noble one, it wasn’t good to do that. Since that food had been cold and was heated, tomorrow have some that is warm from the beginning.”
{{milestone:{label:10.13,id:UT22084-001-006-6875}}}“Then the attendant, having procured rice and a pot, began to cook the rice under a tree outside the monastery. {{page:{number:747,id:UT22084-001-006-8576,folio:F.24.b,volume:V3}}} However, the food was ruined by a crow’s excrement, and the monk’s condition became worse. He related this matter to other monks, and those monks reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “Monks, in such a case, you can demarcate a place for what is allowable.”
{{milestone:{label:10.14,id:UT22084-001-006-6877}}}When the Blessed One said that they could demarcate a place for what is allowable, the monks did not know what such a place was and how large it should be. The Blessed One said, “Places for what is allowable are fivefold:{{note:{index1078,id:UT22084-001-006-6878}}} those related to erecting, those related to drawing attention, those like cowsheds, empty places, and those demarcated.
{{milestone:{label:10.15,id:UT22084-001-006-6879}}}“Among these, those related to erecting are as follows: When dwellings are built, there the monk in charge of construction{{note:{index1079,id:UT22084-001-006-6880}}} first says, ‘This place will become the community’s place for what is allowable,’ making up his mind and performing the recitation. This is a place for what is allowable related to erecting.
{{milestone:{label:10.16,id:UT22084-001-006-6881}}}“What are those related to drawing attention? When a stone is first set, the monk in charge of construction says to the neighboring monks, ‘Venerable ones, understand that this place will become the community’s place for what is allowable.’ Since the word ‘understand’ is said, this is called one related to drawing attention.
{{milestone:{label:10.17,id:UT22084-001-006-6882}}}“What are those like cowsheds? Those where there are separate doors are called ones like cowsheds.
{{milestone:{label:10.18,id:UT22084-001-006-6883}}}“What are empty places? Places that have been abandoned are called empty places.
“What are those demarcated? They have been demarcated with a formal act consisting of one motion and one proclamation.”
{{milestone:{label:10.19,id:UT22084-001-006-6885}}}Since the monks did not know how to demarcate those, the Blessed One instructed them:{{note:{index1080,id:UT22084-001-006-6886}}} “If the community wishes, a place all forms of which are well fixed, which is within the boundary, and which has a fathom of space outside should be demarcated.

This place, all forms of which are well fixed, which is within the boundary, and which has a fathom of space outside, will be demarcated as the community’s place for what is allowable. If it is the right time for the community and the community permits it, may the community consent to demarcating this place . . .{{note:{index1081,id:UT22084-001-006-6887}}} as the community’s place for what is allowable.’ This is the motion.

This place . . .{{note:{index1082,id:UT22084-001-006-6889}}} is wished to be demarcated as the community’s place for what is allowable. If this place . . .{{note:{index1083,id:UT22084-001-006-6890}}} is to be demarcated by the community as the community’s place for what is allowable, those among you, venerable ones, who consent to demarcating this place . . .{{note:{index1084,id:UT22084-001-006-6891}}} as the community’s place for what is allowable should remain silent.

{{milestone:{label:10.24,id:UT22084-001-006-6899}}}There lived a general named Siṃha in Vaiśālī. His neighbors {{page:{number:749,id:UT22084-001-006-8578,folio:F.25.b,volume:V3}}} used to bring him meat, which he would eat. After he had seen the truth in the presence of the Blessed One, he did not eat meat but had what was brought to him given to monks. When the monks ate it, non-Buddhist ascetics criticized, insulted, and disparaged them: “Sirs, although we have procured meat for the general Siṃha and brought it, he did not eat it but gave it to the śramaṇas, the sons of the Śākyans. The śramaṇas, the sons of the Śākyans, ate the meat intentionally procured.”
{{milestone:{label:10.25,id:UT22084-001-006-6900}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “I said that meat that is unallowable for three reasons should not be eaten. What are the three? I said that meat that was actually seen by oneself to have been procured for oneself is unallowable meat and should not be eaten; meat about which one has heard from someone reliable, ‘This has been procured for you,’ is unallowable meat and should not be eaten; and meat, about which a conjecture such as ‘This may have been procured for me by some means’ comes to one’s mind, is unallowable meat and should not be eaten.

{{milestone:{label:10.45,id:UT22084-001-006-6930}}}Pious brahmins and householders offered lotuses to monks when they had finished having their meal. Although the monks wished to eat them, they did not because they had some doubts, thinking that they had finished their meal. When the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You can eat them with the thought that they are difficult to obtain. You should not have any regrets about this. Here, the types of lotus are as follows: roots of utpala, roots of padma, seeds of kumuda, and seeds of padma.”

{{milestone:{label:10.46,id:UT22084-001-006-6931}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:10.47,id:UT22084-001-006-6932}}}The venerable Śāriputra’s bodily elements became unbalanced, and thus his blood and phlegm were disturbed. The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, who was attending him, thought, “Although I have attended the venerable Śāriputra at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a doctor for advice. Now I will ask for advice.”{{note:{index1094,id:UT22084-001-006-6933}}} He requested a doctor, “Sir, since the venerable Śāriputra’s blood and phlegm are disturbed, prescribe medicine for him.”
{{milestone:{label:10.48,id:UT22084-001-006-6934}}}“O noble one,” answered the doctor, “offer him bisakṣīla, and he will recover his health.”
{{milestone:{label:10.49,id:UT22084-001-006-6935}}}The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana thought, “If I attend the venerable Śāriputra with the juice of ordinary padma roots, {{page:{number:753,id:UT22084-001-006-8582,folio:F.27.b,volume:V3}}} that would not be right of me.” He entered a state of meditation through which, settling his mind, he disappeared from Śrāvastī, went to the bank of a lotus pond called Mandākinī, and approached the residence of the nāga king Supratiṣṭhita. The nāga king Supratiṣṭhita saw him and asked, “O noble one, for what business have you come?”
{{milestone:{label:10.50,id:UT22084-001-006-6936}}}He replied, “The venerable Śāriputra’s blood and phlegm are disturbed, and a doctor prescribed the juice of padma roots for him.”
“O noble one, then please wait for a moment,” said the nāga king Supratiṣṭhita.
{{milestone:{label:10.51,id:UT22084-001-006-6938}}}He then dove into Mandākinī Lotus Pond, pulled out some padma roots that were as large as a human, squeezed out the juice of the padma roots onto a padma leaf, and filled the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s bowl. The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana examined the crushed padma roots. The nāga king Supratiṣṭhita asked him, “O noble one, what are you looking at? Do you wish me to give you the padma roots?”
{{milestone:{label:10.52,id:UT22084-001-006-6939}}}He remained silent. The nāga king said, “O noble one, please depart, and I will send them.”
{{milestone:{label:10.53,id:UT22084-001-006-6940}}}Thereupon the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, carrying the bowl filled with the juice of the padma roots, disappeared from the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond and went to the Jetavana, the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī. The venerable Śāriputra then drank the juice of the padma roots as the doctor had prescribed, and his health returned.
{{milestone:{label:10.54,id:UT22084-001-006-6941}}}The nāga king Supratiṣṭhita ordered the elephant Wearing a Black Costume, “Carry these padma roots, go to the Jetavana near Śrāvastī, and leave them in the yard of the monastery.” The elephant went as fast as the wind to the monastery in the Jetavana near Śrāvastī, put the padma roots in the yard, and returned. On the way home, it mated with a she-elephant in the forest. {{page:{number:754,id:UT22084-001-006-8583,folio:F.28.a,volume:V3}}} Later, the she-elephant bore an elephant calf. As soon as it was born, it gave a lion’s roar. Frightened, the she-elephant defecated, urinated, and ran away, abandoning the elephant calf. Then a certain carpenter living in Rājagṛha went to the forest to cut some trees and saw the elephant calf. He took it home and fed it. As it was protected (pālita) with wealth (dhana), the elephant calf was named Dhanapālaka.{{note:{index1095,id:UT22084-001-006-6942}}}

Then, after having thrown them away, the monks wished to eat them, but they did not, considering that they had thrown them away. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, divine padma roots are difficult for humans to obtain. Therefore, I authorize you to eat them with the thought that they are padma roots that are difficult to obtain. You should not have any regrets about this.”

{{milestone:{label:10.57,id:UT22084-001-006-6949}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:10.58,id:UT22084-001-006-6950}}}At that time, there lived six people who were famous in the city of Bhadraṃkara for their great merit: namely, a householder named Miṇḍhaka and his wife, son, daughter-in-law, male slave, and female slave.
{{milestone:{label:10.59,id:UT22084-001-006-6951}}}How was the householder Miṇḍhaka famous for his great merit? If he looked at empty storehouses, they became full as soon as he looked at them. Thus the householder Miṇḍhaka was famous for his great merit.
{{milestone:{label:10.60,id:UT22084-001-006-6952}}}And Miṇḍhaka’s wife? If she cooked for one person, the food became servings for a hundred or a thousand people.{{note:{index1098,id:UT22084-001-006-6953}}} Such was Miṇḍhaka’s wife.
{{milestone:{label:10.61,id:UT22084-001-006-6954}}}And Miṇḍhaka’s son? To his waist was tied a purse containing five hundred coins. {{page:{number:755,id:UT22084-001-006-8584,folio:F.28.b,volume:V3}}} When he had spent a hundred or a thousand, it became full just as it had been and never became empty. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s son. 
{{milestone:{label:10.62,id:UT22084-001-006-6955}}}And Miṇḍhaka’s daughter-in-law? If she prepared incense for one person, a hundred or a thousand people were satisfied. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s daughter-in-law.
{{milestone:{label:10.63,id:UT22084-001-006-6956}}}And Miṇḍhaka’s male slave? When he plowed a furrow in a field, seven furrows were plowed in the field. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s male slave.
{{milestone:{label:10.64,id:UT22084-001-006-6957}}}And Miṇḍhaka’s female slave famous for her great merit? When she hulled some grain in a mortar, it became sevenfold. Thus Miṇḍhaka’s female slave was famous for her great merit.
{{milestone:{label:10.65,id:UT22084-001-006-6958}}}At a certain point the Blessed One, knowing it was the time to convert the householder Miṇḍhaka, said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and announce to the monks, ‘Monks, the Tathāgata will travel through the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara. Those among you who will travel in the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara with the Tathāgata should take their robes.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:10.66,id:UT22084-001-006-6959}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One, and he said to the monks, “O venerable ones, the Blessed One will travel through the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara. Those among you who will travel in the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara with the Tathāgata should take their robes.”
“Certainly, O venerable one,” replied the monks to the venerable Ānanda.
{{milestone:{label:10.67,id:UT22084-001-006-6961}}}Thereupon the Blessed One traveled through the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara, himself self-controlled and his assembly self-controlled, himself pacified and his assembly pacified, himself an arhat and his assembly arhats.
{{milestone:{label:10.68,id:UT22084-001-006-6962}}}When the Blessed One had shown a great miracle in Śrāvastī, the non-Buddhist ascetics had gone to the borderlands, and some of them had gone to the city of Bhadraṃkara and {{page:{number:756,id:UT22084-001-006-8585,folio:F.29.a,volume:V3}}} settled there. When they heard that the śramaṇa Gautama was coming, they panicked and thought, “We were once expelled from the midland region by the śramaṇa Gautama. Since, if he comes here, we will certainly be expelled from here too, we must devise a plan regarding this.” They went to the houses that had provided them meals and said, “May the Dharma be attained! May the Dharma be attained!”{{note:{index1099,id:UT22084-001-006-6963}}}
{{milestone:{label:10.69,id:UT22084-001-006-6964}}}“O noble ones, what’s wrong?”
“Farewell, we are going.”{{note:{index1100,id:UT22084-001-006-6966}}}
{{milestone:{label:10.70,id:UT22084-001-006-6967}}}“Why?”
“Since we have seen your prosperity, we will leave before we see your decline.”
{{milestone:{label:10.71,id:UT22084-001-006-6969}}}“O noble ones, what decline will there be for us?”
“Sirs, the śramaṇa Gautama will come, causing hail like razors and making many people sonless or husbandless.”
{{milestone:{label:10.72,id:UT22084-001-006-6971}}}“O noble ones, if that is the case, are you abandoning us at the very moment when you should stay? Please stay. Please do not leave.”
“Why should we stay? You are incapable of listening to us,” they said.
{{milestone:{label:10.73,id:UT22084-001-006-6973}}}“O noble ones, please tell us. We will listen to you.”
“Sirs,” they said, “flush out all the people near the city of Bhadraṃkara from their houses and lead them into the city of Bhadraṃkara. Cut the green grass. Destroy their residences. Cut down trees that bear flowers and fruits. Pour poison in the water.”
{{milestone:{label:10.74,id:UT22084-001-006-6975}}}“O noble ones,” they replied, “please stay and we will do all of that.”
They then did flush out all the people near the city of Bhadraṃkara from their houses and led them into the city of Bhadraṃkara, cut the green grass, destroyed residences, cut down the flower and fruit trees, and poured poison in the water.
{{milestone:{label:10.75,id:UT22084-001-006-6977}}}Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, “It would not be right for me to ignore disrespectful acts done against the Blessed One. {{page:{number:757,id:UT22084-001-006-8586,folio:F.29.b,volume:V3}}} The Blessed One has attained supreme wisdom because he completed the six perfections through hundreds of thousands of austerities for three incalculably long eons. Should that Blessed One, who is excellent throughout the whole world, travel in an empty country?{{note:{index1101,id:UT22084-001-006-6978}}} I will now strive for the comfort of the Blessed One together with the community of disciples.”

{{milestone:{label:10.77,id:UT22084-001-006-6980}}}He ordered the sons of the gods who cause rain, “Fill the places they have dried up with water with the eight good qualities.”
{{milestone:{label:10.78,id:UT22084-001-006-6981}}}He also ordered the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, “Lead people to live near the city of Bhadraṃkara.”
{{milestone:{label:10.79,id:UT22084-001-006-6982}}}Thereupon the sons of the gods who send wind dried up the poisoned waters. The sons of the gods who cause rain filled those places with water with the eight good qualities. The gods attendant on the Four Great Kings led people to live near the city of Bhadraṃkara, and the country became prosperous.
{{milestone:{label:10.80,id:UT22084-001-006-6983}}}The non-Buddhist ascetics gathered people who had lived in the city of Bhadraṃkara and sent spies to see how the country was. They went and saw that the country was very prosperous. They returned and said, “Sirs, we have never seen the country in such prosperity.”
{{milestone:{label:10.81,id:UT22084-001-006-6984}}}“Sirs, do you see?” replied the non-Buddhist ascetics. “Will he who converts even the land not convert you too? We bid you our final farewell. This will be the last we see of you. We are leaving.”
{{milestone:{label:10.82,id:UT22084-001-006-6985}}}“O noble ones, please stay,” they implored them. “What harm will the śramaṇa Gautama do to you? He is a mendicant, and you are mendicants who live on alms, too. {{page:{number:758,id:UT22084-001-006-8587,folio:F.30.a,volume:V3}}} Why would he prevent you from begging for alms?”
{{milestone:{label:10.83,id:UT22084-001-006-6986}}}The non-Buddhist ascetics said, “We will stay if you promise us to make an agreement that none of you will go to see the śramaṇa Gautama, and that if anyone goes, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed on him.”
They agreed and made that promise.
{{milestone:{label:10.84,id:UT22084-001-006-6988}}}Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country, arrived in due course at the city of Bhadraṃkara, and stayed in a certain place south of Bhadraṃkara. At that time, a daughter of a brahmin in Kapilavastu was living in Bhadraṃkara after her marriage. Standing on a wall, she saw the Blessed One in the dark and thought, “This is that Blessed One, the joy of the lineage of the Śākyans, who abandoned the throne belonging to the lineage of the Śākyans and went forth. If I had a ladder here, I would descend, holding a lamp.”
{{milestone:{label:10.85,id:UT22084-001-006-6989}}}Then the Blessed One, knowing her mind with his own mind, created a ladder. Pleased in her mind, delighted, and gratified, she descended the ladder, holding a lamp, and went to the Blessed One. When she arrived, she put the lamp in front of the Blessed One, bowed low until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and sat down to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew her thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her and that caused her to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. . . . “I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge.”
{{milestone:{label:10.86,id:UT22084-001-006-6990}}}The Blessed One then said to the girl, “Girl, now you should go to the householder Miṇḍhaka. When you have arrived, greet him on my behalf and say, ‘Householder, it is for your sake that I have come here, but you keep your door shut. Is it appropriate to act in such a manner as you do to a guest?’ If {{page:{number:759,id:UT22084-001-006-8588,folio:F.30.b,volume:V3}}} he says that the group of people has made an agreement, say, ‘To your son’s waist is tied a purse containing five hundred coins. When he has spent a hundred or a thousand, it becomes just as it was and never becomes empty. Why can you not pay the sixty kārṣāpaṇas and come?’ ”
{{milestone:{label:10.87,id:UT22084-001-006-6991}}}“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the girl, who then departed. The Blessed One exercised his magical power so that she went to the householder Miṇḍhaka without being noticed by anyone. When she arrived, she said, “O householder, the Blessed One greets you.”
“Girl, I bow to the Buddha, the Blessed One,” he replied.
{{milestone:{label:10.88,id:UT22084-001-006-6993}}}“O householder, the Blessed One said, ‘For your sake I have come here, but you keep your door shut. Is it reasonable to act in such a manner as you do to a guest?’ ”
{{milestone:{label:10.89,id:UT22084-001-006-6994}}}“Girl,” he replied, “people have made an agreement and made a promise that no one should go to see the śramaṇa Gautama, and that if anyone goes, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed on him.”
{{milestone:{label:10.90,id:UT22084-001-006-6995}}}“O householder, the Blessed One said, ‘To your son’s waist is tied a purse containing five hundred coins.

He thought, “Since no one knows this, he, the Blessed One, must be omniscient. I will go.”
{{milestone:{label:10.91,id:UT22084-001-006-6997}}}He put sixty kārṣāpaṇas at his door, descended the ladder as the brahmin girl had told him, and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew the householder Miṇḍhaka’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and {{page:{number:760,id:UT22084-001-006-8589,folio:F.31.a,volume:V3}}} preached the Dharma that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. Having heard it, the householder Miṇḍhaka . . . actualized the fruit of stream-entry.
{{milestone:{label:10.92,id:UT22084-001-006-6998}}}Having seen the truth, he asked, “O Blessed One, will these people living in Bhadraṃkara attain such good qualities?”
“Householder,” the Blessed One answered, “it depends on you whether many people will do so.”
{{milestone:{label:10.93,id:UT22084-001-006-7000}}}Thereupon the householder Miṇḍhaka bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence. He went home, arranged a mountain of kārṣāpaṇas in the middle of the city, and spoke a verse:

“It will be good,” he answered.

{{milestone:{label:10.97,id:UT22084-001-006-7005}}}They broke the agreement and began to leave. They jostled one another, however, and were not able to go out. The yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, out of compassion for these people to be led, hurled his vajra and broke the wall, allowing hundreds of thousands of beings to go out, some prompted by curiosity and others spurred by their previous roots of merit. Many people gathered and sat down in an area of one yojana around the Blessed One.

“O Blessed One, what is appropriate after the mealtime?” he asked.

{{milestone:{label:10.102,id:UT22084-001-006-7015}}}They prepared the khādyaka to be eaten after the mealtime.

Although they wished to eat it as they were fatigued from traveling, they did not because of some doubts. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, since it would be insubstantial as a meal, you may eat some that has been put in rice after shaking the rice grains off {{page:{number:763,id:UT22084-001-006-8592,folio:F.32.b,volume:V3}}} and some that has been put in barley groats after washing it in water.”

At that time people collect bones, boil them until they become white, {{page:{number:764,id:UT22084-001-006-8593,folio:F.33.a,volume:V3}}} and then drink the liquid. As this type of famine is related to white bones, it is called ‘white bones.’ What is ‘living by means of a stick’?

{{milestone:{label:11.5,id:UT22084-001-006-7099}}}Thereupon the Blessed One entertained mundane thoughts. It naturally occurs that when the buddhas, the blessed ones, entertain mundane thoughts, Śakra, Brahmā, and other gods understand the Blessed One’s thoughts. Great King Vaiśravaṇa asked himself, {{page:{number:769,id:UT22084-001-006-8598,folio:F.35.b,volume:V3}}} “For the sake of what did the Blessed One entertain mundane thoughts?” He then realized, “He wishes to preach the Dharma to us, the Four Protectors of the World.” Having realized this, he ordered Pāñcika,{{note:{index1128,id:UT22084-001-006-7100}}} the great general of the yakṣas, “Pāñcika, go and prepare a seat for the Blessed One on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond.

{{milestone:{label:11.6,id:UT22084-001-006-7101}}}Having installed a guard for the ṛṣi Kaineya on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond, he was preparing a seat for the Blessed One when the sound of many people arose. Because of the noise, the ṛṣi Kaineya stood up and asked the guard, “What is this noise?”
“They are preparing a seat,” he answered.

“Who could guard that Blessed One?” answered the guard. “The Blessed One himself is the guard of the world including gods.”
When he heard this, the ṛṣi Kaineya remained silent.
{{milestone:{label:11.11,id:UT22084-001-006-7113}}}The Blessed One then dressed in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Ādumā for alms. After having begged for food, he had his meal. Afterward he returned, settled his mind, and entered a state of meditation by which he disappeared from Ādumā with the community of monks and appeared on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond.

{{milestone:{label:11.30,id:UT22084-001-006-7148}}}The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did the Four Great Kings create that matured to cause them to become the Four Great Kings and see the truths in the presence of the Blessed One?”

{{milestone:{label:11.32,id:UT22084-001-006-7151}}}“Monks, at a certain point in this fortunate eon, when people’s lifespans were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa, who was . . . a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. At that time, there lived in the great ocean two nāgas named Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa. There were two garuḍas named Aṭṭeśvara and Cūḍeśvara on a kūṭaśālmalī tree. Whenever these two attacked Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa, the two nāgas escaped underground. Later, after Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa had sought refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accepted the rules of training, the garuḍas again began to attack these two, but they were obstructed and repulsed, just as wind and water are obstructed and repulsed by Mount Sumeru. The two garuḍas then inquired of them, ‘Sirs, when we attacked you before, you used to escape underground. Why, when we meet you now, are we obstructed and repulsed, just as wind and water are obstructed and repulsed by Mount Sumeru? What is the cause of this?’
{{milestone:{label:11.33,id:UT22084-001-006-7152}}}“Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa {{page:{number:774,id:UT22084-001-006-8603,folio:F.38.a,volume:V3}}} answered, ‘We sought refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accepted the rules of training.’

{{milestone:{label:11.34,id:UT22084-001-006-7154}}}“The two garuḍas then went to the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa with the two nāgas. When they arrived, they saw the Four Protectors of the World depart after they had heard the Dharma in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. The two garuḍas asked the two nāgas, Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa, ‘Who are those ones departing?’ 
{{milestone:{label:11.35,id:UT22084-001-006-7155}}}“The two nāgas explained about this in detail, and the two garuḍas replied, ‘If that is the case, we will also seek refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, accept the rules of training, and make aspirations.’ The two garuḍas then did seek refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accept the rules of training. Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa had already accepted them before. Then they together threw themselves at the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and made these aspirations: ‘Just as these Four Protectors of the World, after having heard the Dharma in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, saw the truths and departed for their residences, may we also, by this root of merit, become the Four Protectors of the World! May that Blessed One, whom a young brahmin called Uttara was predicted to become{{note:{index1145,id:UT22084-001-006-7156}}} by the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa—“Young brahmin, you will become a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one called Śākyamuni when people’s lifespans are a hundred years long”—preach the Dharma for us on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond!

{{milestone:{label:11.191,id:UT22084-001-006-7352}}}The son then invited the community of monks. The father went to the market, carrying a mirror with him. There he saw the head of a guild, who had long hair and a long beard. When he showed him the mirror, he asked, “O noble one, do you have such a skill?” {{page:{number:791,id:UT22084-001-006-8620,folio:F.46.b,volume:V3}}}
{{milestone:{label:11.192,id:UT22084-001-006-7353}}}“Yes, I do,” he answered.
“If you do, please shave me.”
{{milestone:{label:11.193,id:UT22084-001-006-7355}}}When he began to shave him, the householder fell asleep and woke up when the shaving was done. “O noble one,” he asked, “have you finished shaving?”
“Yes, householder, I have.”
{{milestone:{label:11.194,id:UT22084-001-006-7357}}}He was delighted and said, “O noble one, as I am quite completely satisfied, I will offer you what you most wish.”
He replied, “Since I have invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal of barley porridge, give me barley porridge.”
{{milestone:{label:11.195,id:UT22084-001-006-7359}}}“Noble one, is such a thing as barley porridge suitable for you?” the householder asked. “I will offer you a fine meal. Go and invite them!”
Having saluted him, he departed.
{{milestone:{label:11.196,id:UT22084-001-006-7361}}}Then the householder prepared a pure and fine meal . . . the Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When the fine meal was distributed there, the monks wondered, “Since we have been invited for plain food, how can we accept this fine meal?” They did not accept it. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If one is invited for plain food and obtains a fine meal, one can consume it. You should not have any doubts about this.”
{{milestone:{label:11.197,id:UT22084-001-006-7362}}}The Blessed One thought, “The fault that occurred in this case was that monks retain tools related to their families. Thus, a monk should not demonstrate his skill. He should not keep tools related to his family, either. If he keeps them, he becomes guilty of an offense. There are exceptions: a former physician keeping a box of scalpels, a former scribe keeping an ink bottle, and a tailor keeping a needle case.”{{note:{index1178,id:UT22084-001-006-7363}}}

{{milestone:{label:11.198,id:UT22084-001-006-7364}}}The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Malla, arrived at Pāpā and stayed in the dense forest of Jalūkā near Pāpā. There lived a maternal uncle of the venerable Ānanda, who was a high official of the Mallas named Roca. He was not very pious. When the Mallas in Pāpā{{note:{index1179,id:UT22084-001-006-7365}}} heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Malla, had arrived at Pāpā and was staying in the dense forest of Jalūkā near Pāpā, {{page:{number:792,id:UT22084-001-006-8621,folio:F.47.a,volume:V3}}} they began to talk among themselves: “Sirs, we have heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Malla, has arrived at Pāpā and is staying in the dense forest of Jalūkā near Pāpā. Since if each of us offers a meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha, the others will not have any opportunity, let us make an agreement so that none of us will by himself offer a meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha, but we will offer a meal together. If one of us offers a meal by himself, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed on him by our community.”
{{milestone:{label:11.199,id:UT22084-001-006-7366}}}Thereupon the Mallas of Pāpā went to the Blessed One together. When they arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma . . . delighted the Mallas of Pāpā, and then remained silent.
{{milestone:{label:11.200,id:UT22084-001-006-7367}}}Thereupon the Mallas of Pāpā rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal at one of our houses tomorrow.”
{{milestone:{label:11.201,id:UT22084-001-006-7368}}}The Blessed One assented to the Mallas of Pāpā by remaining silent. Then the Mallas of Pāpā, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, praised and were delighted at the words of the Blessed One, bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from their seats, and departed.
{{milestone:{label:11.202,id:UT22084-001-006-7369}}}Roca, the high official of the Mallas, remained there. The venerable Ānanda asked him, “Roca, {{page:{number:793,id:UT22084-001-006-8622,folio:F.47.b,volume:V3}}} have you become pious?”
“I have not become pious,” he answered, “but our community made an agreement . . . a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed.”

Upon their arrival, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, this Roca, the high official of the Mallas, does not believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, or the community. May the Blessed One preach the Dharma well so that he will believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community.”
{{milestone:{label:11.205,id:UT22084-001-006-7375}}}The Blessed One assented to the venerable Ānanda by remaining silent. Then the Blessed One preached the Dharma to Roca, the high official of the Mallas, so that after listening to it, he would believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community. Thereupon Roca, the high official of the Mallas, rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”
“Roca, I have already been invited by the Mallas of Pāpā.”
{{milestone:{label:11.206,id:UT22084-001-006-7377}}}“May the Blessed One assent, and I will make the Mallas of Pāpā allow this.”

It will not cause difficulty if I first offer a meal to the Blessed One and the community of monks, and later you also offer a meal to them.”

Those who were impious there said, “We do not permit this.”

{{milestone:{label:11.217,id:UT22084-001-006-7396}}}The following took place in Śrāvastī.
{{milestone:{label:11.218,id:UT22084-001-006-7397}}}A certain householder invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha to a steam bath. At that time, a venerable one named Svāti, who was young, junior, and in his youth, who had newly gone forth and newly been ordained, newly come into this Dharma and Vinaya, thought, “The Blessed One said, ‘Those who give a little, those who give much, those who give excellent things, those who do labor with pleasure, those who are satisfied with a pure mind—all of them share merit.’ So, I will now do labor.” He began to chop wood. Then a poisonous snake emerged from a hole in a rotten piece of wood and bit him on the right big toe. He fainted from the poison, fell on the ground, and foamed at the mouth, his face and eyes distorted. 
{{milestone:{label:11.219,id:UT22084-001-006-7398}}}Brahmins and householders saw him suffering in such pain and asked each other, “Sirs, which householder’s son is this?” 
Some of them answered, “He is So-and-so’s son.” 
{{milestone:{label:11.220,id:UT22084-001-006-7400}}}They said, “He went forth among those who are helpless, those śramaṇas who are the sons of the Śākyans. {{page:{number:796,id:UT22084-001-006-8625,folio:F.49.a,volume:V3}}} If he had not gone forth, his family would have treated him.”
{{milestone:{label:11.221,id:UT22084-001-006-7401}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Ask a physician what to do and treat him.”
The monks asked a physician what to do, and he answered, “Noble ones, give him some foul food.”
{{milestone:{label:11.222,id:UT22084-001-006-7403}}}When the monks reported this to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You can give it to him if the physician prescribed it.”
Because the monks did not know what foul food was, they asked the physician. He answered, “Noble ones, since your Teacher, the Blessed One, is omniscient, one who sees everything, he must know.”
{{milestone:{label:11.223,id:UT22084-001-006-7405}}}When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, the types of foul food are as follows: excrement, urine, ash, and soil. Among these, excrement is that of newly born calves. Urine is that of them too. Ash is that of five kinds of trees, namely, kāñcana, kapītaka, aśvattha, udumbara, and nyagrodha. The soil is that which is dug out from a depth of four fingers from the surface of the ground. These are the types of foul food.”
{{milestone:{label:11.224,id:UT22084-001-006-7406}}}Thereupon the monks gave foul food to the venerable Svāti, but his health did not return. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Ānanda, can you receive the Great Peacock Charm from me, learn it, protect, guard, and defend the monk Svāti, detoxify the poison, remove the harm, counteract the poison, establish a boundary, and bind the ground?”
“May the Blessed One say it. I will do as I hear.” 
{{milestone:{label:11.225,id:UT22084-001-006-7408}}}Then the Blessed One chanted this Great Peacock Charm: “Homage to the Buddha! {{page:{number:797,id:UT22084-001-006-8626,folio:F.49.b,volume:V3}}} Homage to the Dharma! Homage to the community!

{{milestone:{label:11.228,id:UT22084-001-006-7414}}}The monks, feeling doubtful, asked the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, for clarification, saying: “O Blessed One, it is a great wonder that the Blessed One’s Great Peacock Charm is so beneficial{{note:{index1186,id:UT22084-001-006-7415}}} and useful.”

Having fallen into his antagonists’ hands, he fainted but later came to himself and reflected upon this Great Peacock Charm, namely: Amale vimale nirmale maṅgale hiraṇye hiraṇye garbhe bhadre subhadre samanta­bhadre śrībhadre sarvārtha­sādhani paramārtha­sādhani sarvānartha­praśamani sarva­maṅgala­sādhani manasi mānasi mahā­mānasi acyute adbhute atyadbhute mukte mocani mokṣaṇi araje viraje amare amṛte amaraṇi brahme brahmāsvare pūrṇe pūrṇamanorathe mukte jīvante, protect me from every harm, svāhā!

“See, O Honored One, how a blessing was given to the monk Svāti with the Blessed One’s charm.”
