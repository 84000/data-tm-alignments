{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-029-001-205}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Lord dwelt at Rājagṛha on Gṛdhrakūṭa Hill together with a great community of monks, numbering five thousand monks, all worthy ones with the exception of one single person—that is, venerable Ānanda—with outflows dried up, without afflictions, fully controlled, with their minds well freed and their wisdom well freed, thoroughbreds, great bull elephants, with their work done, their task accomplished, with their burden laid down, with their own goal accomplished, with the fetters that bound them to existence broken, with their hearts well freed by perfect understanding, in perfect control of their whole mind;  with nuns numbering five hundred—Yaśodharā, Mahāprajāpatī, and so on—and with a great many laymen and laywomen, all of them with a vision of the Dharma; and with an unbounded, infinite number of bodhisattva great beings, all of whom had acquired the dhāraṇīs, were dwellers in emptiness, their range the signless, and who had not fashioned any wishes, had acquired forbearance for the sameness of all dharmas, had acquired the dhāraṇī of nonattachment, with imperishable clairvoyant knowledges, and with speech worth listening to; who were not hypocrites, not fawners, without thoughts of reputation and gain; who were Dharma teachers without thought of compensation, with perfect forbearance for the deep dharmas, who had obtained the fearlessnesses, and who had transcended all the works of Māra, who had cut the continuum of karmic obscuration, were skillful in expounding the analysis of investigations into phenomena, with the prayer that is a vow made during an asaṃkhyeya of eons really fully carried out, with smiling countenances, forward in addressing others, without a frown on their faces, skillful in communicating with others in chanted verse, without feelings of depression, without losing the confidence giving a readiness to speak, and endowed with fearlessness when surpassing endless assemblies; who were skilled in going forth during an ananta of one hundred million eons, understanding phenomena to be like an illusion, a mirage, a reflection of the moon in water, a dream, an echo, an apparition, a reflection in the mirror, and a magical creation; who were skillful in comprehending the thoughts, conduct, and beliefs of all beings and subtle knowledge,  with unobstructed thoughts, and endowed with extreme patience; who were skilled in causing entry into reality just as it is, having appropriated all the endless arrays of the buddhafields through prayer and setting out, with the meditative stabilization recollecting buddhas in an infinite number of world systems constantly and always activated; who were skillful in soliciting innumerable buddhas; who were skillful in eliminating the various views, propensities, obsessions, and defilements; and who were skillful in accomplishing a hundred thousand feats through meditative concentration. That is, he was together with the bodhisattva great beings Bhadrapāla, Ratnākara, Ratnagarbha, Ratnadatta, Susārthavaha, Varuṇadeva, Guhyagupta, Indradatta, Uttaramatin, Viśeṣamatin, Vardhamāna­matin, Anantamati, Amoghadarśin, Anāvaraṇamatin, Susaṃprasthita, Su­vikrānta­vikrāmin, Anantavīrya, Nityodyukta, Nityaprayukta, Anikṣiptadhura, Sūryagarbha, Anupamamatin, and Avalokiteśvara, Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, Māra­bala­pramardin, Vajramatin, Ratna­mudrā­hasta, Nityotkṣipta­hasta, Mahā­karuṇā­cinta, Mahāvyūha, Vyūharāja, and Merukūṭa, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, and many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion other bodhisattvas as well. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-029-001-11382,folio:F.2.a,volume:V29}}}{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-029-001-11383,folio:F.2.b,volume:V29}}}{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-029-001-206}}}{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-029-001-207}}}{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-029-001-209}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-029-001-210}}} Thereupon the Lord, having himself arranged the lion throne, sat down with his legs crossed, holding his body erect, intent on fixing mindfulness, and entered into the meditative stabilization, samādhirāja by name, in which all meditative stabilizations are put, included, encompassed, and come to meet.{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-029-001-11384,folio:F.3.a,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-029-001-211}}} Then the Lord, mindful and self-possessed, emerged from this meditative stabilization and surveyed with his divine eye all world systems. Having done so, he beamed with his whole body. From the wheels with a thousand spokes on the soles of his feet issued sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays, from the ten toes of his feet issued sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays, and similarly from his ankles, legs, knees, thighs, hips, and navel, from his two sides, and from the śrīvatsa mark of a great person in his heart issued sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays. From his ten fingers issued sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays. Similarly, from his two forearms, two shoulders, neck, four eyeteeth, all forty teeth, two nostrils, ears, and eyes, ūrṇā, the uṣṇīṣa on the top of his head, and from the opening of his mouth issued sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays. All these sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays pervaded the world systems in their entirety with a great illumination and lit them up. This great illumination from the light rays spread out through as many world systems in the eastern direction as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River. Similarly, this great illumination from the light rays spread out through each of as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions to the northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, below and above, and lit them up. And all the beings  who saw that light, who were touched by the illumination of those light rays, became irreversible from unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-029-001-11385,folio:F.3.b,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-029-001-212}}} Thereupon all the Lord’s hair pores became radiant. From each of the hair pores sixty sixty-one hundred thousand one hundred million billion rays issued forth, and these rays pervaded all the world systems in the great billionfold world system with a great illumination. This great illumination from the light rays spread out through as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east, pervading them with a great illumination and lighting them up. Similarly, this illumination from the light rays spread out through each of as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest, below and above, and lit them up. And all the beings who saw that light, who were touched by the illumination of those light rays, became irreversible from unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-029-001-213}}} Then the Lord, with the light from the natural splendor of a tathāgata, pervaded the great billionfold world system with a great illumination. He pervaded as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east with this great illumination, and he similarly pervaded each of as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest, below and above, with this great illumination. And all the beings who saw that light, who were touched by the illumination of those light rays, became irreversible from unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-029-001-214}}} Thereupon the Lord extended his tongue and with it covered the great billionfold world system in its entirety.  Having pervaded the great billionfold world system with his tongue, he smiled, and from his tongue again many hundred thousand one hundred million billion variously colored rays issued forth, and on all the light rays stood lotuses made of manifold precious stones, shining like gold, each with a thousand petals, variegated, beautiful, captivating, brilliant, fragrant, and soft, all completely like the kācalindika, pleasing to the touch. On the lotuses, furthermore, were seated many embodied tathāgatas, teaching Dharma—this very teaching of Dharma associated with the six perfections. They went to as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east and taught Dharma—this very teaching of Dharma associated with the perfection of wisdom—and similarly, to each of as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest, below and above, and taught Dharma—this very teaching of Dharma associated with the six perfections. And all the beings who listened to that Dharma became irreversible from unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-029-001-11386,folio:F.4.a,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-029-001-216}}} Then the Lord, seated on that very lion throne, entered into the meditative stabilization called siṃhavikrīḍita. He enacted such a performance with his miraculous power that his performance of miraculous power shook the great billionfold world system in six ways: it shook, shook greatly, and shook violently; it quaked, quaked greatly, and quaked violently; it stirred, stirred greatly, and stirred violently; it became disturbed, greatly disturbed, and violently disturbed;  it roared, roared greatly, and roared violently; and it resounded, resounded greatly, and resounded violently. At the edges it rose up and it sank down in the middle; in the middle it rose up and at the edges sank down. It became soft and oily, producing benefit and ease for all beings. Thereupon, at that moment, minute, and second, in the great billionfold world system the continuums of the hells and the animal world, and the world of Yama, were all cut. And all the places that preclude a perfect human birth disappeared. All those beings were reborn among humans, and also among the Cāturmahā­rājika, Trāyastriṃśa, Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin gods.{{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-029-001-11387,folio:F.4.b,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-029-001-217}}} Thereupon, in their great joy and rejoicing these humans and gods recalled their former lives, and having recalled them approached the Lord, bowed to his feet with their heads, cupped their palms together in a gesture of prayerful supplication, and bowed forward. And so too in each of the ten directions, in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east, to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions, and below and above, the continuums of the hells, animal worlds, and the worlds of Yama in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River were all cut too. And all the places precluding a perfect human birth disappeared. All those beings were reborn among humans and the gods. Thereupon these humans and gods recalled their former lives. In their great joy and rejoicing they then approached the buddhas in their respective buddhafields, bowed to their feet with their heads,  and with palms together in a gesture of prayerful supplication bowed forward.{{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-029-001-11388,folio:F.5.a,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-029-001-218}}} Then, in the great billionfold world system, the beings who were born blind saw forms with their eyes, the deaf heard sounds with their ears, the insane regained their senses, those with distracted thoughts became one-pointed in their thoughts, the naked found clothes, the poor found wealth, the hungry found food, the thirsty found drink, the sick were healed, the sense faculties of those with damaged sense faculties were repaired, and the physically exhausted became no longer exhausted. Those who had not given up unwholesome deeds of body, speech, and mind, and unwholesome livelihood, gave up their unwholesome habits. All beings considered every being in the same way as they considered their mother, father, brother, and sister, and as they considered their friends, kinsmen, and blood relatives. And they were endowed with the ten wholesome actions and became celibate, pure, free from the stain of immorality, and free from all unwholesome conceptualization. And at that time all beings, possessed of all happiness, acquired the ease a monk feels when absorbed in the third concentration. And at that very time they were endowed with such knowledge that they knew, “Good is charity! Good is self-discipline! Good is restraint! Good it is to observe celibacy! Good is nonviolence toward living creatures!” And at that time  the lord buddhas in other buddhafields cried out cries of delight: “Ah! It is amazing these beings are thus endowed with such knowledge that knows, ‘Good is charity! Good is self-discipline! Good is restraint! Good it is to observe celibacy! Good is nonviolence toward living creatures!’ ” {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-029-001-11389,folio:F.5.b,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-029-001-219}}} Thereupon the Lord, seated on this very lion throne, stood out towering over the great billionfold world system with Sumeru, the encircling mountain ranges, the abodes of the gods, Indra, Brahmā, Vaśavartin, Śuddhāvāsa, and the classes of gods and asuras, shining forth, gleaming, dazzling, and shedding light with his light, color, brilliance, and glory in the same way as, for example, a strong sun or the disk of a full moon in a clear sky.{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-029-001-220}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-029-001-221}}} So too the Lord stood out towering over as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east with his light, color, brilliance, and glory. Similarly the Lord stood out towering over as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions, and below and above—in each of the ten directions—shining forth, gleaming, dazzling, and shedding light with his light, color, brilliance, and glory in the same way as, for example, Sumeru, the king of mountains, stands out towering over all mountains, shining forth, gleaming, dazzling, and shedding light; or in the same way as, for example, the disk of the moon towers over all the stars, shining forth, gleaming, dazzling, and shedding light; or in the same way as, for example, the disk of the sun  stands out towering over all other lights, shining forth, gleaming, dazzling, and shedding light. So too the Lord stands out towering over world systems in the ten directions with their gods, Indras, Brahmās, Śuddhāvāsas, and the classes of gods and humans, shining forth, gleaming, dazzling, and shedding light with his light, color, brilliance, and glory.{{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-029-001-11390,folio:F.6.a,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-029-001-222}}} Thereupon the Lord exhibited an ordinary bodily form, like that of beings in the great billionfold world system. Then in the great billionfold world system all the gods, from the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa class down to the Brahmakāyika, Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin, Nirmāṇarati, Tuṣita, Yāma, Trāyastriṃśa, and Cāturmahā­rājika gods saw the body of the Tathāgata you can never see enough. Feeling contented, pleased, delighted, joyful, and joyous, with such mental happiness they took celestial flowers, celestial garlands, celestial incense, celestial creams, celestial powders, and celestial perfumes; celestial blue lotuses, lotuses, red lotuses, white lotuses, nalina lilies and saugandhaka lilies; celestial flowers, nāgavṛkṣa flowers, and tamāla leaves; and celestial robes, celestial jewelry, celestial parasols, flags, and banners and approached the Lord. Those humans to be trained, in the form of recipients seated in the great billionfold world system, saw the body of the Tathāgata you can never see enough, took land and water flowers, and approached the body of the Tathāgata you can never see enough.  Both gods and humans then strewed near, strewed in front, and strewed all around the body of the Tathāgata these celestial flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, creams, powders, robes, parasols, flags, banners, and land and water flowers. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-029-001-11391,folio:F.6.b,volume:V29}}}{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-029-001-223}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-029-001-224}}} By the sustaining power of the Lord all this rain of flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, creams, powders, robes, parasols, flags, banners, and land and water flowers that was strewed down on the Lord stayed there like a second story made of flowers and so on, with the dimensions of the great billionfold world system, in the sky right above the Lord’s head. And from this second story tassels made of celestial flowers and silk were suspended, hanging there, hanging right there, and these tassels made of celestial flowers and silk made the great billionfold world system look very beautiful. And the brightly shining golden color of the Lord streaming forth in the ten directions pervaded and lit up as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River in each direction. This thought then occurred to each of the gods and humans in all the Jambudvīpa world systems in the great billionfold world system: “The Tathāgata is seated in front of us teaching the Dharma.” Similarly, this thought occurred to the gods in the Godānīyas to the west, Videhas to the east, and Kurus to the north, to the Cāturmahā­rājika gods up to the Akaniṣṭha gods, and similarly to all thegods and humans in a thousandfold [four-continent] world system, in a millionfold world system, or in a great billionfold world system:  “The Tathāgata is seated in front of us teaching the Dharma.”{{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-029-001-11392,folio:F.7.a,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-029-001-226}}} Thereupon the Lord, seated on this very lion throne, smiled once again. Through the illumination from that smile the great billionfold world system was lit up, and all the beings seated in the great billionfold world system saw the Lord Buddha, together with his śrāvaka saṅgha, in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east. And all those beings seated in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east saw the Lord Śākyamuni, together with his community of monks, in this Sahā world system.
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-029-001-227}}} Similarly, the beings included in this Sahā world system saw the Lord Buddha, together with his śrāvaka saṅgha, in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the south, west, and north, in the intermediate directions to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest, below and above. And all those beings seated in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River as well saw this Sahā world system and the Lord Śākyamuni, together with his community of monks.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-029-001-228}}} In the east, beyond as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River, at the very limit of these world systems, there is a world system called Ratnāvatī. In it the tathāgata, worthy one, perfectly complete buddha Ratnākara now dwells and maintains himself. He teaches to the bodhisattvas this very perfection of wisdom.  Then, in that world system a bodhisattva, a great being, called Samantaraśmi saw this great illumination, this great shaking of the earth, and the body of the Lord you can never see enough, and he approached the lord Ratnākara, the tathāgata, and inquired of the tathāgata Ratnākara, “What is the cause, O Lord, what is the reason for this great illumination having manifested in the world, and for this great shaking of the earth, and for the presence of the body of the Tathāgata you can never see enough?”{{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-029-001-11393,folio:F.7.b,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-029-001-229}}} The lord Ratnākara replied to the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi, “There is, child of a good family, beyond as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River in the western direction, a world system called Sahā. There the tathāgata Śākyamuni now dwells and maintains himself, also teaching the Dharma to the bodhisattvas. This sort of thing is his power.”
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-029-001-230}}} Then the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi said to the tathāgata Ratnākara, “I will go to that Sahā world system to see, salute, and honor that tathāgata Śākyamuni, and to see those bodhisattva great beings, for the most part in the form of the young, who have acquired the dhāraṇīs and detailed and thorough knowledges and acquired mastery over all the meditative stabilizations and absorptions.”
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-029-001-231}}}The Lord replied, “Go then, child of a good family, since you feel that now is the right time.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-029-001-232}}} Thereupon the tathāgata Ratnākara gave the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi  a thousand lotuses made of manifold jewels, each with a thousand petals shining like gold, saying, “Child of a good family, strew these lotuses over the tathāgata Śākyamuni. Be on your best behavior in that buddhafield. And why? Because the bodhisattvas born in that Sahā world system are difficult to approach.” {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-029-001-11394,folio:F.8.a,volume:V29}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-029-001-233}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-029-001-234}}} Thereupon the bodhisattva Samantaraśmi received from the tathāgata Ratnākara the lotuses made of manifold jewels, each with a thousand petals shining like gold. Surrounded by, and at the head of, many hundred thousand one hundred million billion bodhisattvas, householders and renunciates, young men and women, he disappeared together with them from that buddhafield and, having respected, revered, honored, and worshiped as many lords as there are dwelling and maintaining themselves in the east with flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, creams, powders, robes, parasols, flags, and banners, arrived there in the Sahā world through that bodhisattva’s great wonder-working and that bodhisattva’s great power. He approached the tathāgata Śākyamuni, went up to him, bowed to the Lord’s feet with his head, and stood to one side. The bodhisattva Samantaraśmi then addressed the Lord, the tathāgata Śākyamuni: “The lord Ratnākara inquires about the Lord’s health, hopes that the Lord is well and free from sickness, alert and buoyant, eating well, strong, and comfortable.  The lord Ratnākara has also dispatched these lotuses for the Lord.”{{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-029-001-11395,folio:F.8.b,volume:V29}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-029-001-235}}} The lord tathāgata Śākyamuni accepted the lotuses and threw them back to the lord buddhas in as many world systems as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River to the east. Those lotuses spread throughout those world systems, and on them were seated buddha bodies. In those buddhafields they taught Dharma—this very teaching of Dharma associated with the six perfections. And the beings who heard that Dharma became certain to reach unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. Thereupon those bodhisattvas, the householders and renunciates, young men and women, each one by virtue of his or her own wholesome roots, respected, revered, honored, and worshiped the lord Śākyamuni and sat down on one side.

{{milestone:{label:3.2,id:UT22084-029-001-354}}} Venerable Śāriputra having thus inquired, the Lord said to him, “Śāriputra, here bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom do not, even while they are bodhisattvas, see a bodhisattva. They do not see even the word bodhisattva. They do not see awakening either, and they do not see the perfection of wisdom. They do not see that ‘they practice,’ and they do not see that ‘they do not practice.’ They also do not see that ‘while practicing they practice and while not practicing do not practice,’ and they also do not see that ‘they do not practice, and do not not practice as well.’ They do not see form. Similarly, they do not see feeling, perception, volitional factors, or consciousness either. And why? Because, Śāriputra, the name bodhisattva is empty of the intrinsic nature of a name. The name bodhisattva is not empty because of emptiness. A bodhisattva is also empty of the intrinsic nature of a bodhisattva, but a bodhisattva is not empty because of emptiness. Awakening, too, is empty of the intrinsic nature of awakening, but awakening is not empty because of emptiness. The perfection of wisdom, too, is empty of the intrinsic nature of the perfection of wisdom, but the perfection of wisdom is not empty because of emptiness. Form, too, is empty of the intrinsic nature of form, but form is not empty because of emptiness.  And feeling . . . perception . . . volitional factors . . . and consciousness is also empty of the intrinsic nature of consciousness, but consciousness is not empty because of emptiness. And why? Because the emptiness of the name bodhisattva is not the name bodhisattva, and there is no name bodhisattva apart from emptiness, because the name bodhisattva itself is emptiness and emptiness is the name bodhisattva as well. The emptiness of the bodhisattva is not the bodhisattva and there is no bodhisattva apart from emptiness, because the bodhisattva is emptiness and emptiness is the bodhisattva as well. The emptiness of the perfection of wisdom is not the perfection of wisdom and there is no perfection of wisdom apart from emptiness, because the perfection of wisdom itself is emptiness and emptiness is the perfection of wisdom as well. The emptiness of form is not form and there is no form apart from emptiness, because form itself is emptiness and emptiness is form as well. And the emptiness of feeling . . . perception . . . volitional factors . . . and consciousness is not consciousness, and there is no consciousness apart from emptiness because consciousness itself is emptiness and emptiness is consciousness as well. And why? Because this—namely, bodhisattva—is just a name; because these—namely, the name bodhisattva, awakening, the perfection of wisdom, form, feeling, perception, volitional factors, and consciousness—are just names; and because this—namely, emptiness—is just a name. Why? Because where there is no intrinsic nature there is no production, stopping, decrease, increase, defilement, or purification. And why? Because form is like an illusion, feeling is like an illusion, perception is like an illusion, volitional factors are like an illusion, and consciousness is like an illusion. And an illusion is just a name that does not reside somewhere, does not reside in a particular place, so the sight of an illusion is mistaken and does not exist and is devoid of an intrinsic nature. Bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom like that do not see production, do not see stopping, do not see standing, do not see decrease, do not see increase, do not see defilement, and do not see purification in any dharma at all. They do not see ‘awakening,’ and they do not see a ‘bodhisattva’ anywhere. And why? Because names are made up. In the case of each of these different dharmas they are imagined, unreal, names plucked out of thin air working subsequently as conventional labels, and just as they are subsequently conventionally labeled, so too are they settled down on as real. Bodhisattva  great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom do not see any of those names as inherently existing, and because they do not see them, they do not settle down on them as real. {{page:{number:45,id:UT22084-029-001-11425,folio:F.23.b,volume:V29}}}{{page:{number:46,id:UT22084-029-001-11426,folio:F.24.a,volume:V29}}}{{page:{number:47,id:UT22084-029-001-11427,folio:F.24.b,volume:V29}}}{{note:{index46,id:UT22084-029-001-355}}}{{note:{index47,id:UT22084-029-001-356}}}{{note:{index48,id:UT22084-029-001-357}}}{{note:{index49,id:UT22084-029-001-359}}}

And why? Lord, it is not that I do not venerate those physical remains of the tathāgatas. Lord, I do indeed venerate them. It is not that I do not respect those physical remains of the tathāgatas, or do not revere, do not honor, and do not worship them. But I respect, revere, honor, and worship those physical remains of the tathāgatas because they come about from the perfection of wisdom.

Why can it not be taken up? It is because this perfection of wisdom is not a place to be seized or not seized, to be increased or reduced, to be taken away from or added to, for defilement or purification. It does not bestow the buddha dharmas; it does not remove the dharmas of ordinary persons. It does not bestow the dharmas of bodhisattvas, the dharmas of pratyekabuddhas, the dharmas of śrāvakas, the dharmas of those in training, or the dharmas of those for whom there is no more training. It does not remove the dharmas of ordinary persons. It does not bestow the uncompounded element, and it does not remove the compounded element. It does not bestow inner emptiness, up to or the emptiness that is the nonexistence of an intrinsic nature; it does not bestow the applications of mindfulness, the right efforts, the legs of miraculous power, the faculties, the powers, the limbs of awakening, the path, or the eighteen distinct attributes of a buddha. It does not bestow the knowledge of all aspects.”

Why? Because the perfection of wisdom is not two, because a dual perfection of wisdom is not available. Similarly, a dual perfection of concentration, perfection of perseverance, perfection of patience, perfection of morality, and perfection of giving is not available, because it is not two.”{{page:{number:617,id:UT22084-029-001-11998,folio:F.10.b,volume:V30}}}

Similarly, a dual perfection of concentration . . . , perfection of perseverance . . . , perfection of patience . . . , perfection of morality . . . , and perfection of giving is not available, because it is not two. Kauśika, to accept the perfection of wisdom as two is simply to accept the dharma-constituent as two. And why? Kauśika, the perfection of wisdom and the dharma-constituent are not two, nor are they divided. Similarly, the perfection of concentration, perfection of perseverance, perfection of patience, perfection of morality, and perfection of giving and the dharma-constituent are not two, nor are they divided.

When I am not present on my lion throne they think, ‘Seated on this Dharma throne, Śatakratu, head of the gods, teaches Dharma to the Trāyastriṃśa gods,’ and they bow down to that throne of mine and go back. Similarly, Lord, the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas come from the ten directions with the thought to go and bow down to where this perfection of wisdom is kept written out, or is read aloud, or is perfectly revealed to others and, having bowed down to this perfection of wisdom, to go back. And why? It is because the tathāgatas, worthy ones, perfectly complete buddhas have come about from this perfection of wisdom, all the requirements for the happiness of all beings have arisen from it, and because whatever physical remains of the tathāgatas there are, they too have come about from this perfection of wisdom.

Lord, the perfection of wisdom provides security because it has eliminated all hazards, terrors, and persecution.

Lord, the perfection of wisdom is the mother of great bodhisattvas because she gives birth to all the buddhadharmas.

{{milestone:{label:44.1,id:UT22084-029-001-3871}}}Then venerable Subhūti said to the Lord, “Lord, this perfection of wisdom is deep. Lord, this perfection of wisdom has been made available through tremendous work. This perfection of wisdom has been made available through incomparable work, immeasurable work, incalculable work,  work equal to the unequaled.”{{page:{number:884,id:UT22084-029-001-12265,folio:F.144.a,volume:V30}}}
{{milestone:{label:44.2,id:UT22084-029-001-3872}}}Venerable Subhūti having said this, the Lord replied to him, “Exactly so, Subhūti, exactly so! Subhūti, this perfection of wisdom has been made available through tremendous work. This perfection of wisdom has been made available through incomparable work, immeasurable work, incalculable work, work equal to the unequaled. And why? Subhūti, it is because the six perfections make up this deep perfection of wisdom. Subhūti, it is because inner emptiness, up to the emptiness that is the nonexistence of an intrinsic nature make it up; and the four applications of mindfulness, four right efforts, four legs of miraculous power, five faculties, five powers, seven limbs of awakening, and eightfold noble path make up this deep perfection of wisdom. Subhūti, it is because the Tathāgata’s ten powers make up this deep perfection of wisdom; the four fearlessnesses, four detailed and thorough knowledges, and eighteen distinct attributes of a buddha make it up; and because, Subhūti, the buddha, up to the knowledge of all aspects make up this deep perfection of wisdom.

Similarly, all the dharmas of śrāvakas, or all the dharmas of pratyekabuddhas, or all the dharmas of bodhisattvas, or all the buddha dharmas, whatever they are, they all make up the perfection of wisdom; it is this perfection of wisdom that  does their work. Therefore, Subhūti, this perfection of wisdom has been made available through tremendous work. Subhūti, this perfection of wisdom has been made available through incomparable work, immeasurable work, incalculable work, work equal to the unequaled. And why? Because, Subhūti, this deep perfection of wisdom is made available so you do not hold on to and do not settle down on form; this deep perfection of wisdom is made available so you do not hold on to and do not settle down on feeling, perception, volitional factors, or consciousness; this deep perfection of wisdom is made available so you do not hold on to and do not settle down on . . . up to the knowledge of all aspects; this deep perfection of wisdom is made available so you do not hold on to and do not settle down on the result of stream enterer; and similarly, this deep perfection of wisdom is made available so you do not hold on to and do not settle down on the result of once-returner, the result of non-returner, the state of a worthy one, a pratyekabuddha’s awakening, up to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening.”{{page:{number:885,id:UT22084-029-001-12266,folio:F.144.b,volume:V30}}}

Subhūti, I too do not see . . . up to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. And because I do not see it, I do not hold on to it. Because I do not hold on to it, I do not settle down on it. Subhūti, I too do not see a buddha level, all-knowledge, knowledge of all aspects, or tathāgatahood. And because I do not see it, I do not hold on to it. Because I do not hold on to it, I do not settle down on it. Therefore, Subhūti, bodhisattvas should not hold on to and should not settle down on form. They should not hold on to and should not settle down on feeling, perception, volitional factors, or consciousness.

The bodhisattvas who transform it like that will stand on the śrāvaka level or the pratyekabuddha level. And why?

Because those bodhisattva great beings, starting from the production of the first thought, have given gifts but not grasped at a causal sign; have guarded morality, cultivated patience, made an effort at perseverance, become absorbed in concentration, and cultivated wisdom but  not grasped at a causal sign; have not grasped at the morality, meditative stabilization, wisdom, freedom, or knowledge and seeing of liberation of past, future, and present lord buddhas as causal signs; and have not grasped the emptiness meditative stabilization, signless meditative stabilization, or wishless meditative stabilization as causal signs either.

Without mental distraction they do not see the phenomenon that is the phenomenon to be actualized, and not seeing that phenomenon they do not  actualize it. And why?

They contemplate that it is not the time it should be actualized, but rather it is the time it should be mastered. When not in actual meditative equipoise, bodhisattva great beings attach their minds to an objective support and without letting the dharmas on the side of awakening lessen, in the meantime do not actualize the extinction of outflows.

Therefore, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings who want to get to a state where they are not led astray by others, who want to remain in that state where they are not led astray by others, who want to allay the doubts of others, who want to purify a buddhafield, and who want to bring beings to maturity should train in this perfection of wisdom. And why? Because in this perfection of wisdom are taught in detail those dharmas in which bodhisattva great beings have to train.” {{page:{number:1063,id:UT22084-029-001-12444,folio:F.233.b,volume:V30}}}

Because this giving of yours is empty of an intrinsic nature of giving, its result is empty of an intrinsic nature of a gift, the benefactor is empty of an intrinsic nature of a benefactor, and the recipient is empty of an intrinsic nature of a recipient, so in emptiness giving cannot be apprehended, and neither can the result of giving, the benefactor, or the recipient.

Therefore, Śāriputra, except for ‘aggregates,’ or ‘constituents,’ or ‘sense fields’ settled down on by beings confused about the self, all dharmas are without a real basis, without a vital essence, devoid of a vital essence, the nonexistence of an intrinsic nature, empty of a basic nature, and empty of their own marks, so bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom, having seen that all dharmas are the nonexistence of an intrinsic nature, empty of a basic nature, and empty of their own marks, conjure up a body like a magician’s and teach the Dharma to beings. They give a discourse on giving to beings who are stingy, give a discourse on morality to beings who are immoral, give a discourse on patience to beings thinking malicious thoughts, give a discourse on perseverance to beings who are lazy, give a discourse on meditative stabilization to beings who are distracted, and give a discourse on the intellect to beings with intellectual confusion.

And why? Because those bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom do not apprehend any being at all except as a conventional term in conventional usage. Śāriputra, standing there in the two truths, bodhisattva great beings teach the doctrine to beings. Nevertheless, in the two truths, Śāriputra, there is no apprehension of a being and no designation of a being. But still bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection with skillful means teach the doctrine to beings so that those beings do not apprehend a self even in this very life, never mind what they will obtain, or how they will obtain it.

In the absence of the designation of a being, a being is not bound and is not freed; since a being is not bound and is not freed, there is no defilement and there is no purification; since there is no defilement and there is no purification, forms of life do not have specific features; since forms of life do not have specific features, there is no karma and there are no afflictions; and given that there is no karma and there are no afflictions, however could there be a maturation, a maturation on account of which I and beings come to be in the five forms of life in the stream of cycles of existence?”{{page:{number:1429,id:UT22084-029-001-12811,folio:F.113.b,volume:V31}}}

Śāriputra, if a being there before were not there later, there would thus be the fault that a bodhisattva and tathāgata ‘would have been there before and would not be there later’; and there would also be the fault that the five forms of life in the stream of cyclic existence would have been something that really existed before and would be something that really does not exist later. Therefore, Śāriputra, whether the tathāgatas arise or whether the tathāgatas  do not arise, the true dharmic nature of dharmas—suchness, unmistaken suchness—remains. In it there is no self, there is also no being, there is also no living being, there is also no person, there is also no one who does, and there is also no one who makes someone else do, so however could there be form there? However could there be feeling, perception, volitional factors, and however could there be consciousness? However could there be the five forms of life in the stream of cycles of existence from which beings are to be freed, given that dharmas do not exist and are not there?{{page:{number:1430,id:UT22084-029-001-12812,folio:F.114.a,volume:V31}}}

Bodhisattva great beings armed with such armor do not turn back from unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. Armed with such armor they think, ‘It is not that I will not fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening; rather, I will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening,’ and, ‘Having fully awakened, I will work for the welfare of beings, a welfare that comes with the sort of Dharma that frees beings from distortion.’

Do not, by seizing on giving gifts, make a body come into being, a body that brings with it the experience of many sufferings. Sons of a good family, ultimately giving does not exist here, a benefactor does not exist, and a recipient does not exist either. Those three phenomena are empty of an intrinsic nature, so a phenomenon empty of a basic nature does not receive, and the emptiness of a basic nature is not grasped.’ In that way, Subhūti, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of giving, they give gifts to beings like that but without apprehending giving, without apprehending a giver, and without apprehending a recipient there. Such a perfection of giving is a perfection of not apprehending anything. Bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of giving  connect beings with the result of stream enterer;similarly, connect this with each, up to connect them with unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening without apprehending any of those three phenomena.

Furthermore, Subhūti, all dharmas are the path of the bodhisattva great beings. 
{{milestone:{label:77.3,id:UT22084-029-001-5949}}} “What do you think, Subhūti, is there a dharma in which bodhisattva great beings do not train, without training in which they will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening?

{{milestone:{label:77.4,id:UT22084-029-001-5950}}} Then venerable Subhūti asked the Lord, “Lord, if all dharmas are empty, how will bodhisattva great beings train in all dharmas? Lord, if they say ‘there are this many,’  or ‘they are these,’ or that these dharmas are ordinary or extraordinary, or with outflows or without outflows, or compounded or uncompounded, or the dharmas of ordinary people, or worthy one dharmas, or pratyekabuddha dharmas, have they elaborated on what cannot be elaborated, or else are they not one?”{{page:{number:1444,id:UT22084-029-001-12826,folio:F.121.a,volume:V31}}}

But, Subhūti, these beings do not know ‘all dharmas are empty,’ so bodhisattva great beings, having fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening, make a presentation of all dharmas and teach  the doctrine to beings. {{page:{number:1445,id:UT22084-029-001-12827,folio:F.121.b,volume:V31}}}{{note:{index828,id:UT22084-029-001-5953}}}
{{milestone:{label:77.7,id:UT22084-029-001-5954}}} “Subhūti, there, right from the beginning, bodhisattva great beings practicing the awakening path should reflect deeply on the fact that here, except for its being an enactment, there is no dharma at all that can be apprehended through its own intrinsic nature. And when they thus reflect deeply on the nature of those dharmas, they do not settle down on the perfections, or the thirty-seven dharmas on the side of awakening, or the result of stream enterer, or the result of once-returner, or the result of non-returner, or the state of a worthy one, or a pratyekabuddha’s awakening, or unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening, or any dharma at all. And why? Because all dharmas are empty of an intrinsic nature of all dharmas, so emptiness does not settle down on emptiness. And when even emptiness cannot be apprehended, what need is there to say more about emptiness settling down on emptiness? 
{{milestone:{label:77.8,id:UT22084-029-001-5955}}} “Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings thus abide without settling down on all dharmas. Standing in that training they think, ‘What are these beings doing?’, and looking at what all beings are doing, think, ‘They are grasping at nonexistence.’ It then occurs to the bodhisattva great beings to think, ‘Oh! I will free these beings well from grasping at the unreal.’ So, standing with skillful means in the perfection of wisdom, they give them advice: ‘Come here, all of you! Give gifts, and through that you will get richer and richer. But do not project a sense of false superiority because of those riches. They are totally worthless.’ Similarly, they advise them to guard morality but not project a sense of false superiority because of that morality: ‘It too is totally worthless.’ Similarly patience, similarly perseverance, similarly concentration, and similarly̛, they advise them to cultivate wisdom but not project a sense of false superiority because of that wisdom: ‘It is totally worthless.’ Similarly, they advise them to meditate on the result of stream enterer, similarly the result of once-returner, similarly the result of non-returner, similarly the state of a worthy one, similarly a pratyekabuddha’s awakening, and similarly, up to all buddhadharmas: ‘But do not project a sense of false superiority because of those dharmas.

{{milestone:{label:77.9,id:UT22084-029-001-5956}}} “Thus, while giving advice and instruction and practicing the awakening path, they still do not settle down on any dharma at all. And why? Because, based on having emptiness as their nature, all dharmas are not things that have been settled down on, because they have no intrinsic nature such that they could have been settled down on. Thus, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings practice the awakening path but are not located anywhere. By way of not being located, they practice the perfection of giving but they are not located there. They practice the perfection of morality but are not located there. They practice the perfection of patience but are not located there.

 “Subhūti, they are not located for two reasons. And what are the two? It is because those results where they might be located have no intrinsic nature, nor does that on account of which they might be located, nor those who might be located. And second, because up until they fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening they are not easily satisfied. They think, ‘It is not that I should not reach the result of stream enterer, but even after having reached the result of stream enterer I should not stand there; up to it is not that I should not reach a pratyekabuddha’s awakening, but even after having reached a pratyekabuddha’s awakening I should not stand there. And why? Because from my production of the first thought I have never produced any other thought except that of unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening.’ And why? Because those bodhisattva great beings, from the first production of the thought, have never produced any other thought except that of unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening. And similarly, starting from when they entered into the secure state of a bodhisattva up until they reached the tenth level, their thought  never wavered and they never produced any other thought except of unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening.{{page:{number:1448,id:UT22084-029-001-12830,folio:F.123.a,volume:V31}}}

It is impossible that they would take birth among the long-lived gods. It is impossible that they would take birth in areas where the wholesome dharmas are practiced incorrectly or with a sheep-like obtuseness. It is impossible that they would take birth in areas where there are robbers and barbarians, at the outer limits of society. It is impossible that they would take birth in families with wrong views.  It is impossible that they would take birth where there is no word Buddha, no word Dharma, and no word Saṅgha. It is impossible that they would take birth where they follow the view that action has no consequences. It is also impossible, Subhūti, that bodhisattva great beings, having set out from the first production of the thought for unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening with a surpassing aspiration, would ply the ten unwholesome actions.”{{page:{number:1460,id:UT22084-029-001-12842,folio:F.129.a,volume:V31}}}

The completion of all wholesome dharmas is unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening, so starting from the first production of the thought up until seated at the site of awakening, there is no wholesome dharma at all that bodhisattva great beings do not have to complete. They will not fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening unless they complete all those wholesome dharmas. It is impossible. Therefore, Subhūti, bodhisattva great beings should train in the completion of all wholesome dharmas from the first production of the thought onward.

And why? Because those bodhisattva great beings do not apprehend any dharma at all that could be contacted, that makes contact, or where contact could be made. And why? Because all three of those dharmas are empty of an intrinsic nature.  Hence emptiness does not contact emptiness and emptiness does not contact any dharma at all, and emptiness is also not something that can be contacted. That, Subhūti, is the emptiness of not apprehending. Standing there, the bodhisattva great beings fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening.”{{page:{number:1464,id:UT22084-029-001-12846,folio:F.131.a,volume:V31}}}

{{milestone:{label:78.33,id:UT22084-029-001-6045}}} Then venerable Subhūti asked the Lord, “Lord, how do bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom, standing in the emptiness of all dharmas, find and produce within themselves the perfection of clairvoyance that grows from wholesome roots  planted in relation to those lord buddhas, a clairvoyance that they stand in when they travel to world systems as many as there are sand particles in the Gaṅgā River in the eastern direction, attend on the lord buddhas dwelling and maintaining themselves in those world systems, and listen to them teaching the doctrine?”{{page:{number:1465,id:UT22084-029-001-12847,folio:F.131.b,volume:V31}}}

If those world systems were not empty of an intrinsic nature, and those lord buddhas were not empty of an intrinsic nature, and those practices that are designations were also not empty of an intrinsic nature, there would then just be a partial emptiness. But such a partial emptiness is not apprehended, so all dharmas are empty of all dharmas, and therefore bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom with skillful means find and produce within themselves the perfection of clairvoyance, and standing in that clairvoyance find and produce within themselves the divine eye, divine hearing, performance of miraculous power, knowledge of others’ thoughts, recollection of past lives, and knowledge of deaths and births.

While in pursuit they see all wholesome dharmas with their divine eye, connect others to all wholesome dharmas, but do not settle down on those wholesome dharmas. And why? Because all those wholesome dharmas are empty of an intrinsic nature, and emptiness does not settle down on anything. In emptiness there is no experience to be relished, so there is nothing to be settled down on and nothing to be experienced. Therefore bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom find and produce the divine eye within themselves, and with the divine eye those bodhisattva great beings standing in the true nature of dharmas produce bodies of the kind that teach the doctrine to beings, but still do not apprehend beings or the designation of beings. {{page:{number:1466,id:UT22084-029-001-12848,folio:F.132.a,volume:V31}}}

It is because having mounted on it causes all beings to enter nirvāṇa;

You must reject causal signs. You must reject real existence. You must reject the view that there is a being. Son of a good family, you must reject bad friends and must serve, attend on, and worship those spiritual friends who teach dharmas that are emptiness, the signlessness, and the wishlessness, not produced, not born, not really existent,  and not stopped. Son of a good family, when you are making progress like that it will not be long before you learn the perfection of wisdom that has been put into a book or that exists in the body of a monk who preaches the Dharma. Son of a good family, you should imagine whomever you learn this perfection of wisdom from to be the Teacher, and, son of a good family, you should feel appreciation and feel a sense of gratitude.

By learning this perfection of wisdom I will quickly become irreversible from unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening, will stay close by the tathāgatas, worthy ones, perfectly complete buddhas and be born in buddhafields where I will not be separated from the tathāgatas.
