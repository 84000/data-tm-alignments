{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-101-079-691}}}Thus did I hear at one time. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-101-079-81,folio:F.183.b}}} The Blessed One was teaching the Dharma to his full assembly at the Vajrāsana. The bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi said to him, “O Blessed One! Please pacify the suffering of beings.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-101-079-72}}}The Blessed One replied, “Sons or daughters of noble family who wish to pacify outer, inner, and secret suffering should apply themselves to meditation upon Mañjuśrī Vādisiṃha for six months while reciting this mantra, which is derived from the vowels and consonants of the alphabet:

{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-101-079-75}}}“By reciting this mantra just once, they will obtain the dhāraṇī of longevity. If they recite it ten times, they will be able to impartially elucidate wisdom.{{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-101-079-76}}} If they recite it a hundred times, the whole world system will tremble. If they recite it a thousand times, all desires will be fulfilled. If they recite it ten thousand times, all suffering will be pacified. If they recite it a hundred thousand times, they will behold the face of a perfect buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-101-079-77}}}When the Blessed One had finished speaking, the bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi along with all in the assembly were delighted, and respectfully joined their palms together and praised what the Blessed One had said.
