{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-101-122-27}}}May all buddhas grant their protection!
I pay homage to supreme awakening;
May all noble ones grant their protection!

May all knowledge granters grant their protection!
I pay homage to all the gods of the pure god realms;
May all protectors grant their protection!
I pay homage to the gods in the heavens;
May the lords of the three worlds grant their protection!
To all those who rule over the three realms of existence
I pay homage and offer worship;
Grant your compassionate blessings
To my five aggregates and limbs!
