Gayāśīrṣa Hill
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-049-004-38}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-049-004-295,folio:F.285.a}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time. Not long after attaining full awakening, the Bhagavat was residing at the shrine of Gayāśīrṣa on Gayā Hill together with a great saṅgha of bhikṣus numbering one thousand—all of them previously ascetics with matted hair, having done what had to be done, with their task accomplished, their burdens laid down, their own purpose attained, the fetters of existence extinguished, their minds freed through perfect knowledge, and the excellence of all powers of the mind perfected, and exclusively arhats—and a great many bodhisattva great beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-049-004-41}}}Then, alone, the Bhagavat went into isolation, settled himself inwardly, and examined the dharmadhātu, thinking, “I attained awakening. I realized gnosis. I did what had to be done. I laid down my burden. I crossed the wild forest of saṃsāra. I eliminated ignorance. I accomplished knowledge. I removed the thorn. I extinguished craving. I built the ship of Dharma. I beat the drum of Dharma. I blew the conch of Dharma. I raised the banner of Dharma. I overcame the way of saṃsāra. I described the way of Dharma. I cut off unfit paths. I demonstrated the path. I rejected barren fields. I demonstrated the fields of merit.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-049-004-42}}}“Now, how did I realize awakening? {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-049-004-296,folio:F.285.b}}} By what means did I realize it? Who realized it? These things ought to be examined.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-049-004-43}}}“Was it realized by the body? Or was it realized by the mind? 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-049-004-44}}}“With respect to its being realized by the body, the body is inert matter, motionless—like grass, a tree, a wall, a clod of earth, and a visual aberration—mindless, derived from the four elements, arisen from the impurities of one’s parents, impermanent, and in need of constant anointing, washing, and massage; it has the properties of perishing, breaking apart, and being destroyed.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-049-004-45}}}“The mind is like an illusion, dependently originated, without a basis, without characteristics, without substance, and in an open state.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-049-004-46}}}“Awakening is merely a name, merely a convention, without language, not analyzable, not established, without movement, without engagement, without cognition, and not to be designated. It has transcended coming and going, transcended designation, and transcended the three realms. It is unseen, unheard, undifferentiated, without foundation, unobservable, without movement, without elaboration, without engagement, and not examinable. It is immeasurable, indemonstrable, without words, without syllables, without verbal expression.{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-049-004-47}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-049-004-48}}}“Thus, who will attain full awakening? By what means will one attain full awakening? What is it to be fully awakened? All these things are mere names, merely designated, mere signs, mere conventions, conceptualized and imagined. They are not arisen, without arising, not a substance, without substance, without appropriation, indemonstrable, and without attachment. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-049-004-49}}}“In that regard, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-049-004-297,folio:F.286.a}}} nobody will attain full awakening. There is no means by which one will attain full awakening. There is nothing whatsoever to be fully awakened. There is no means whatsoever by which to be fully awakened. Because of attaining full awakening in that way, it is called attaining full awakening, as in that regard awakening is immutable, unchanging, and without characteristics.”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-049-004-50}}}Then, the ever-youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, if the characteristics of awakening are such, Bhagavat, how should a son of good family or a daughter of good family advance toward awakening?”{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-049-004-51}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-049-004-52}}}“Mañjuśrī,” replied the Bhagavat, “a bodhisattva should advance toward awakening in accordance with how that awakening is.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-049-004-53}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Bhagavat, how should one seek awakening?”
“Mañjuśrī,” replied the Bhagavat, “awakening transcends the three realms, transcends conventions, transcends the language of syllables, and transcends words. It is without engagement—without engagement from the very beginning. Therefore, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas who have transcended engagement should advance toward awakening.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-049-004-55}}}“Mañjuśrī, engagement that is without engagement is engagement in awakening. Mañjuśrī, engagement in the absence of substance is engagement in awakening. Mañjuśrī, engagement in an open state is engagement in awakening. Mañjuśrī, engagement in the nature of the dharmadhātu is engagement in awakening. Mañjuśrī, engagement in the absence of fixation on all phenomena is engagement in awakening. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-049-004-298,folio:F.286.b}}} Mañjuśrī, engagement in the indivisible very limit of reality is engagement in awakening.

Mañjuśrī, engagement in the properly understood visual aberration, echo, space, reflection of the moon in water, and mirage is engagement in awakening.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-049-004-57}}}Then, the god Light of the Magnificent Light Rays of the Stainless Moon asked the ever-youthful Mañjuśrī,{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-049-004-58}}} “Mañjuśrī, what is the beginning of bodhisattvas’ conduct? What is its basis?”

“Divine son,” replied Mañjuśrī, “these four are the kinds of the bodhisattvas’ giving rise to the mind of awakening that are included among causes and included among results. What are these four? They are the initial giving rise to the mind of awakening, that which is associated with conduct, the irreversible, and that which is separated from the goal by one birth. With respect to these, the initial giving rise to the mind of awakening should be viewed as the cause of the giving rise to the mind of awakening that is associated with conduct; that associated with conduct should be viewed as the cause of the irreversible; the irreversible should be viewed as the cause of that which is separated from the goal by one birth; the giving rise to the mind of awakening that is separated from the goal by one birth should be viewed as the cause that is associated with the result.

“Son of good family,” replied Mañjuśrī, “the object is unconditioned, and hence it should be understood as neither associated with nor dissociated from any phenomena whatsoever. Why is that? The object has the characteristic of being immutable, and hence it should be understood as neither associated with nor dissociated from any phenomena whatsoever.
