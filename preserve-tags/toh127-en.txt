Chapter 17
{{milestone:{label:17.1,id:UT22084-055-001-1653}}}When the Bhagavān had finished speaking, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, who was seated there, in his mind recited this verse to the Bhagavān.{{note:{index637,id:UT22084-055-001-1654}}}
{{milestone:{label:17.2,id:UT22084-055-001-1655}}}“I am going, Tathāgata,{{note:{index638,id:UT22084-055-001-1656}}} to the king of mountains, 
Gṛdhrakūṭa, which is always the residence of the buddhas.
When I have gone there, lamp of the world,{{note:{index639,id:UT22084-055-001-1657}}}
I will make inconceivable offerings to you.” {i}
{{milestone:{label:17.3,id:UT22084-055-001-1658}}}The Bhagavān knew the thoughts that were in the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya’s mind, and from his own mind sent this verse to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya:
{{milestone:{label:17.4,id:UT22084-055-001-1659}}}“Go, Ajita, you who have conquered the māras,{{note:{index640,id:UT22084-055-001-1660}}}
To the king of mountains where jinas reside. 
There you will quickly accomplish 
A great unsurpassable benefit for beings.” {ii}
{{milestone:{label:17.5,id:UT22084-055-001-1661}}}So the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, having received in his mind that verse from the Bhagavān, paid homage to the Bhagavān in his mind and, again in his mind, circumambulated him three times. He then left the assembly and went to Gṛdhrakūṭa, the king of mountains, which has been the residence of countless buddhas, as numerous as the grains of sand in the ocean, and where there is a great caitya. 
{{milestone:{label:17.6,id:UT22084-055-001-1662}}}The moment he arrived there, for the enjoyment of the Bhagavān, he magically transformed the king of mountains to become level and vast, without any tree stumps, thorns, stones, pebbles, or gravel, and with a surrounding wall made of the seven jewels. The ground was composed of countless shining sapphire jewels and was adorned by divine adornments and jewels, all of them beyond compare, and beautified by an array of innumerable, different kinds of jewels. All the area was decorated by the clothing of Tuṣita devas, {{page:{number:107,id:UT22084-055-001-5940,folio:F.54.b}}} pervaded by the aroma of incense from a variety of censers, adorned by garlands and wreaths, scattered with various flowers; it resounded with the sound of divine music, was filled with erect and fluttering banners and flags, and over it canopies were suspended. 
{{milestone:{label:17.7,id:UT22084-055-001-1663}}}In the center of this area a divine lion throne made from the seven jewels was emanated. It was draped in cloth that was not woven, and covered with divine clothing from Tuṣita that was as soft and pleasant to the touch as down. A central awning hung above, and there were two red cushions placed upon it. It was a yojana wide and a yojana high. 
{{milestone:{label:17.8,id:UT22084-055-001-1664}}}Its beautiful footstool, made of Jambu River gold, transcended that of humans and devas. It was covered with a net of strings of pearls, and it was draped in divine, precious cottons.
{{milestone:{label:17.9,id:UT22084-055-001-1665}}}Strung upon the lion throne were strings of divine, precious bells from which came clear, beautiful, gentle sounds. In all directions there were great shining jewels. And there was emanated a precious, vast parasol, with a handle made of a great, precious jewel of stainless beryl. 
{{milestone:{label:17.10,id:UT22084-055-001-1666}}}The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya now emanated an inconceivable, adorning array of various jewels on Gṛdhrakūṭa, the king of mountains, and in its entire environs. Then, in an instant, he returned to the home of the youth Candraprabha.
{{milestone:{label:17.11,id:UT22084-055-001-1667}}}Once he was back there, in his mind he paid homage to the Bhagavān, and in his mind circumambulated him three times. He then sat on his seat.
It was said:
{{milestone:{label:17.12,id:UT22084-055-001-1669}}}He manifested the mountain as a divine, vast place
With excellent, beautiful jewel flagstones— 
Inconceivable, divine, formed from the mind—
And he placed in the center a precious lion throne. {iii}
{{milestone:{label:17.13,id:UT22084-055-001-1670}}}Jinaputra Ajita also manifested 
A divine, splendid parasol that emitted delightful sounds
With great shining jewels all around,
And a handle of pure, beautiful beryl. {iv}
{{milestone:{label:17.14,id:UT22084-055-001-1671}}}Maitreya, the hero, having emanated
A variety of jewels on the mountain, 
And a precious seat that was a krośa in size, {{page:{number:108,id:UT22084-055-001-5941,folio:F.55.a}}}
In one instant returned to the house.{{note:{index641,id:UT22084-055-001-1672}}} {v} 
{{milestone:{label:17.15,id:UT22084-055-001-1673}}}Then the Bhagavān taught the Dharma to the great assembly that was like an ocean. He inspired them, he filled them with joy, and he guided them. Then he rose from his seat and departed. And with the miraculous power of a buddha he emerged through Rājagṛha’s gate of the hot springs and proceeded toward Gṛdhrakūṭa, the king of mountains. When he arrived he went to the site created by Maitreya, and having arrived there he sat upon the great lion throne that Maitreya had manifested.{{note:{index642,id:UT22084-055-001-1674}}}
{{milestone:{label:17.16,id:UT22084-055-001-1675}}}He was encircled by the assembly of bhikṣus, and the saṅgha of bodhisattvas gazed upon him from the front. The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, rishis, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans paid homage to him. Within the ocean-like assembly, he taught the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:17.17,id:UT22084-055-001-1676}}}Then the youth Candraprabha arrived together with a hundred thousand quintillion beings, and many millions of bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had come from other worlds. They were holding flowers, incense, and garlands; playing musical instruments and percussion; holding parasols, banners, and divine flags; and holding great garlands as offerings. 
{{milestone:{label:17.18,id:UT22084-055-001-1677}}}In order to make this offering to the Bhagavān they left the great city of Rājagṛha through the gateway of peace,{{note:{index643,id:UT22084-055-001-1678}}} and went to Gṛdhrakūṭa, to the Bhagavān. They bowed down their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated him three times, made a great offering to him of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, food, parasols, banners, and flags, playing music and percussion, and then they sat down in one place. In order to ask about the Dharma they sat in that place with veneration and with respect while the youth Candraprabha, kneeling on his right knee, {{page:{number:109,id:UT22084-055-001-5942,folio:F.55.b}}} with palms placed together, bowed toward the Bhagavān{{note:{index644,id:UT22084-055-001-1679}}} and said to him, “If the Bhagavān will give me an opportunity to seek answers to them, I have a few questions for the Bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha.” 
{{milestone:{label:17.19,id:UT22084-055-001-1680}}}The Bhagavān addressed the youth Candraprabha, saying, “Young man, the Bhagavān will always give you the opportunity. Ask whatever question you wish to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:17.20,id:UT22084-055-001-1681}}}The Bhagavān having given him this opportunity, the young man Candraprabha asked, “Bhagavān, it is through possessing what qualities that bodhisattva mahāsattvas attain the samādhi, the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena?”
The Bhagavān replied to Candraprabha, “Young man, if bodhisattva mahāsattvas possess four qualities, they will attain the samādhi, the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena. 
{{milestone:{label:17.21,id:UT22084-055-001-1683}}}“What are those four qualities? Young man, one is that bodhisattva mahāsattvas are calm, and pleasant company. They have self-restraint, and have attained a level of self-restraint such that when others abuse them or insult them, they will be patient with the abuse and the insults that are spoken, for it is their nature to have endurance; they have the view of karma, have overcome pride, and their desire is for the Dharma. Young man, if bodhisattva mahāsattvas have this first quality, they will attain this samādhi.{{note:{index645,id:UT22084-055-001-1684}}}
{{milestone:{label:17.22,id:UT22084-055-001-1685}}}“Another, young man, is that bodhisattva mahāsattvas have correct conduct.

They are not devoted to attaining success through knowledge. They think first of what will benefit others, and they teach and explain extensively to others the Dharma that they have received. They have no desire for material gain through their reputation.
