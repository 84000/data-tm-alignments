They could abide in the sameness of the unobscured realm of phenomena and had realized the sameness of the limit of reality and the realm of phenomena. They had conviction in the way in which actions lead to ripening and the way in which results appear based on causes, and they had knowledge of the sameness in which all phenomena are like the emergence of a stamped image. They had realized the sameness in which phenomena appear like optical illusions and reflections. They had complete knowledge of sound and language  and understood that all phenomena are like echoes.{{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-055-003-579,folio:F.176.b}}}{{note:{index12,id:UT22084-055-003-33}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-055-003-34}}}All of them had attained the absorption of inconceivable liberation and the absorption of the heroic stride. They had the limitless colors of a buddha’s body and were established in the dhāraṇī that accomplishes the entirely perfect state. They were skilled in causing all the buddha realms to be seen in the space of a single hair’s breadth. In the space of a single hair’s breadth they could show a buddha’s passing away, taking birth, departing from home, practicing austerities, journeying to the seat of enlightenment, awakening, turning the wheel of Dharma, and passing into nirvāṇa. They possessed a wisdom that expanded to pervade the world systems in the ten directions while they remained in one position. They possessed the wisdom that can cause the ornaments of all universes to be seen in a single universe, as well as the wisdom that can cause the ornaments of a single universe to be seen in all universes. They were able to cause the entourage of all thus-gone ones in all the world systems in the ten directions to be seen within the entourage of a single thus-gone one, and they were also able to cause the entourage of a single thus-gone one to be seen in the entourages of all thus-gone ones. 
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-055-003-35}}}They were skilled in showing how all phenomena are without center or periphery. They had reached the end of all limitless phenomena.

They were skilled in considering the bodies of all beings to be empowered as their own bodies. They were skilled in considering the bodies of all buddhas to be a single buddha body. They were skilled in causing other beings to see how the body of a single buddha pervades the bodies of all buddhas without exception. They were skilled in causing all world systems in the ten directions to be seen within their own bodies.

{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-055-003-36}}}Resting evenly in absorption within a single body, they were able to cause beings to see the act of manifesting limitless bodies. Having awakened with one body, they were able to cause as many bodies as there are beings to be seen. They were able to cause the bodies of all beings to be seen within the body of a single being, and they were also able to cause the body of a single being to be seen in the bodies of all beings. They were able to cause the bodies of beings to be seen as the Dharma body, and they were also able to cause the Dharma body to be seen as the bodies of beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-055-003-37}}}They were skilled in empowering the aspirations of all bodhisattvas as their own aspirations. They were able to cause bodhisattvas to see the full awakening of all the buddhas, as well as their aspirations, powers, and full awakening. They were able to cause fully mature beings to see their unsurpassed and perfect awakening in whatever ways necessary to train them.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-055-003-38}}}Their aspirations were uninterrupted throughout all eons. With their mastery in leaving the body of the consciousness and entering the wisdom body they could appear to all the multitudes of beings. Having broken the continuity of their own bodies, they appeared for the complete fulfillment of the aspirations of other multitudes of beings. They endeavored in aspirations that ripen beings. As their bodhisattva conduct was uninterrupted throughout all the ages of a single world, the strength of their aspirations directed toward full awakening enabled them to cause indescribably many worlds encompassing all the buddha realms to be seen within the space of a single hair’s breadth. They were able to cause numerous bodies to be seen within a single world. By uttering a single word of the Dharma, they would bring down a rain of ambrosia born from great clouds of Dharma that filled the entire realm of phenomena. Through the lightning of intelligence and liberation and the thunder of true reality,  they manifested to satisfy all the different kinds of beings and fulfill their great aspirations.{{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-055-003-581,folio:F.177.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-055-003-39}}}The field of their experience was to be engaged in concentration, freedom, superknowledge, intelligence, and wisdom. Through one instance of arousing the mind of awakening, they were able to manifest bodies of all beings born in all possible ways in all the infinite world systems in the ten directions. Since they had no attachment to knowledge of their own or others’ minds, they were proficient in the knowledge of the processes and movements present in a single being’s mind as well as in all beings’ minds. They were skilled in the wisdom that can engage the ten powers of the thus-gone ones in a single instant. They were immersed in the wisdom that is not attached to anything whatsoever throughout the three times. They were skilled in the wisdom that brings genuine attainment to the mindstreams of others.

They were skilled in entering into all world systems. They were skilled in engendering the aspirations of all buddhas and bodhisattvas as well as their own conduct and aspirations. They were skilled in shining the light of Dharma. They were skilled in entering into inexpressibly numerous eons and world systems within a single atom. They were skilled in causing a buddha realm the size of all the universes to be seen within a single atom. They could make all the water in all the oceans fit within a single pore of the skin.

They were skilled in absorbing inexpressibly numerous world systems into their own bodies and causing the diverse activities of beings to be seen. They could make the surrounding mountains, the greater surrounding mountains, and other huge mountains—incalculable, inconceivable, incomparable, immeasurable, limitless, and absolutely inexpressible—fit within a single pore. Thus, they were skilled in going to all the world systems throughout the extent of the realm of phenomena while not frightening beings in any way.
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-055-003-44}}}They were skilled in transforming inexpressibly numerous eons into a single eon and in displaying one eon as inexpressibly numerous eons of destruction and formation. In order to properly train others, they were skilled in causing all beings to see how all world systems will be  destroyed by water, fire, and wind. Though they could crush uncountable and inconceivable world systems with their big toes, every one of them was skilled in not bringing harm to beings.{{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-055-003-583,folio:F.178.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-055-003-45}}}They had all gained attainment by means of the cloud of Dharma, and they were skilled in displaying the transformation of great suffering, in the form of harm, injury, and famine, to train beings in all the worlds of the ten directions.

{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-055-003-58}}}At that time, from every pore of the Blessed One’s skin, and from each of his excellent signs and all his marks, the Blessed One emitted rays of light as numerous as all the atoms in ten buddha realms. Each light ray bathed in a bright light as many world systems as there are atoms in one hundred million buddha realms. The light caused countless quadrillions of bodhisattvas to arrive from each of these world systems. Each of the bodhisattvas had a jewel mansion measuring billions of leagues and adorned with gems, pearls, and jewel tassels around a bejeweled platform. Sitting below hoisted flags and banners and surrounded by uncountable quadrillions of divine maidens, they arrived at the place where the Blessed One was residing, scattering clouds of divine flowers,  clouds of jewels, clouds of garments, clouds of sandalwood and agarwood incense, and clouds of divine instruments, cymbals, and song—clouds as large as world systems.

{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-055-003-60}}}It was then that the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla stood up, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together he bowed toward the Blessed One and made the following request: “May I ask if the Blessed One might give me the opportunity to seek instruction? If so, there are a few points on which, blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, I would request your clarification.”
The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla, “Bhadrapāla, you may ask whatever you please. I will delight your mind by answering your question.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-055-003-62}}}So Bhadrapāla asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what are the basis, conduct, manner, distinction, roots of virtue, diligence, peace, skill in wisdom, mindfulness, realization, intelligence, propriety, interest, and armor by which bodhisattva great beings may make irreversible progress toward unsurpassed  and perfect awakening, and from that unsurpassed and perfect awakening know no debasement or decline? {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-055-003-587,folio:F.180.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-055-003-63}}}“How do bodhisattva great beings come into being due to the actions of the thus-gone ones? How do they train diligently in the wisdom of the thus-gone ones? How does their insight increase? How are they skilled in great wisdom? How is their discipline so pure? How is it that, in not forgetting what they have heard, they possess recollection? How is it that, in taking birth in accordance with their roots of virtue, they remember their past lives?
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-055-003-64}}}“How is it that they are skilled in knowing the previous lifetimes of others and inspiring them? How is it that they are wise by being knowledgeable about differences in faculties? How do they possess the marks? How is it that they are never separate from seeing the Buddha, hearing the Dharma, or honoring the Saṅgha? How is it that they behold the blessed buddhas present in other world systems? How is it that they are able to hear the Dharma of those blessed ones in all the infinite world systems and then retain it, master it, and teach it truly on a vast scale? How is it that they are like tongues of flame in burning the roots of nonvirtue? How is it that they are like the moon in mastering all bright phenomena? How is it that they are like the sun in dispelling all the darkness of ignorance? How have they become so elevated by all roots of virtue that they are like the king of mountains? How is it that they are like vajras in having unshakable acceptance of the profound? 
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-055-003-65}}}“How are they fearless in being like the highest mountain? How is it that their voices are incredibly pure by having unimpeded eloquence? How is it that they are exceedingly learned by being proficient in discerning and ascertaining all the different languages? How is it that they do not scowl but keep their countenance smiling and radiant?  How is it that they are not contaminated by worldly phenomena? How is it that their voices can be heard across limitless world systems? How is it that, when they show the limitless, endless world systems inside a single pore, beings do not understand where we are and do not understand what was done?{{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-055-003-588,folio:F.181.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-055-003-66}}}“How is it that, by ripening beings, they stay within the retinues of all thus-gone ones throughout the ten directions and never move from those places? How is it that they live in the Heaven of Joy, pass away, enter the womb, take birth, leave home, undertake austerities, sit at the seat of awakening, gain victory over demons, turn the wheel of Dharma, demonstrate passing into the great transcendence of suffering, and demonstrate teaching so that the teachings remain—all within the space of a single hair’s breadth? How is it that they can become aware of the mental activity of all beings in a single moment of mind?”
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-055-003-67}}}The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla, “Bhadrapāla, excellent, excellent. Bhadrapāla, you have asked in this manner to benefit many beings and to bring them happiness. You have great compassion that loves the world and seeks to benefit ordinary beings—gods and humans alike—by accomplishing their welfare and happiness. Bhadrapāla, your intention in having asked the Blessed One such a question is excellent. Therefore, Bhadrapāla, I will answer you, so listen well and keep what I say in mind.”
“Excellent!” the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla replied to the Blessed One, and listened in the manner that the Blessed One had instructed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-055-003-69}}}The Blessed One said, “Bhadrapāla, there is a bodhisattva activity that is the absorption that the Buddha calls the miraculous ascertainment of peace.  Bodhisattva great beings who dwell in that absorption attain, in addition to many others, the following special qualities.{{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-055-003-589,folio:F.181.b}}}{{note:{index13,id:UT22084-055-003-540}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-055-003-70}}}“So, Bhadrapāla, what is this absorption called the miraculous ascertainment of peace? It is like this. It is to understand all phenomena in accordance with their actual nature, comprehend their characteristics, and overcome mistaken characteristics. It is to no longer hold on to the habitual basis of a self. It is to no longer apprehend an other. It is to not think highly of one’s own life. It is to not enter saṃsāra. It is to understand all entities. It is to meditate on tranquility and to actualize special insight. It is to be stable minded and undistracted in mindfulness and to pacify notions and judgments. It is to keep company with virtue and to discard nonvirtue. It is to pacify attachment, aversion, and dullness, to dispense with ignorance, and to rely on knowing. It is to understand causation, to demolish a view, and to be free from consciousness. It is to arouse wisdom, to exhaust existence, to abandon attachment to joyful states, to be certain about buddhahood, and to have no doubt about the Dharma. It is to not be skeptical about the Saṅgha and to reconcile disputes arising from divisive speech. It is to adhere to solitude, to be adept in integrating the teachings, to not speak foolishly behind someone’s back, and to be without worldly goods.

Likewise, as for the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind being void, their voidness is neither existent nor nonexistent. In the case of form, sound, smell, taste, texture, and mental phenomena, their voidness is neither existent nor nonexistent. And why? Because it is utterly devoid of a self and anything that belongs to a self. It is entirely devoid of anything that is permanent, stable, solid, or immutable. Hence, it cannot be described as either empty or not empty, nor can it be described as either past or not past, future or not future, or present or not present. Thus, it cannot be said to be past, present, or future. It cannot be described in such terms. And why? Because it is empty of the past, the future, and the present.

It cannot be known through the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind. It cannot be known by means of any type of conditioning. It is the cessation of all conditioning related to body, speech, and mind. What causes this cessation? Is this the cessation of something that arose in the past and then subsequently ceased? Or is this a cessation in terms of something that was destroyed in the past? Is there something that ceases by being destroyed? The conditioning of nonvirtuous karma is produced because previously one remained in ignorance. Yet with knowledge of this fact, conditioning ceases.

As their own bodies are the natural state, they realize the bodies of all beings to be the natural state. And why? Since all bodies are like reflections, they can let the bodies of all beings enter and merge with their own bodies. They can also make their own bodies follow and merge with the bodies of all beings.

And the branches of awakening, all paths, the unborn limit, and all attainments are no longer sought. This is the branch of awakening concerned with sameness.
{{milestone:{label:1.162,id:UT22084-055-003-178}}}“When viewing form, correct view is to see the elements and sense sources as having the nature of non-entities. By way of having parts and not having parts, they are seen as sameness. As the path of the noble ones is seen as not truly a path, the bodhisattva does not entertain any views.  As the path of the noble ones and all views are seen to be without any characteristics, they do not have any views. Instead, since there is no disturbance, this is referred to as the genuine view. Since all phenomena are seen, this is known as the view. As the unborn is attained, it is termed the path. In terms of sameness, it is known as the genuine mode. Being unobscured, it is referred to as the view. As it applies to all paths and non-paths, it is termed the path.{{page:{number:59,id:UT22084-055-003-633,folio:F.203.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.163,id:UT22084-055-003-179}}}“Correct conception occurs when all concepts and thoughts regarding form are the same. In that way, the bodhisattvas do not conceive of entities or non-entities, do not conceive of disruption or permanence, do not conceive of birth or non-birth, do not conceive of concepts or no concepts, and do not conceive of nonthought, nonconceptuality, or the correct path.
{{milestone:{label:1.164,id:UT22084-055-003-180}}}“Correct speech refers to knowing sameness in the sense that, with regard to form, all phenomena are beyond language and speech, pronunciation and non-pronunciation. They have no names and are unnamable. They are beyond examination and they are not the branches of the path. The word correct does not relate to any verbal mode and is not uttered. Still, all the qualities of the so-called path are uttered.
{{milestone:{label:1.165,id:UT22084-055-003-181}}}“Correct action is to view all actions with regard to form as non-actions. They are not something that one performs, and they should therefore not be conceived of as such. Those who attain the state of not acting do not investigate. They do not take up any type of investigation, such as wrong investigation, correct investigation, active investigation, non-active investigation, or any other type of action or non-action. In this way all the endless actions, whether certain, uncertain, correct, incorrect, virtuous, nonvirtuous, neutral, non-transferring, related to the path, or not related to the path, are seen to be unborn. Without engaging in any action, the bodhisattvas see all actions as optical illusions. {{page:{number:60,id:UT22084-055-003-634,folio:F.204.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.166,id:UT22084-055-003-182}}}“Correct livelihood is to know the sameness of the pleasant and the unpleasant concerning form and to rest within the realm of phenomena without any observation of correct or incorrect livelihood. Being without observation in this way, livelihood and action fall away. ‘Correct’ here means sameness. ‘Livelihood’ means upholding the Dharma of the noble ones. ‘Path’ and ‘non-path’ refer to the path that is free from striving. ‘Livelihood’ also refers to not having any thoughts or notions concerning livelihood or lack of livelihood. ‘Correct’ means to abide within sameness. Such is correct livelihood.
{{milestone:{label:1.167,id:UT22084-055-003-183}}}“Correct effort is to be effortless in body, speech, and mind concerning forms due to the sameness of the realm of phenomena. Thus, bodhisattvas are effortless with regard to the realm of phenomena. ‘Correct’ means free from accepting and rejecting any phenomena that abide within the unborn nature. ‘Effortless’ is a term for not having any observation in terms of body, speech, and mind. ‘Path’ means to strive for the objective of the noble ones via freedom from acceptance and rejection as well as to transcend striving. 
{{milestone:{label:1.168,id:UT22084-055-003-184}}}“Correct mindfulness is to practice mindfulness of form by virtue of being without mindfulness. Such absence of mindfulness is sameness in which one rests without using mindfulness to objectify something. ‘Correct’ is a term for the sameness in the absence of objectification beyond imputation. ‘Mindfulness’ is a term for recollecting the aggregates, the elements, and the sense sources. It refers to recollecting emptiness, the absence of marks, and the absence of wishes. Thus, it is a term for the effortless recollection of the absorption of the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.169,id:UT22084-055-003-185}}}“Correct absorption is to know the indivisible nature of form, which is also the correct practice of the activities related to sameness and absorption. Knowing the sameness of form also entails knowing the sameness of feelings, perception, formation,  and consciousness. Knowing the sameness of the aggregates, the bodhisattvas will also correctly perceive the sameness of absorption. They will then also correctly perceive the sameness of the absorption of the Thus-Gone One’s family. When they perceive the absorption of the Thus-Gone One’s family, they perceive the sameness of all phenomena. When they perceive the sameness of all the qualities of the Buddha, they perceive the sameness of all the qualities of ordinary and immature beings. The absorption that perceives the sameness of all the qualities of ordinary and immature beings also perceives the sameness of all the qualities of the Buddha. With the sameness of absorption, they perceive the sameness of the past aggregates, elements, and sense sources. Likewise, they perceive the sameness of the future and present aggregates, elements, and sense sources. Just as they perceive the aggregates, elements, and sense sources, so they also perceive karma and its ripening. Thus, the bodhisattvas rest in the type of absorption that equalizes the three times.{{page:{number:61,id:UT22084-055-003-635,folio:F.204.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.170,id:UT22084-055-003-186}}}“Correct knowledge is to know thatness and suchness concerning form and thereby know the truth. The bodhisattvas feel devotion to the truth that the nature of reality is also the nature of the aggregates, elements, and sense sources and, moreover, that the absence of the nature of reality is also the absence of the nature of the aggregates, elements, and sense sources. ‘Transformative power’ refers to the unfailing reality. And why? Because whatever is unfailing is also true. When they are grounded in that, they will utter pure aspirations and perform pure activity. They will be blessed to manifest emanations of the Thus-Gone One based on the aggregates, elements, and sense sources. Knowing the sameness of the truth of the earth element, they will also know the sameness of the truths of the water, fire, and wind elements.  They will also know the sameness of space, qualities, sounds, optical illusions, and reflections. They will also know the sameness of characteristics and the absence of characteristics, being attached and not being attached, brief and elaborate eons, limited and limitless eons, eons with and without buddhas, past and future eons, future and past eons, and present and future and past eons, as well as past and future and present eons. Eons of pollution merge with eons of purification, eons of purification with eons of pollution, and blessed eons with eons of sameness. The knowledge of such merging comes from the absence of such concepts. This is the truth of the realm of phenomena, and thus it is also known as the transformative power of truth. This is the truth of form. Likewise, it is the truth of feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. All truthful speech that rests within that state is blessed. Such is the transformative power of truth.{{page:{number:62,id:UT22084-055-003-636,folio:F.205.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.171,id:UT22084-055-003-187}}}“Because of resting in equanimity, the bodhisattvas do not grasp at form, are without thoughts, and are generous and renunciate. That is the transformative power of generosity. Knowing not to accept and reject form is the pacification of all movements and fluctuations. ‘Transformative power’ refers to the transformation of all pollution into purification as one abides in that peace. ‘Purification’ is to bless pollution. When resting in that peace, one can demonstrate all types of activities. For example, one can stimulate desire in those who observe celibacy, and by manifesting in the form of Vajrapāṇi one can make those who act in non-peaceful ways, as well as all demons, become interested in the transformative power of peace. The transformative power of peace  pacifies, calms, and soothes all ordinary and immature beings. Perceiving the attainment of the transformative power of peace is called the transformative power of thorough pacification.{{page:{number:63,id:UT22084-055-003-637,folio:F.205.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.172,id:UT22084-055-003-188}}}“The transformative power of insight refers to knowing that form is indivisible from the realm of phenomena. This is known without labelling or positing anything. With nonconceptual insight, all phenomena related to utter and thorough peace and the freedom from conceptual constructs, as well as the aggregates, elements, and sense sources, are blessed to be the omniscient state. Alternatively, ‘transformative power’ relates to the omniscient state, which is the abode of insight. That is why one’s body, which is just a fathom tall, should be thought of as the world. It should be thought of as the source of the world, the end of the world, the path that leads to the end of the world, and also as the wisdom of omniscience. That is the transformative power of insight.”

Having made these offerings, the bodhisattvas may then commemorate those thus-gone ones by building a memorial for each of them, each memorial as large as this world, made of gems in all colors, and reaching to the peak of existence. They may then surround these memorials with a railing of glittering gems and adorn them with a latticework of wish-fulfilling gems and garlands of banners before anointing them with sandalwood incense. In this way there would be as many offerings as there are atoms in ten universes. Finally, the bodhisattvas may offer incomparable divine offerings to each of the memorials for as many eons as there are atoms in ten buddha realms. On the other hand, other bodhisattvas may faithfully aspire to this absorption and, because of that, offer something as simple as a single meal to a being who has been born as an animal. Compared to the merit created by these latter bodhisattvas, the merit created by the former bodhisattvas would not equal even one percent of it. Nor would it equal a thousandth, a hundred thousandth, a billionth, a ten billionth, or a trillionth of that.

With each hand they made countless, unimaginable, incomparable, and immeasurable offerings as large as the divine realms, sending forth cloud banks of parasols, banners, standards, flowers, sandalwood incense, jewelry, bright lion banners, gems that shone in all colors, and wish-fulfilling jewels.

They also brought down a rain of divine fabrics, parasols, banners, standards, sandalwood incense, and cloud banks of gems and jewelry. Śakra, Brahmā, and an utterly incalculable number of trillions of guardians of the world paid homage to this Dharma teaching by bringing down a shower of cloud banks of flowers, fabrics, and jewels the size of the entire world.

Accompanied by inconceivable melodies from their divine instruments, they exclaimed:
