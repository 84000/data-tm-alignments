Thus did I hear at one time. At the time of his parinirvāṇa, the Blessed One was resting between a pair of śāla trees in the Yamakaśāla Grove near Kuśinagara, in the country of the Mallas. At this time, Venerable Ānanda went to see the Blessed One. When he came into his presence, he joined his palms together and then stood there looking at the Blessed One with his eyes wide open. The Blessed One asked Venerable Ānanda, “Son of Gautama, why are you looking at the Thus-Gone One with your eyes wide open?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-056-004-94}}}Venerable Ānanda replied, “Blessed One, I had a terrifying dream last night, a premonition of the Thus-Gone One’s parinirvāṇa, so terrifying that it made the hairs of my body stand on end. Blessed One, ever since this dream I have been worried that the Blessed One may soon pass into parinirvāṇa, and because of this I have been miserable, unhappy, and pained by sorrow.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-056-004-95}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of Gautama, what was this terrifying dream of yours, portending the Thus-Gone One’s parinirvāṇa?” 
The Blessed One also asked this to Venerable Ānanda in verse: {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-056-004-880,folio:F.145.a}}}

Each escorted by retinues of more than eighty billion gods, they went to where the Blessed One was. When they arrived, they bowed their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and in unison they cried out in despair—moaning, sobbing, and lamenting—and spoke these verses to Venerable Ānanda:

The Blessed One then spoke these verses for the sake of Venerable Ānanda:

{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-056-004-147}}}At that time, Venerable Aniruddha was at the summit of Sumeru teaching the Dharma to the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Venerable Aniruddha, who possessed pure divine sight that far surpassed that of a human, could see that the gods, renowned as the mightiest of the mighty, were disappearing from their palaces. He could hear, too, the gods’ powerful cries of lament, and he watched as his own audience thinned. Venerable Aniruddha focused his mind, and with his divine sight he looked closely at the world. The gods and their entourages were in a state of anxiety, giving up on their sense pleasures and departing somewhere in great haste. Venerable Aniruddha saw those who had reached farther and farther away from the summit of the king of mountains—some who were one hundred leagues distant, some two hundred leagues, some three hundred leagues, some four hundred leagues, and some five hundred leagues away—and some who had fallen into the ocean, though such beings could not be harmed nor injured, let alone killed. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-056-004-884,folio:F.147.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-056-004-148}}}Like those at the summit of Sumeru, all those beings living on Sumeru, the king of mountains—gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas—were struck with grief when they heard of the Blessed One’s parinirvāṇa. “Blessed Śākyamuni,” they cried, “king among lords of the Śākyas, who reached perfection countless millions of eons ago, whose roots of virtue are utterly pure, will today, in the country of the Mallas, before a pair of śāla trees, pass without grasping, into parinirvāṇa. Today, the eye of this world with its gods, shall close!” they cried, and they journeyed toward Kuśinagara, traveling with such haste that the peaks of Sumeru, the king of mountains, shook and trembled; traveling with such haste that Sumeru, the king of mountains, along with its oceans, quaked and roiled so violently that those at the summit of Sumeru, the king of mountains, fell into the ocean. 
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-056-004-149}}}Then Venerable Aniruddha, still seated at the summit of Sumeru, let out a great cry and spoke these verses:{{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-056-004-150}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-056-004-164}}}At the very moment Venerable Aniruddha finished speaking these verses, through the Buddha’s power, all the monks and nuns and male and female lay devotees in the world, the four communities who revered the Blessed One—except for Mahākāśyapa and his entourage, and 224 monks{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-056-004-165}}}—exclaimed, “This is our last chance to see the Blessed One!” and departed for that grove of śāla trees in the country of the Mallas.

Suffering and distraught, pierced by grief, they threw their arms in the air and sobbed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-056-004-167}}}Some wrung their hands as they wept. Some bumped their heads together, gazing into each other’s faces as they wept. Some, mouths agape, emitted wretched roars of anguish and, losing their senses, their faces pale, their arms and legs flailing, wept. Some just gazed at one another as they wept. Some banged their heads. Some struck their heads with both hands, hurting themselves physically. Some rolled their eyes and heaved with sobs, howling and crying out in pain, their knees shaking, as if the palms of their hands had been scorched. “Alas, Buddha! Alas, Buddha!” they cried, woeful and destitute, tears streaming down their faces. Rubbing their eyes with the palms of their hands and clawing at their faces, they howled in anguish. Stricken by grief, they cried out in pain.
{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-056-004-168}}}Many millions of other beings let out great cries as they read aloud while choked with tears. Some, with their palms pressed together, moaned as they read aloud in tears. Some, scorched by the fire of grief, held their heads in their right hands as they moaned. Others, physically ravaged, likewise held their heads in their left hands as they groaned. Some beat their arms, their faces pallid,{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-056-004-169}}} drained of color, and miserable with grief as they cried out. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-056-004-887,folio:F.148.b}}}

Some bowed to the Blessed One’s two feet. Some let out great roars of anguish. Some rolled on the ground while crying out in pain. Some, on entering the presence of the Blessed One, threw their arms in the air and exclaimed, “Alas, Buddha! Alas, Buddha! Alas, protector! Alas, compassionate one, who loves and protects all beings! Alas, refuge and last resort of the three realms, who watches over all beings! Alas, supporter of the unsupported! This world will be barren, all beings will be blind! The rare and precious Buddha will be no more!”
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-056-004-171}}}Joining hands, they lovingly grieved together as if mourning the death of their mother. They grieved as if mourning the death of their father, the death of their brother, or the death of their son, crying out over and over, “Alas, protector! Alas, virtuous friend, your speech is so gentle to hear, with the strength of a lion, of an elephant, of the greatest bull! Alas, nectar-like teacher!”
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-056-004-172}}}Some leapt into the air, struck themselves, and, falling back to the ground, rolled back and forth on the ground, crying out pitifully from the core of their beings.

This noble son attended his discourses as a monk called Delighting in Wisdom. In the presence of that thus-gone one, he heard words of wisdom, words difficult to understand, words that reveal meaning. He learned that all phenomena are without arising and without ceasing, that all phenomena are unreal, that all phenomena are by nature at peace, and that all buddhas attain the same awakening. After he heard this, for seven days, without any slackening of effort, he tirelessly thought of nothing else, and he physically inculcated those four statements, keeping them firm in his mind, considering them attentively, reciting them, and examining them well. Seeing their truth, he attained great realization.

{{milestone:{label:1.366,id:UT22084-056-004-556}}}The Blessed One then sent forth rays of soft, cooling light to comfort and soothe the intense torments of those inhabiting the Great Hell of Unceasing Torture. He taught those hell beings about emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness,{{note:{index:71,id:UT22084-056-004-557}}} with a teaching that was perfect in its thousand aspects and that gladdened the hearts of all, was pleasing to the ear, and brought welfare and happiness. He then uttered this verse:

That phenomena are empty, signless,
Unborn, and unconstructed
Are free from fears of the lower realms.”
{{milestone:{label:1.368,id:UT22084-056-004-559}}}When those words, unimpeded in the three times and rich in a hundred thousand qualities, reached their ears, eight trillion beings in the Great Hell of Unceasing Torture died and were reborn equal in fortune to the gods in the Heaven of Mastery over Others’ Emanations.
{{milestone:{label:1.369,id:UT22084-056-004-1559}}}The Blessed One then went to the Brahmā realms and spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.370,id:UT22084-056-004-561}}}“Those who do not experience suffering
Are supremely happy.
All names, conventional designations,
And conceptions are invalid.
{{milestone:{label:1.371,id:UT22084-056-004-562}}}“Those who can firmly abandon them
Will be free from suffering.
For them, even all conceptions

{{milestone:{label:1.372,id:UT22084-056-004-563}}}“Suffering increases exponentially

{{milestone:{label:1.376,id:UT22084-056-004-567}}}Then those eight trillion beings who had been reborn among those gods reached the exhaustion of defilements and became divine sages. Still recalling their suffering as hell beings in the hells, and in gratitude for the Thus-Gone One’s direct intervention,{{note:{index:72,id:UT22084-056-004-568}}} they exclaimed, “Rather than see the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha pass into parinirvāṇa, we will pass completely beyond suffering first!” 
Then, those gods who had reached the state of arhatship uttered this verse:
{{milestone:{label:1.377,id:UT22084-056-004-570}}}“Tamer of beings, helmsman, best of humans,
Maker of light, great illuminator, 
We will pass beyond,

{{milestone:{label:1.378,id:UT22084-056-004-571}}}And the moment they finished speaking, they passed completely beyond suffering. And at that moment, right then, that very instant, the Blessed One disappeared from the Brahmā realms and returned to the pair of śāla trees in the country of the Mallas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.379,id:UT22084-056-004-572}}}The Blessed One then thought, “This night, I, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, will pass into parinirvāṇa during the last watch of the night. Since this will be my last teaching, I will bring joy to beings with a great miracle that only the Thus-Gone One can manifest. It will make them happy, it will quell their suffering, so that all beings will merge unobstructedly with the nature of the Thus-Gone One. I will show them how the Buddha passes into parinirvāṇa.” {{page:{number:61,id:UT22084-056-004-939,folio:F.174.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.380,id:UT22084-056-004-573}}}The Blessed One then lay on his right side. With the fearlessness of a lion and the gaze of an elephant, he looked out over all beings in the ten directions and pierced the earth with the big toe of his right foot. At this strike, the earth let out a huge roar and shook in six different ways. Inconceivable quantities of light filled worlds in the ten directions, illuminating them all without obstruction. Rays of light flooded from the Blessed One’s body, and rays as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā poured from every pore. Each of those rays of light in turn emitted further rays of light as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, and each of those rays of light in turn illuminated as many buddha fields as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā. The rays of light did not merge with one another but shone continuously from every pore, completely illuminating every world system. With the Blessed One’s manifestation of such a miraculous display, all those beings became endowed with the eye of awakening and realized the detailed vision of awakening by means of the Buddha’s power and blessings. Everyone could clearly see all the buddha fields illuminated by the light of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:1.381,id:UT22084-056-004-574}}}The Blessed One then said to the monks, “Monks, do you see, in the east, a huge, wide, high, and expansive city covering an area of one hundred thousand leagues, completely filled with hundreds of thousands of tiny particles?”
“Yes, Blessed One,” replied the monks.
{{milestone:{label:1.382,id:UT22084-056-004-576}}}The Blessed One continued, “And what do you think, monks? Do you think those tiny particles are numerous?”
“Yes, Blessed One,” replied the monks. {{page:{number:62,id:UT22084-056-004-940,folio:F.175.a}}}
He continued:
{{milestone:{label:1.383,id:UT22084-056-004-579}}}“Those who clearly understand the Dharma,
As inexhaustible,{{note:{index:73,id:UT22084-056-004-580}}} free of grasping,
Unceasing, and uncorrupted,
Will not experience bad rebirth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.384,id:UT22084-056-004-581}}}Upon hearing this Dharma teaching, three hundred thirty million beings obtained the level of nonreturning.
{{milestone:{label:1.385,id:UT22084-056-004-582}}}{{note:{index:74,id:UT22084-056-004-583}}}The Blessed One then illuminated the beings dwelling in the eight great hells with a very gentle, delightful, and pleasant golden-colored light, born from love and compassion, {{page:{number:63,id:UT22084-056-004-941,folio:F.175.b}}} that pacified their suffering, pleased their eyes, enchanted their hearts and eyes, soothed them, and filled their bodies with ease. The waves of light rays that radiated from the pores of his skin thoroughly quelled the burning torments of those in the great hells and instilled happiness in them. The Blessed One drenched the bodies of those beings with this light, soothing them physically and mentally, making them fit again, and then, with speech endowed with many hundreds of thousands of good qualities, he spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.386,id:UT22084-056-004-584}}}“I bring happiness to the world;
I put an end to suffering.
I have shown complete peace
To those who are physically weary.

The Dharma of peace and happiness;

{{milestone:{label:1.389,id:UT22084-056-004-587}}}As soon as the Blessed One had spoken these verses, at that moment, right then, at that very instant, a great number of monks and an immeasurable number of blessed buddhas simultaneously, right then, at that very instant, having lain down on their right sides upon lion couches, also got up again, and all of them also displayed miracles like these. 
{{milestone:{label:1.390,id:UT22084-056-004-588}}}The four communities then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, why did all those blessed buddhas display such miracles just now? Why, just like the Blessed One, did they all display such miracles at the very moment, the very instant of passing into parinirvāṇa?”
{{milestone:{label:1.391,id:UT22084-056-004-589}}}The Blessed One replied, “It is so, monks: {{page:{number:64,id:UT22084-056-004-942,folio:F.176.a}}} all those blessed buddhas leaving their final existence today will pass into parinirvāṇa. All those thus-gone ones are none other than he who bears the name Śākyamuni. All of them have lain down on their right sides upon a lion couch between two śāla trees within the country of the Mallas. All of them will pass into parinirvāṇa today, during the last watch of the night.”
{{milestone:{label:1.392,id:UT22084-056-004-590}}}The Blessed One continued, “Monks, do you see to the east all the countless, immeasurable blessed buddhas about to awaken to unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening? Monks, in the south, the west, and the north, in the intermediate directions, and below and above, do you see countless, immeasurable blessed buddhas about to awaken to unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening?”
“Yes indeed, Blessed One,” they replied. “We see in our limited way. We cannot see in the ultimate way.”{{note:{index:75,id:UT22084-056-004-592}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.393,id:UT22084-056-004-593}}}The Blessed One continued, “Monks, it is like this; consider this analogy: if you were to fill the space from the ocean that surrounds the four great continents of this world to the upper limit of the Brahmā realms with the tiniest particles, do you think it would be possible to measure those particles, to count them, to approximate them, or to precisely quantify them?”
“No Blessed One,” they replied.
{{milestone:{label:1.394,id:UT22084-056-004-595}}}He continued, “Monks, it is so: if, to give an analogy, a world such as this with its four great continents were entirely filled with tiny particles, that is how many blessed buddhas I see to the east when I look with my ordinary eye of flesh. {{page:{number:65,id:UT22084-056-004-943,folio:F.176.b}}} It is like, for example, seeing something up close, just a yoke away, without conceptual thought, not seen from afar but directly, with unimpaired eyes. So too in the south, in the west, in the north, in the intermediate directions, and below and above.
{{milestone:{label:1.395,id:UT22084-056-004-596}}}“Indeed monks, it is so: to the east I see blessed buddhas as numerous as the tiny particles it would take to completely fill a hundred thousand worlds from the oceans that surround the four great continents to the upper limits of the Brahmā realms—those who are about to sit and those who are seated at the seat of awakening, all of whom are none other than blessed buddhas who bear the name Śākyamuni. Likewise, I see as many blessed buddhas who bear the name Dīpaṅkara, who bear the name Sarvābhibhū, who bear the name Padmottama, who bear the name Atyuccagāmin, who bear the name Yaśottara, who bear the name Krakucchanda, who bear the name Kanakamuni, and who bear the name Kāśyapa.{{note:{index:76,id:UT22084-056-004-597}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.396,id:UT22084-056-004-598}}}“Likewise, I also see blessed buddhas known by a variety of other names, active in this world with the Dharma that is vast, diverse, and supreme. I see blessed buddhas known by different names living and thriving now. I see blessed buddhas with such names who are yet to pass into parinirvāṇa, who are still living, turning the wheel of Dharma. They all clearly appear to my unobscured, unimpeded, and unattached ordinary eye of flesh. {{page:{number:66,id:UT22084-056-004-944,folio:F.177.a}}} This is how the Thus-Gone One knows. But the Thus-Gone One knows more, much more than that—what he knows is inconceivable, inconceivably greater than that. It is superior, far superior to that; it is unfathomable, unfathomably greater than that. 
{{milestone:{label:1.397,id:UT22084-056-004-599}}}“With my ordinary eye of flesh, I see that the number of thus-gone ones is immeasurable, infinite, unfathomable, and uncountable, not to mention the qualities of those buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:1.398,id:UT22084-056-004-600}}}“Monks, it is so: for comparison, consider householders or renunciates who for an entire eon have venerated, served, honored, worshiped, revered, supplicated, and made inconceivable quantities of various offerings to perfect buddhas as numerous as all the beings in this buddha field who have reached unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening and developed the ten powers and the fearlessnesses. Compared to them, a noble son or noble daughter who develops faith, even for an instant, in this Dharma teaching as discerned and taught by all the buddhas, and who with a mind free of doubt develops the right understanding of it will, as soon as this is developed, produce a much greater amount of merit and will come closer to the many buddha qualities. Even if all the beings of this great trichiliocosm spent an eon revering those who have attained omniscience, they would not generate as much merit. Any bodhisattva great being who cultivates devoted interest in this wisdom will not only come closer to the blessed buddhas, but they will also come closer to unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:1.399,id:UT22084-056-004-601}}}When this prophetic discourse concerning his eye of flesh was given, six hundred twenty million beings generated the mind set on unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening. {{page:{number:67,id:UT22084-056-004-945,folio:F.177.b}}} They thought, “Though it is difficult to reach unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening, with this our sufferings are over, our afflictions are ended, and we will achieve the exhaustion of the defilements,” and reached the stage of irreversibility. Innumerable beings were established at the level of training. Ten billion bodhisattvas, by generating the mind set on awakening for the first time, became fully accomplished, and thirty-two trillion bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:1.400,id:UT22084-056-004-602}}}Then wicked Māra became dispirited and distressed. Weeping and choked with tears, he complained to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I do not want beings to ever escape my grasp. Thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, you wish to pass into parinirvāṇa for their sake. You never diminish, so you have a lifespan that lets you remain for eons, yet before dawn, before sunlight spreads across the land, you will have established countless beings in nirvāṇa. Blessed Thus-Gone One, you will empty my domain!”
{{milestone:{label:1.401,id:UT22084-056-004-603}}}The Blessed One replied to wicked Māra, “Wicked one, those who do not fully strive for virtuous qualities and those who do not cultivate faith in the domain of the Thus-Gone One will be your companions, and you, too, will be their companion. You will have many to keep you company, so do not weep! Wicked one, stop wailing!”
{{milestone:{label:1.402,id:UT22084-056-004-604}}}The Blessed One then reached down to the ground, and picking up some dust with the tip of his fingernail, he asked wicked Māra, {{page:{number:68,id:UT22084-056-004-946,folio:F.178.a}}} “Wicked one, what do you think? Is there more dust on the tip of my fingernail or covering this vast earth?”
{{milestone:{label:1.403,id:UT22084-056-004-605}}}“Blessed One, there is less dust on the tip of your fingernail, and much more covering this vast earth!” replied the wicked one.
{{milestone:{label:1.404,id:UT22084-056-004-606}}}The Blessed One then said to wicked Māra, “Wicked one, as in this analogy, the sentient beings whose afflictions I have exhausted and established individually in unsurpassable parinirvāṇa are far fewer than the particles of dust on the tip of my fingernail, and as in this analogy, wicked one, beings far more numerous than the particles of dust covering this vast earth have gone to your domain. So, since the realms of beings are limitless, you should be happy, wicked one! Indeed, wicked one, how long such beings remain depends on what they themselves do; there is nothing even you can do about it. So, wicked one, since there are countless realms of beings like this, do what you will with them! The Thus-Gone One will pass into parinirvāṇa during the last watch of this night.”
{{milestone:{label:1.405,id:UT22084-056-004-607}}}The Blessed One then asked the monks, “Monks, do you see the blessed buddhas?”
“Yes indeed, Blessed One,” they replied.
{{milestone:{label:1.406,id:UT22084-056-004-609}}}The Blessed One said, “Even more than this, you will see that they are utterly limitless. Do you also see the world systems of the blessed buddhas and their wondrous buddha fields? Do you see the great arrays of the bodhisattvas and the excellences of the hearers?”
“Yes indeed, Blessed One. Yes indeed, Well-Gone One,” they replied.
{{milestone:{label:1.407,id:UT22084-056-004-611}}}The Blessed One continued, “Monks, {{page:{number:69,id:UT22084-056-004-947,folio:F.178.b}}} the knowledge of the Thus-Gone One extends even beyond that; his knowledge is utterly infinite. Monks, the abundance of thus-gone ones and the abundance of buddha fields I see in world systems in the ten directions are so numerous that even if I were to spend an eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons, a hundred thousand eons, ten million eons, a billion eons, or more describing them thoroughly and in great detail and with analogies, the task would still be incomplete. Monks, what I have to teach you, my disciples, I have already taught. I have held nothing back. I have taught you the entirety of the Dharma in all its aspects, inside and out. There is not even the tip of a blade of grass worth of teachings you have yet to receive, so now it is up to you to be diligent! I have taught you the Dharma of nirvāṇa, I have shown you the path that leads beyond suffering, I have produced roots of virtue that are extremely hard for beings to produce, and I have achieved unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening. Now you must all do likewise and under no circumstances let the teachings be spoiled!”
{{milestone:{label:1.408,id:UT22084-056-004-612}}}The Blessed One then performed a miracle such that by the performance of this miracle the Dharma being taught by blessed buddhas in world systems in the ten directions could be heard by the beings in this buddha field. Those beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā who fully understood the Dharma taught by those blessed buddhas were firmly established in the three vehicles; ten trillion were firmly established in the state of unsurpassed, completely perfect awakening; ten billion beings were established in solitary awakening; {{page:{number:70,id:UT22084-056-004-948,folio:F.179.a}}} and an even greater number reached the state in which defilements are exhausted. The teachings likewise benefited immeasurable, uncountable, infinite, and inconceivable billions of other beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.409,id:UT22084-056-004-613}}}The Blessed One then said to the monks, “Monks, I will now pass into parinirvāṇa. Henceforth, you must do whatever you can to protect the teachings of the Buddha. Monks, in order to take care of yourselves and benefit others, you must train in this way.”
{{milestone:{label:1.410,id:UT22084-056-004-614}}}When the Blessed One had finished speaking, Venerable Ānanda and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said.
