{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-056-006-28}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Veṇuvana, at the Kalandakanivāpa, near the city of Rājagṛha, with a great saṅgha of a thousand monks, all of whom were noble ones. They had all exhausted defilements, were free from the afflictions, were powerful, had liberated minds, had liberated insight, were of noble birth, were great elephants,{{note:{index12,id:UT22084-056-006-29}}} had done what needed to be done, had completed their mission, had cast off the burden, had achieved their own welfare, had severed the bonds that tied them to existence, had liberated their minds with genuine knowledge, and had perfected all mental powers. There was also a great saṅgha of ten thousand bodhisattvas, including {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-056-006-1882,folio:F.188.a}}} {TK6} the princely youth Holder of Meru’s Peak, the princely youth Varuṇamati, the princely youth Sumati, the princely youth Jayamati, the princely youth Jinamati, the princely youth Intelligent Light, the princely youth Intelligent Sky, the princely youth Intelligent Lightning, the princely youth Mañjuśrī, the princely youth Durdharṣa, the princely youth Varuṇa, the princely youth Vimala, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, and others. Each of these ten thousand bodhisattvas had achieved acceptance, retention, and absorption. {TK7} Each possessed the wisdom that is unobscured by any phenomenon, had equal concern for all beings, had transcended all the domains of Māra, and had entered the domain of all the thus-gone ones. Each was knowledgeable, possessed great love and compassion, and was skilled in means.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-056-006-30}}}At the same time, there were two wandering mendicants{{note:{index13,id:UT22084-056-006-31}}} in the city of Rājagṛha who were learned, lucid, and intelligent, had perfected the eighteen branches of knowledge, and had five hundred servants. One was named Upatiṣya and the other Kaulita. These two were heads of their retinues and leaders of pupils. They made each other the promise that “whoever first attains the nectar{{note:{index14,id:UT22084-056-006-32}}} shall let the other know.” {TK8}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-056-006-33}}}Early the next morning, Venerable Aśvajit donned his lower and upper Dharma robes. Carrying his alms bowl, he went to the city of Rājagṛha to collect alms. The wandering mendicant Upatiṣya happened to come across Venerable Aśvajit and saw that he had entered the city of Rājagṛha to collect alms. He thought, “How is it that I have never before seen such beautiful deportment in any other mendicant, brahmin, or person as in this mendicant? {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-056-006-1883,folio:F.188.b}}} I shall go before him and ask, ‘Venerable One, who is your teacher? With whom did you go forth? Whose doctrine are you devoted to?’”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-056-006-34}}}So the wandering mendicant Upatiṣya went to where Venerable Aśvajit was and engaged in a good deal of friendly conversation. They then sat down to one side. Sitting there, the wandering mendicant Upatiṣya asked Venerable Aśvajit, “Venerable One, who is your teacher? With whom did you go forth? Whose{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-056-006-35}}} doctrine are you devoted to?”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-056-006-36}}}Then Venerable Aśvajit answered the wandering mendicant Upatiṣya: {TK9}
“The son of the Śākyas has mastery over all disciplines and great austerities.
Having crossed the ocean of saṃsāra he is now free, and so liberates others.
Known as ‘Buddha,’ being unequaled in his capacity to awaken, he dries up the ocean of suffering, and now exists here in this world.
I have taken refuge in this Immaculate One and am devoted to his Dharma.” {1.1}
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-056-006-38}}}“What does your teacher preach? What does he teach?” asked Upatiṣya.
Venerable Aśvajit responded, “I will answer you. Venerable, listen well and bear what I say in mind. I will answer you.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-056-006-40}}}“The Guide professed how the world arises caused by action and afflictions,
And he also professed the remedies for reversing such action and afflictions.
This Lord of Orators taught from his own knowledge the supreme liberation, 
Where the sufferings of birth, aging, and decline are definitely not present.”{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-056-006-42}}} {1.2} {TK10}
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-056-006-43}}}When the wandering mendicant Upatiṣya heard this teaching, he purified the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena. A state free from the afflictions arose, and he attained the fruit of stream entry. He then said:
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-056-006-44}}}“The Buddha teaches the ambrosial Dharma, a treasure to hear, that is so difficult to find.
It penetrates the truth, drying up the perpetual torrent of rebirth.
It quells the suffering of all beings.
This sublime path consists in the peerless cultivation of qualities of insight.” {1.3}{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-056-006-1884,folio:F.189.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-056-006-45}}}The wandering mendicant Upatiṣya then asked Venerable Aśvajit, “Venerable, where is the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha right now?”
Venerable Aśvajit answered, {TK11} “Venerable, the Blessed One is now staying in Veṇuvana, at the Kalandakanivāpa, near Rājagṛha. He is residing there with the great monastic saṅgha of one thousand monks who have gone forth and who used to have matted hair.”{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-056-006-47}}}
Upatiṣya said, “Once I have seen my best friend and disciples, I will vow to go forth before the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-056-006-49}}}The wandering mendicant Upatiṣya then bowed his head to the feet of Venerable Aśvajit and circumambulated him three times. He once again departed and went to meet the wandering mendicant Kaulita. The wandering mendicant Kaulita saw the wandering mendicant Upatiṣya coming from far off and exclaimed, “Venerable, given that your faculties look so clear, that your facial complexion looks so pure, and that the tone of your skin looks so light—Venerable, you must have found the nectar!”
“So it is, Venerable One!” Upatiṣya responded. “I have found the nectar! Therefore, Venerable, listen well and bear what I say in mind. I will tell you of what I have found.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-056-006-51}}}The wandering mendicant Kaulita then rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With palms together he bowed toward Upatiṣya and said: {TK12}
“Tell me of the path to peace and the end of anguish,
Which swiftly takes one across the ocean of the three realms of existence
While destroying the great enemy of the aggregates.
I will then set forth on the path that eliminates further origination.” {1.4}
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-056-006-53}}}The wandering mendicant Upatiṣya then said:
“The Guide professed how the world arises caused by action and afflictions,
And he also professed the remedies for reversing such action and afflictions.
This Lord of Orators taught from his own knowledge the supreme liberation wherein sufferings of birth, aging, and decline are definitely not present.” {1.5}{{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-056-006-1885,folio:F.189.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-056-006-55}}}Kaulita responded:
“That sage teaches the immaculate and peaceful Dharma that serves to quell all suffering.
It quells all afflictions, negative views, and faults, and it cuts through unknowing.
He teaches that conditioned things are false and thus empty and deceptive.
Hearing this brings one to peace, so please repeat these immaculate words that he spoke.” {1.6} {TK13}
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-056-006-57}}}Upatiṣya said:
“The Guide professed how the world arises caused by action and afflictions,
And he also professed the remedies for reversing such action and afflictions.
This Lord of Orators taught from his own knowledge the supreme liberation
Wherein sufferings of birth, aging, and decline are definitely not present.” {1.7}
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-056-006-59}}}The wandering mendicant Kaulita then purified the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena. As he was thus purified and his afflictions were eliminated, he attained the fruit of stream entry. Then he proclaimed: 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-056-006-60}}}“This genuine conduct is a boat that liberates from, quells, and swiftly crosses the river.
This supreme wisdom pacifies the three types of suffering and crosses over saṃsāra.
If one realizes this, one will defeat the afflictions and aggregates and tame the māras.
This emancipation clears away enemies and struggles and dries up the ocean of suffering.” {1.8}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-056-006-61}}}Kaulita asked, “Where is the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha right now?”
“Venerable,” Upatiṣya answered, “I have heard that the Blessed One is now staying in Veṇuvana, at the Kalandakanivāpa, near Rājagṛha, with a great saṅgha of monks and a great saṅgha of bodhisattvas. {TK14} What if we go forth in the presence of the Blessed One?”
“Venerable One,” replied Kaulita, “we should do so. With our followers in mind, let us go forth.”
The wandering mendicants Upatiṣya and Kaulita then went to their followers.
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-056-006-64}}}Just then in the land of Aṅga-Magadha, Māra the evil one heard that the learned, well-spoken, eloquent, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-056-006-1886,folio:F.190.a}}} and renowned good men Upatiṣya and Kaulita, along with their followers, were on their way to take ordination under the teachings of the monk Gautama. He thought, “Alas! If those two become students of the monk Gautama, they will empty my māra realm. So I must go there and dissuade those two good men from going forth. {K1}{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-056-006-66}}} I must make them embrace the view of the evil one.”{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-056-006-67}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-056-006-68}}}At the same moment, Māra, the evil one, disappeared from his abode and took on the apparel, attributes, and behavior of Venerable Aśvajit. He stood in the road before the two good men, and declared:
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-056-006-69}}}“What I said before about causation, using cause similes, is wrong.{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-056-006-70}}}
I said it in order to definitively test your way of thinking.
All that I said before is nonsense, as there are no karmic causes.
How could bad or good actions possibly produce results? {1.9} {K2}
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-056-006-71}}}“You should promptly pursue sensual delights and seek amusements.
There is no death, nor is there birth, suffering, aging, or the hereafter, {TK15}
And there are no good or bad results generated by action, given that there are no causes or actions. 
The scion of the Śākyas teaches this for his own gain, so do not put your faith in him.” {1.10}
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-056-006-72}}}Upatiṣya and Kaulita then thought, “It must be Māra, the evil one, who has approached us in order to dissuade us from entering the religious life.” 
Upatiṣya turned around and addressed his followers. “Listen, my pupils, and remember the shortcomings of saṃsāra:
“The world is afflicted by old age and surrounded by death.{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-056-006-75}}}
To eliminate them both, you must fully embrace the wandering mendicant’s life.” {1.11}
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-056-006-76}}}Kaulita, for his part, spoke to Māra:
“Known as the best, the Dharma captivates the minds of the wise and ends the three sufferings.
There is no one anywhere who could shake us from this knowledge.{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-056-006-78}}}
We constantly exert ourselves {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-056-006-1887,folio:F.190.b}}} with the resolute intention to quell our craving.
How could the words of a jackal in a lion’s guise sway our minds?” {1.12}
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-056-006-79}}}Those gods who were able to behold truth hovered in the sky and {K3} applauded these two good men: “Good, good it is, O good men! This path whereby one leaves home to embrace the life of a wandering mendicant is eminent throughout the entire world. It quells all suffering. It is the path leading into the domain of all the thus-gone ones. {TK16} It has been explained and praised by all the blessed buddhas as the path that leads from home to the life of a wandering mendicant.”
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-056-006-80}}}Māra, the evil one, unhappy, dejected, and sullen, disappeared then from that very spot.
The two wandering mendicants, Upatiṣya and Kaulita, directed their gaze at their followers and said, “You ought to know, pupils, that owing to the Thus-Gone One{{note:{index23,id:UT22084-056-006-82}}} the two of us are setting forth into the wandering mendicant’s life in order to reach the far shore of the ocean of aging, sickness,{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-056-006-83}}} and death. Any of you who do not wish to go forth in line with the teachings of the Blessed One should turn back here and now.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-056-006-84}}}Then the five hundred pupils all said, “Whatever we know is through your authority. If the two of you are embracing the wandering mendicant’s life on account of someone great, we too shall become wandering mendicants on account of the same person.”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-056-006-85}}}The two wandering mendicants Upatiṣya and Kaulita, together with their retinue of five hundred,{{note:{index25,id:UT22084-056-006-86}}} then set out to go forth under the Blessed One. Māra, the evil one, knew this, and so he conjured up a huge chasm outside of the great city of Rājagṛha one hundred leagues deep {K4} so that the two would be unable to go before Gautama the monk. The Blessed One, however, performed a miraculous feat whereby the wandering mendicants Upatiṣya and Kaulita did not see that great chasm {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-056-006-1888,folio:F.191.a}}} and could travel by the most direct route.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-056-006-87}}}Māra, the evil one, further conjured a mountain range in front of them—stable, solid, unbreakable, without valleys, singularly thick, hard, and{{note:{index26,id:UT22084-056-006-88}}} one thousand leagues tall. {TK17} In addition, he conjured one thousand fierce lions, vicious and terrible, making a great din.{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-056-006-89}}} But the two good men, thanks to the force of the Blessed One’s splendor and miraculous powers, did not see that mountain. Nor did they see the lions or hear their roaring. Instead, they arrived where the Blessed One was by the straightest possible route. 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-056-006-90}}}The Blessed One, attended upon by a congregation of many hundreds{{note:{index28,id:UT22084-056-006-91}}} of thousands of followers, was expounding the Dharma.{{note:{index29,id:UT22084-056-006-92}}} “Look, O monks, at these two good men, surrounded by followers, who are the heads of their assembly!”
“We see them, O Blessed One,” they replied.
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-056-006-94}}}The Blessed One foresaw, “Of these two good men who are here, along with their retinues, to enter the wandering mendicant’s life by my side, one will become the best of those endowed with insight among all the hearers, {K5} and the other will become the best of those endowed with miraculous powers.”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-056-006-95}}}One of the monks recited on that occasion the following stanza:
“These two learned men, along with their retinues,
Are prophesied to be benefited by the best of men
And to acquire miraculous powers and fearless insight.{{note:{index30,id:UT22084-056-006-97}}}
I welcome them both with a feeling of growing admiration.” {1.13}
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-056-006-98}}}The monk then got up from his seat and, together with many other monks, householders, and wandering mendicants, welcomed the two good men and honored them. The two men, for their part, moved near to the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, circumambulated him clockwise three times, and, standing before him, said, “Please allow us to go forth and bestow the monk’s ordination upon us. Close to you, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-056-006-1889,folio:F.191.b}}} {TK18} let us practice celibacy.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-056-006-99}}}“What are your names, O noble sons?” asked the Blessed One.
Upatiṣya replied, “I am the son of the brahmin Tiṣya, and so I am called Upatiṣya.{{note:{index31,id:UT22084-056-006-101}}} My mother’s name is Śārikā. As I was born of her, my given name is Śāriputra.{{note:{index32,id:UT22084-056-006-102}}} {K6} I already have my parents’ permission to go forth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-056-006-103}}}Kaulita replied, “My father’s name is Kauṇḍinya, and so I am called Kaulita. My mother’s name is Mudgalā, so the common name given to me is Maudgalyāyana. Some people know me as Kaulita, while others as Maudgalyāyana.{{note:{index33,id:UT22084-056-006-104}}} I already have my parents’ permission to go forth.”
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-056-006-105}}}“Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, and your retinues, you may live the holy life by my side,” said the Blessed One.
This is how they went forth and received their ordination as monks.{{note:{index34,id:UT22084-056-006-107}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-056-006-108}}}Not long after Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, and their retinues had gone forth, Māra, the evil one, assuming the form of Maheśvara, stood in front of the Blessed One and said:
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-056-006-109}}}“Those who convey{{note:{index35,id:UT22084-056-006-110}}} the meaning of systematic treatises and who have excelled in the fields of knowledge
Will all bow to my feet, as I am their guide.
You, Venerable Gautama, with your following of students, should promptly seek refuge in me today.
I will teach you the wide and clear{{note:{index36,id:UT22084-056-006-111}}} path to nirvāṇa.” {1.14}
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-056-006-112}}}The Blessed One replied: {K7}
“Your path brings misfortune to beings and leads them to the ocean of suffering.
My path dries up the ocean of suffering for both mobile and stationary beings.{{note:{index37,id:UT22084-056-006-114}}} {TK19}
What more then will you say, O arrogant and garrulous one with the voice of a jackal?{{note:{index38,id:UT22084-056-006-115}}}
You are exposed! It is not in your power to play Māra’s tricks on me again.” {1.15}
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-056-006-116}}}Māra, the evil one, then disappeared in his form of Maheśvara, and again reappeared in front of the Blessed One in the guise of Brahmā, saying:
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-056-006-117}}}“As you have crushed, by means of insight, action and afflictions, the sprouts of saṃsāra,
Why, O Sage, do you still endure discomforts in this world for the sake of beings in this way? {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-056-006-1890,folio:F.192.a}}}
Master, nowhere in this world is there a qualified recipient for what you offer.
Why do you not hurry to enter nirvāṇa, leaving all ailments behind? Now is the time!” {1.16}
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-056-006-118}}}The Blessed One replied:
“I can see peerless beings as numerous as the sand grains in the Gaṅgā 
Who require my guidance and will be liberated by me through compassion. {K8}
If people, be they of middling, superior, or the least capability, definitely need to be liberated,
Then why, O wicked one, do you give me the hypocritical advice that I should enter nirvāṇa?”{{note:{index39,id:UT22084-056-006-120}}} {1.17} {TK20}
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-056-006-121}}}Māra, the evil one, again became unhappy, dejected, and sullen. He vanished on the spot and went back to his abode. He sat there, sinking into despondency. Immediately, all the beings who inhabited Māra’s abode started asking one another, “What could be the reason that our great king just sits there, sinking into despondency? Nobody knows why.”
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-056-006-122}}}Then the five hundred daughters of Māra, wearing clothes and adornments most pleasing to the mind, brought flower garlands and unguents capable of giving supreme pleasure. They played celestial instruments with the most captivating sounds that totally thrill the mind, danced, and sang songs. With sounds of a great celestial orchestra composed of five types of instruments that amuse and delight, they stood in front of the evil Māra. But he, the evil one, stretched forth his arms and cried out, “Stop this noise! Stop this noise!”
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-056-006-123}}}At these words, the celestial nymphs fell silent for a moment, but then broke into song again, striking and strumming their instruments. At that, Māra, the evil one, once again threw up his arms and began to bellow. Seven times the nymphs began to sing, dance, and play instruments, in ways bound to give pleasure, and seven times Māra, the evil one, threw {K9} his arms in the air and hollered, “Stop this noise! Stop this noise!” Thus commanded, the nymphs fell silent. However, one nymph called Vidyudvalgusvarā bowed in the direction of the evil Māra and asked:
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-056-006-124}}}“O Lord, have you just seen an omen portending your death? {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-056-006-1891,folio:F.192.b}}}
Or has the world become engulfed in fire today?{{note:{index40,id:UT22084-056-006-125}}} {TK21}
Or have you discovered an enemy stronger than you in this world?
Why are you so sad? Why won’t you have fun?”{{note:{index41,id:UT22084-056-006-126}}} {1.18}
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-056-006-127}}}Māra replied:
“I have a powerful enemy who has tamed his mind.
On earth, the son of the Śākyas is trained to recognize magical tricks.
If he is not brought to ruin, then, one way or another,
He will empty my realm of desires.” {1.19}
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-056-006-129}}}The nymphs inquired:
“Lord, by what means, power, valor, and courage 
Can he be brought to final and complete ruin, here on this day? {K10}
Who could possess the power to dry up the ocean of craving
With its vast waters, the fetters of threefold existence?” {1.20}
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-056-006-131}}}Māra replied:
“His lassos are generosity, yogic discipline, intention, compassion, and aspiration.
His bow is armed with a supreme arrow aimed at the target of emptiness.
He gives instructions on how to totally extinguish conditioned existence,
Being predisposed to pacifying the pathways emerging from within saṃsāra.{{note:{index42,id:UT22084-056-006-133}}} {1.21}
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-056-006-134}}}“His pupils dwell in empty towns and villages, 
Deep in the forest, or in the mountain wilderness.{{note:{index43,id:UT22084-056-006-135}}}

They cast them in the direction of the Blessed One, by whose magical power these instruments {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-056-006-1892,folio:F.193.a}}} and so forth rained down onto Veṇuvana, and the daughters themselves, along with their retinues, could see it raining.

{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-056-006-139}}}The monks, however, became suspicious and asked the Blessed One, “How is it, O Blessed One, that such a marvelous and extraordinary rain, never seen or heard before, is showering upon Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana along with their retinues? What could be the cause of it? What is the occasion?”
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-056-006-140}}}The Blessed One replied, “It is not by the will of these two noble sons that this great rain of flowers and so forth is falling. Rather, it was released from the abode of the evil Māra by his five hundred daughters along with their retinues, {TK23} in order to worship me.

{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-056-006-154}}}However, Māra was unable to bind them. Why was that? Because these five hundred with their retinues{{note:{index50,id:UT22084-056-006-155}}} had been blessed by the Thus-Gone One.

“When one dwells upon the aggregates, elements, and sense bases, by analyzing them according to their characteristics and becoming attached to them, this is duality and it runs counter to omniscience.
{{milestone:{label:2.9,id:UT22084-056-006-240}}}“Duality is conceptualizing the nexus of one’s conduct and its fruits. Duality is conceptualizing the nexus of appropriation, becoming, and birth{{note:{index92,id:UT22084-056-006-241}}} of beings. Duality is conceptualizing the nexus of instruction, elucidation, discourse, terminology, and language. Duality is conceptualizing the nexus of knowledge consisting in eternalistic and nihilistic views, and subjects of knowledge. Duality is conceptualizing the nexus of notions that postulate a being, a vital principle, an individual soul, a person, an agent, or an instigator of action. Also, if somebody dwells upon and conceptualizes the nexus of this shore and the other,{{note:{index93,id:UT22084-056-006-242}}} {TK37} and of thoughts and delimitations, this is duality.
{{milestone:{label:2.10,id:UT22084-056-006-243}}}“My friends, if any person who seeks omniscience dwells upon, conceptualizes, speculates about, or gets attached to the analysis of the arising and cessation of the thoughts ‘I’ and ‘my’ throughout the three times, {{page:{number:22,id:UT22084-056-006-1902,folio:F.198.a}}} this is duality pertaining to omniscience.
“It is as if somebody {K27} would get hold of soil when they need fire, would get hold of fire when in need of drink, would get hold of a stone when in need of food, would get hold of garments when in need of flowers, would get hold of a corpse when in need of perfume, would get hold of rocks{{note:{index94,id:UT22084-056-006-245}}} when in need of clothes, and would get hold of space when in need of scented oils.

{{milestone:{label:2.11,id:UT22084-056-006-246}}}There was, seated among this assembly, a bodhisattva by the name Dhāraṇamati. Folding his hands in the direction of the Blessed One, he bowed and asked, “Is it possible to realize that which is inexpressible?”
{{milestone:{label:2.12,id:UT22084-056-006-247}}}“Only one who knows the inexpressible is realized,” said the Blessed One. “Therefore, O noble son, I will ask you something. Answer according to your degree of acceptance. If you are able to explain this, please do. Is there a substance, characteristic, or entity that is called ‘omniscience’?”
{{milestone:{label:2.13,id:UT22084-056-006-248}}} “If I were to say that there is,” replied Dhāraṇamati, “this would be an eternalist view. If I were to say that there isn’t, this would be a nihilist view. In the middle way nothing can be apprehended: omniscience neither exists nor does not exist. Perfect realization is the understanding of the nature that is unobstructed, unarisen, {TK38} unceasing, immeasurable, incalculable, without darkness,{{note:{index95,id:UT22084-056-006-250}}} and without light.”

“Perfect awakening, O Blessed One,” said the bodhisattva Vairocana, “is the state that is characterized neither by attainment nor nonattainment.

“Perfect awakening,” said the bodhisattva Padmagarbha, “is the state where one is not attached to either virtue or vice and, through entering profound acceptance, does not conceptualize ‘I’ or ‘my.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:2.19,id:UT22084-056-006-264}}}“Perfect awakening,” said the princely youth Candraprabha, “is the state where one realizes all phenomena to be the same as the reflection of the moon in water and perceives the nature of phenomena as neither increasing nor decreasing.”

One does not accumulate, {K30} lose, generate knowledge of, relinquish, destroy, diminish, or increase any phenomena. By not conceptualizing things, {{page:{number:25,id:UT22084-056-006-1905,folio:F.199.b}}} one stops the afflictions. It is by this single principle that one realizes omniscient wisdom.”

Mañjuśrī replied, “The following, noble children, are twenty methods for attaining omniscient wisdom.

{{milestone:{label:2.24,id:UT22084-056-006-276}}}“Omniscient wisdom is applied through fathoming the knowledge of the nature of the divisions of all letters, languages, sounds, speech, and descriptive words.

{{milestone:{label:2.25,id:UT22084-056-006-278}}}“It is so, Mañjuśrī!” exclaimed the bodhisattva Kautūhalika. “When one fully understands this profound Dharma principle, one does not see anyone who teaches the Dharma, anywhere it is taught, any meanings, words, and letters by means of which it is taught, or any Dharma that is taught. Nor does one consider which Dharma one should abandon, which to practice, or which to understand thoroughly. The one who can fathom the true nature of things as being inexpressible will realize omniscient wisdom.”
{{milestone:{label:2.26,id:UT22084-056-006-279}}}“Good! Good it is, O noble son!” said the Blessed One. “You have eloquently shown that the attainment of omniscient wisdom can only happen through this single principle. {TK43} Why is that? It is because all phenomena, when they are not mere imputations, have an ultimate reality of neither arising nor decaying. Their ultimate reality is the nonarising of either ignorance or nirvāṇa and the nonarising of either space or nirvāṇa.{{note:{index104,id:UT22084-056-006-280}}} Ultimately all phenomena are inexpressible.

Accordingly, having renounced their gross physical forms, they attained mental bodies. Another twenty-eight thousand beings also gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Eighteen trillion{{note:{index108,id:UT22084-056-006-285}}} gods and humans of many different types obtained the bodhisattva’s acceptance, {TK44} absorption, and various dhāraṇīs.

{{milestone:{label:2.29,id:UT22084-056-006-288}}}“This indeed ought to be understood as the karmic precondition,” the Blessed One agreed. And in order to remove the doubts of these astonished beings, he shared the following episode from one of his previous lives:

They were astonished, and gazed upon the Thus-Gone One, the sage of the Śākyas, with their palms joined together.

Through hearing the dhāraṇī, the five hundred daughters of Māra {{page:{number:35,id:UT22084-056-006-1915,folio:F.204.b}}} lost their female sex organs and grew the corresponding male organs. The same happened to infinite numbers of girls from the realms of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, pretas, piśācas, and kumbhāṇḍas. All of them became non-returners on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. For all of them, the karmic obstacle that would cause their being reborn as women in the future was {TK55} completely removed. 
{{milestone:{label:2.52,id:UT22084-056-006-337}}}All these women saluted the thus-gone Śākyamuni with folded hands and, in a strong voice, exclaimed, “Homage, homage to {K43} Śākyamuni, the miracle worker, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha! Please relate in full, O compassionate one, the episode from your past life that will explain how and why our womanhood has now disappeared and we have become men with complete male physiques. By the power of this miracle, this magical display, and our disenchantment,{{note:{index133,id:UT22084-056-006-338}}} we have now engendered a wish to attain unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Narrate, O Blessed One, this episode from your past life, with these countless gods and humans as witnesses.”
{{milestone:{label:2.53,id:UT22084-056-006-339}}}The blessed, thus-gone Śākyamuni then continued with the narration of his past life:
“Listen, good people! Together with Her Majesty Surasundarī, the chief queen of King Utpalavaktra, eighty-four thousand women from her retinue heard the Ratnaketu dhāraṇī from the thus-gone Splendorous with the Gentle Glow of Light and Fragrance. As soon as they heard it, {K44} their female sex organs disappeared, and the corresponding male organs appeared.

Having thus become a wandering mendicant, he engaged in inward contemplation and took delight in reciting prayers.
{{milestone:{label:2.55,id:UT22084-056-006-344}}}“At that time many tens of millions of beings wondered why their king, the universal monarch, had become a wandering mendicant. They remarked to each other, ‘That thus-gone one{{note:{index135,id:UT22084-056-006-345}}} is a rogue and a trickster who engages in the works of Māra.

For that reason we should now depart from this place so that we do not have to witness his stealing of sexual organs or hear his teachings.’
{{milestone:{label:2.56,id:UT22084-056-006-350}}}“Among those who were talking in this manner there was a soldier by the name of Kumārabhṛta. He said, ‘All my wives, daughters, and women of the harem {K46}{{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-056-006-1917,folio:F.205.b}}} had their female sex organs removed and male organs magically planted by that rotten monk. All of them had their heads shaven and were then given dyed robes by him. And I am left alone, lost in grief. Let us all gather together and go into the rugged wilderness where we will not hear the sound or talk of that fake and rotten monk who employs Māra’s snares. Let us reconnoiter first.’
{{milestone:{label:2.57,id:UT22084-056-006-352}}}“Enthusiastically, they all replied, ‘Let’s do so!’
“The soldier Kumārabhṛta then set forth together with those many tens of millions of individuals, who were full of doubt, to a place on the outer fringes of inhabited lands, deep in the rugged mountain wilderness. There, he lived the life of a sage, preaching the following doctrine to all those people:
{{milestone:{label:2.58,id:UT22084-056-006-353}}}“ ‘There is no liberation from saṃsāra and no ripening of the results of good or bad actions. There is, at this time, a monk who preaches nihilism—a vow breaker{{note:{index140,id:UT22084-056-006-354}}} {TK58} who indulges in the activities of Māra. Those who approach him for an audience, salute him, and listen to his teachings become mentally distracted. He shaves their heads, causes them to leave home, gives them dyed robes, and has them live in cemeteries. He forces them to beg and allows them to eat only once a day. Because of him their minds are warped by wrong views and they are continually upset. They are content to live in seclusion and make do without bedsteads. He also deprives them of sensory and erotic pleasures, dance, {K47} song, perfume, scented oils, ornaments, jewelry, and sexual relationships. He forbids them to drink liquor or wine and allows them to eat only a little. Doing such, he is an enemy of beings who preaches nihilism in the guise of a monk while engaging in the ways of Māra. I have exposed the acts of this monk, Gautama, which were previously unheard of and unseen.’
{{milestone:{label:2.59,id:UT22084-056-006-355}}}“Through this speech of Kumārabhṛta many hundreds of thousands of millions of beings fell for his evil views.
“Subsequent to this, the great monk Utpalavaktra heard that in a certain mountain wilderness {{page:{number:38,id:UT22084-056-006-1918,folio:F.206.a}}} there were people who not only were established on the wrong path themselves but also induced others to adopt the same distorted views and speak badly about the Three Jewels. He thought to himself, ‘If ultimately I don’t liberate those beings from the evil of their wrong views {TK59} and don’t establish them in the right views, then my life as a monk will have become worthless. How in this blind world will I realize, in the future, the unsurpassed and perfect awakening? How will I teach and ultimately liberate miserable beings caught in the snares of the four māras?’
{{milestone:{label:2.60,id:UT22084-056-006-357}}}“The great monk Utpalavaktra, steadfast, courageous, and compassionate, having then requested the thus-gone Splendorous with the Gentle Glow of Light and Fragrance’s permission, set forth on his journey to all those towns, villages, hamlets, and marketplaces located in the rugged mountain wilderness in the frontier areas. Traveling through all these places in the company of hundreds of thousands, he taught the Dharma to all those misguided beings. He made those beings turn away from the evil of their wrong views, set them on the path of the right views, and established them on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Some he established in the aspiration toward the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, some toward the vehicle of the hearers, and some he established in the fruit itself.{{note:{index141,id:UT22084-056-006-358}}} Some he induced to take up the life of renunciation. Some he established in the vows of a lay practitioner, some in the vows of fasting and abstinence, and some in the vows of the threefold refuge. To women {K48} he taught the Ratnaketu dhāraṇī, {TK60} thus preventing them from becoming women again and establishing them in the state of manhood.{{note:{index142,id:UT22084-056-006-359}}}

He brought them into the presence of the thus-gone Splendorous with the Gentle Glow of Light and Fragrance where they all, except for the soldier Kumārabhṛta, {{page:{number:39,id:UT22084-056-006-1919,folio:F.206.b}}} took up the life of renunciation. Kumārabhṛta, for his part, made the following aspiration:

Later, after he is born, may I terrorize and create obstacles for him when he plays as a child, learns arts and crafts, learns to read, enjoys amorous pastimes in the harem . . .{{note:{index144,id:UT22084-056-006-363}}} until he ascends to the seat of awakening.{{note:{index145,id:UT22084-056-006-364}}} Should he attain awakening, may I sabotage his teachings.’
{{milestone:{label:2.63,id:UT22084-056-006-365}}}“The great monk Utpalavaktra, however, through his great courage full of effort and painful sacrifice, managed to instill faith in the soldier Kumārabhṛta, who had been so determined in his aspiration. {K49} He made him turn away from the evil of his wrong views, taught him the perils of vice, and planted in him the aspiration to attain unsurpassed and perfect awakening. {TK61} Consequently, the soldier Kumārabhṛta, now tame and faithful, made the following wish:
{{milestone:{label:2.64,id:UT22084-056-006-366}}}“ ‘O most compassionate Utpalavaktra! At the time when you have attained unsurpassed and perfect awakening, may you provide me with the prophecy of my attaining unsurpassed and perfect awakening.’

He turned infinite hundreds of thousands of millions of beings away from the evil of their wrong views. He set infinite numbers of beings upon the three paths and established them in the fruits thereof.

From then on you have attended upon many thousands of buddhas and worshiped them with offerings. Having learned the Dharma from them, you made aspirations and practiced the six perfections. However, because of the bad action previously accumulated by you with your body, speech, and mind, you have endured suffering for many eons in the three miserable realms. It is only because of this karmic obscuration that you were born, in your present life, in the abode of Māra, the evil one.”
{{milestone:{label:2.68,id:UT22084-056-006-374}}}While these past events concerning the Ratnaketu dhāraṇī were being narrated by the blessed, thus-gone Śākyamuni, the female characteristics of the five hundred daughters of Māra vanished, and male ones appeared. {{page:{number:41,id:UT22084-056-006-1921,folio:F.207.b}}} They gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Infinite hundreds of thousands of millions of beings beyond count, including gods, humans, {K51} and asuras,{{note:{index150,id:UT22084-056-006-375}}} developed the wish to attain unsurpassed and perfect awakening and entered the path of no return. In this way, infinite hundreds of thousands of millions of beings entered the path of {TK64} no return of both the hearer and solitary buddha vehicles.

{{milestone:{label:3.1,id:UT22084-056-006-377}}}While the Ratnaketu dhāraṇī was being recited by the thus-gone Śākyamuni, the entire Sahā world became clearly visible, illuminated by a powerful light. The one hundred billion lords of sensual pleasure, each one a māra active in one of the one hundred billion worlds of four continents in this buddha field of Śākyamuni, became alarmed by this display of the Buddha’s power and directed their eyes toward this world of four continents. “Where is this light emanating from?” they wondered. “Surely this must be through the power of Māra, the evil one, who lives in that particular world of four continents. He is stronger, mightier, and more powerful than us.”
{{milestone:{label:3.2,id:UT22084-056-006-378}}}As they looked, however, the māras saw Māra, the evil one, overcome with grief{{note:{index151,id:UT22084-056-006-379}}} and utterly dejected. So the one billion māras went to the world of four continents where Māra, the evil one, lived and asked, “Why is it, O lord of sensual pleasures, that you are just sitting there, miserable and overcome with grief, when your entire world sphere is awash with light?” {K53}
{{milestone:{label:3.3,id:UT22084-056-006-380}}}Māra, the lord of sensual pleasures, {TK66} then explained the matter at length to the one hundred billion māras:
“As you know, friends, there is a monk from the Śākya clan, {{page:{number:42,id:UT22084-056-006-1922,folio:F.208.a}}} a trickster and rogue of the worst kind. As soon as he was born here, the entire Sahā{{note:{index152,id:UT22084-056-006-382}}} world became filled with light, shook, and trembled. Whatever intelligent beings there were in this entire world sphere—the lords of brahmās, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, mahoragas, garuḍas, kinnaras, and other intelligent human and nonhuman beings—all went to him to offer worship for the last six years. Sitting alone on his seat, without a companion, he has been creating inauspicious illusions.
{{milestone:{label:3.4,id:UT22084-056-006-383}}}“I, for my part, desirous to make a show of my military might, approached him in the company of soldiers numbering three hundred sixty billion and surrounded him with displays of power, valor, magical skill, and transformations of my entire army, but I was unable to stir or disturb even a single hair on his body, let alone dislodge him from his seat or assault him some other way. That villain, however, displayed the magical power that he did and made the earth tremble. 
{{milestone:{label:3.5,id:UT22084-056-006-384}}}“Defeated along with my military, I was like a cut-down tree, prostrate upon the surface of the earth, while he, {K54} sitting there on his seat, produced inauspicious illusions {TK67} of such a kind that my entire domain was overpowered. Having accomplished the knowledge he sought, he rose from his seat and started instructing beings. Thereupon, all the learned and knowledgeable beings in this world of four continents became astounded, so that I am unable to divine their thoughts or their future destiny within the six realms. I am unable to stir or disturb even a single hair of those who took refuge with him, let alone mislead them about him, or pry them away from him.
{{milestone:{label:3.6,id:UT22084-056-006-385}}}“And now my five hundred daughters with their retinues, as well as my twenty thousand sons with their followers, have taken refuge with that villainous monk, Gautama, and sit in front of him in order to listen to the Dharma,{{note:{index153,id:UT22084-056-006-386}}} while I no longer have the power to persuade them to leave him. For this reason, {{page:{number:43,id:UT22084-056-006-1923,folio:F.208.b}}} you, being powerful, full of merits, knowledgeable, and mighty, must help me. We need to stamp the life out of that villainous son of the Śākyas. And whatever beings have taken refuge with him, we must annihilate them too. {K55} We will defeat the black faction of that deceitful monk, and bring glory to the white faction of Māra. We will then be able to live happily ever after.”
{{milestone:{label:3.7,id:UT22084-056-006-387}}}Now, the māra Jyotiṣprabha looked toward Jambudvīpa where the Thus-Gone One {TK68} was sitting and teaching the Dharma. When he saw the Blessed One’s body and heard the sound of his Dharma talk, he was awed and the thrill of it caused the hairs on his body to stand on end. He said to Māra, the evil one:
{{milestone:{label:3.8,id:UT22084-056-006-388}}}“With his exquisite form, he stands supreme over the entire buddha field. 
He has long been purified through merit and wisdom.
Having applied himself to the path over a long time, he is free from the afflictions.

{{milestone:{label:3.10,id:UT22084-056-006-391}}}Then another māra, Sannimika by name, addressed Māra, the evil one, thus:
“He possesses great magical power and the excellent marks of merit.
Not stuck anywhere, he is free from all destinies.
He shows the way leading to the cessation of all suffering
And cannot possibly be harmed even by hundreds of māras.” {3.3}

{{milestone:{label:3.12,id:UT22084-056-006-395}}}The māra Navarāja said this to Māra, the evil one:
“If you had superior magical power,

Your force, however, is spent and all hope is gone.
Why, then, do you still compete with him, the Omniscient One?” {3.5}

{{milestone:{label:3.25,id:UT22084-056-006-424}}}And so this exchange between the evil one and the other māras continued until ten million stanzas were spoken by the ten million māras, after which all the māras spoke with a single voice: 
{{milestone:{label:3.26,id:UT22084-056-006-425}}}“So be it! We will go! We will now go to our individual abodes, don our armor, and come along with our military cohorts. {K60} Whatever magical powers we have at our disposal, we will display them all. You will then know for yourself, at that time, what valor the monk Gautama will exhibit.”{{note:{index160,id:UT22084-056-006-426}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.27,id:UT22084-056-006-427}}}These tens of millions of māras {TK72} then departed for their respective homes to don their armor, each māra accompanied by tens of thousands of millions of followers. All of them donned their coats of mail, armed themselves with different types of weapons, and girded themselves with different types of body armor. As night fell, they traveled to Jambudvīpa and arrayed themselves in the sky above Aṅga-Magadha.
{{milestone:{label:3.28,id:UT22084-056-006-428}}}Any gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, pretas, piśācas, and kumbhāṇḍas in this world of four continents who harbored ill will toward the Blessed One and who had not attained respect and devotion for him and were also ill-disposed toward the Dharma and the Saṅgha were all mobilized under the command of the evil Māra for the sake of killing the Blessed One. Brandishing various weapons and types of armor, they hovered there in the sky. Māra, too, went to one side of the Himalaya Mountains where there lived, {{page:{number:46,id:UT22084-056-006-1926,folio:F.210.a}}} with a retinue of five hundred, the sage Jyotīrasa, a devotee of Maheśvara who was accomplished in the eighteen branches of knowledge and who had attained excellence in the field of magical arts. Having assumed the form of Maheśvara, Māra stood before the sage and said:
{{milestone:{label:3.29,id:UT22084-056-006-429}}}“Born into the Gautama clan, the supreme sage has recourse to ordinary knowledge as well as the superknowledges. {TK73}
He lives in Magadha, where he is now doing alms rounds in the city of Rājagṛha. {K61}
You must engage him in conversation at length, being resolute in the pursuit of various topics.{{note:{index161,id:UT22084-056-006-430}}}
You will thus certainly obtain the mastery of the five superknowledges.” {3.18}
{{milestone:{label:3.30,id:UT22084-056-006-431}}}Having spoken this stanza, Māra, the evil one, disappeared right there and, having gone to his abode, declared the following to his retinue of māras:
“Please hear from me today what an incomparable scheme I have hatched:
Those of you who are endowed with magical powers should unreservedly engage the son of the Śākyas in a friendly conversation.
If you keep your great pride, particular to māras, in check, he will not see your deception.
If you continually say nice words, he will be kind to you as one of his disciples, just like a mother is with her children. {3.19}
{{milestone:{label:3.31,id:UT22084-056-006-433}}}“When his disciples finally go undistractedly to town, 
As they do every morning,{{note:{index162,id:UT22084-056-006-434}}} we will promptly captivate them
With the sweetest sentiments expressed through song and dance.
The bull of the Śākyas will surely lose his composure
When he hears about this event.” {3.20} {TK74}
{{milestone:{label:3.32,id:UT22084-056-006-436}}}Another māra said:
“We shall swiftly produce, outside of this town, many unpleasant sounds—
The wild and fierce sounds of lions, tigers, elephants, and camels, like roaring summer thunder. {K62}
We shall wait with our weapons at the ready, so that he will see the miraculous display with his own eyes.
Baffled, he will lose his magical power and flee, losing his bearings and sense of direction.”{{note:{index163,id:UT22084-056-006-438}}} {3.21}
{{milestone:{label:3.33,id:UT22084-056-006-439}}}Another māra said: 
“Standing in great numbers by the four gateways straddling the four main roads with contorted faces,
Brandishing various weapons—sharp spears, arrows, barbed missiles, and swords—
We shall attack from the sky with loud shrieks, releasing bolts from the clouds.
Terrified by the earthquakes, he will soon lose all control and meet his doom.” {3.22}
{{milestone:{label:3.34,id:UT22084-056-006-441}}}And, as far as the extent of the māras’ magical power would allow, they enacted everything in full. The Blessed One, however, turned this entire world sphere—the great trichiliocosm—into diamond. Subsequently no māras were able to make any sounds, and no mountains of fire stood in the four directions. {{page:{number:47,id:UT22084-056-006-1927,folio:F.210.b}}} There were no black clouds {TK75} and no unseasonable winds. No nāga was able to send even a single drop of rain—all this through the power of the Buddha’s blessing.
{{milestone:{label:3.35,id:UT22084-056-006-442}}}Around that time, in the morning, four great hearers put on their lower garments and robes and, bearing their alms bowls, entered the great city of Rājagṛha to beg alms. Venerable Śāriputra entered the city through the southern gate to beg alms. {K63} There, in the city, fifty māra youths, endowed with supreme youthful beauty, attired to resemble sons of distinguished personages, roamed about dancing and singing. They seized Venerable Śāriputra by both hands and pranced along the street. Dancing and singing, they urged him, “Dance, monk! Sing, monk!” 
Śāriputra replied, “Listen, friends, as I sing you a song that you have not heard before.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.36,id:UT22084-056-006-443}}}All the māra youths, moving onward, then sang the following in unison with Śāriputra:

They included many beings up to the countless Akaniṣṭha gods, who descended from their realm in infinite numbers and took their seats around the lotus to hear the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:3.100,id:UT22084-056-006-548}}}The same stanzas were overheard by Māra, the evil one. Looking around, he saw, in the middle of the street in the great city of Rājagṛha, the lotus from which these stanzas were issuing {K77} and, seated around the lotus to hear the Dharma, infinite hundreds of thousands of millions of people. He then looked up and saw the same lotus in every abode of the gods throughout the six realms of desire.

{{milestone:{label:3.101,id:UT22084-056-006-549}}}Consequently, Māra, the evil one, became even more frustrated, upset, and dejected. Covered in goosebumps and sweat, shivering, he flew up into the sky and, in a loud voice, angrily addressed the other māras:

{{milestone:{label:3.105,id:UT22084-056-006-556}}}Another māra said to the evil one:
“Listen to this beneficial advice from us. Do you really understand what your duty is
If, even though you’ve seen the ruin of your army, you still don’t want to make peace?
It is we who are in error, considering that the splendorous body of the Well-Gone One is a receptacle of good fortune,

“You have lost your way and are on a lowly course!

So that we don’t perish immediately.” {3.84}
{{milestone:{label:3.109,id:UT22084-056-006-565}}}Other māras said with folded hands:
“You, O evil one, have given up right conduct and delight in evil acts,

We should promptly go to the city of Rājagṛha, putting on a pleasant and peaceful appearance.{{note:{index200,id:UT22084-056-006-567}}}

{{milestone:{label:3.110,id:UT22084-056-006-568}}}There was a māra there in the sky called Ghoṣavati. He proposed in a loud voice:
“All of you together, please listen to my words in a spirit of devotion and friendliness.
Let us renounce our wrong views, bow down to him, and likewise pay homage with speech and mind.
Having renounced anger, may we be thrilled {{page:{number:56,id:UT22084-056-006-1936,folio:F.215.a}}} by the teachings of the Sage, with feelings of devotion{{note:{index201,id:UT22084-056-006-570}}} and faith welling up in us.
Let us go to the Buddha in person to seek the refuge so difficult to obtain; let us worship him today with devotion.” {3.86}
{{milestone:{label:3.111,id:UT22084-056-006-571}}}At this moment all the māras descended from the sky and constructed gates to the city of Rājagṛha from the seven gems. Some, taking on the appearance of universal monarchs, {TK91} stood in front of the Blessed One, making every effort to worship him. Some took on the appearance of Brahmā, some of Vaśavartin, some of Maheśvara, some of Nārāyaṇa, some of a Tuṣita god, {K80} some of Yāma, some of Śakra, and some of a god from the realm of the Thirty-Three. Some took on the form of Kumāra, Vaiśravaṇa, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, or Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and some, the form of the mundane Four Great Kings.{{note:{index202,id:UT22084-056-006-1872}}} Some took on the appearance of Sūrya, Candra, or Tāraka; some, the appearance of an asura, garuḍa, kinnara, or mahoraga; and some, the appearance of jewel mountains, golden ornaments, various gems, or jeweled trees. Some took on the appearance of a kṣatriya; some, the appearance of members of religions other than Buddhism; some, the appearance of the precious wheel,{{note:{index203,id:UT22084-056-006-572}}} the precious jewel, the elephant Airāvaṇa, Bālāha the king of steeds, or the precious consort; and some, the appearance of a respected merchant or a royal minister. Magically transformed into these forms, they stood in front of the Blessed One in order to worship him.

Some were dazzling white with a white complexion and adorned with bright red ornaments;{{note:{index205,id:UT22084-056-006-575}}} they floated in the sky holding yellow parasols, {TK92} banners, flags, and strings of pearls.{{note:{index206,id:UT22084-056-006-576}}} {K81} Some were bright red with a red complexion and adorned with ornaments{{note:{index207,id:UT22084-056-006-577}}} of a golden color. They floated aloft, holding blue parasols, banners, and flags. Some were red with a red complexion and rained down white pearls. Some were white with a white complexion and rained down red pearls. Some, magically appearing as celestial ṛṣis, rained flowers from the sky in great profusion. Some, appearing as the Blessed One’s hearers, rained divine fragrances of various kinds from the sky. Some, appearing as gandharvas, strummed various divine instruments. Some, appearing as celestial nymphs, sprinkled the ground with perfumed water from vessels made of various gems. Some, of obsidian-black complexion, burned incense of various fragrances. Some, appearing as gods, danced and sang. Some, of varying complexion, praised the Blessed One with their folded hands directed toward him. Some māras, and even their retinues, turned to face the direction where the Blessed One resided and, holding various jewels, offered them to him in worship. Some, having placed themselves by the upper windows of houses and buildings along the street or upon gateways, tall buildings, houses at crossroads of three or four roads, gates, trees, or palaces, were sitting there for the purpose of worshiping the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:3.113,id:UT22084-056-006-578}}}When Māra, the evil one, saw all those māras with their retinues going for refuge in the monk Gautama, he became even more rattled, frightened, and confused. Wailing aloud, he said: {K82}
{{milestone:{label:3.114,id:UT22084-056-006-580}}}“I have no friends anymore
And have today been deprived of all my glory. {TK93}{{page:{number:58,id:UT22084-056-006-1938,folio:F.216.a}}}
Separated now from my dominion,
I will make my final effort. {3.87}
{{milestone:{label:3.115,id:UT22084-056-006-1873}}}“I will cut down at its root
the lotus where all the beings went.
After cutting it, they will all be flummoxed—
this will be my last stand.” {3.88}
{{milestone:{label:3.116,id:UT22084-056-006-581}}}Having thus made up his mind, Māra, the evil one, descended from the sky, fast as wind, to the street where the lotus was, and, having crept up to its stalk, tried to uproot it but could not even touch it. He tried to cut the petals but could not even see them. He also tried to smash the pericarp with his fist but could not even grasp it. Just as lightning, or a shadow, can be seen but not grasped, in the same way he could see the lotus but not grasp it.
{{milestone:{label:3.117,id:UT22084-056-006-582}}}When he thus saw the lotus without being able to touch it or seize it, he tried to let loose a most horrific deafening cry in order to frighten the entire congregation, but this too he was unable to do. He tried further, with great vehemence and force, to strike the great earth with both his hands to make it shake, but was unable, in this case too, to touch it or to seize it. Just as someone wanting to hit the sky cannot reach it, in the same way Māra, the evil one, saw the earth but could not touch it or seize it.
{{milestone:{label:3.118,id:UT22084-056-006-583}}}He then thought, “If I could only punch the beings assembled here, or distract their minds.”{{note:{index208,id:UT22084-056-006-584}}} But while he could see these beings, {TK94} he was unable to touch or seize even one of them. Then Māra, the evil one, wept bitterly. Through the power of the Buddha, his entire body shook like a tree. {K83} With a tear-streaked face he looked in the four directions and lamented:
{{milestone:{label:3.119,id:UT22084-056-006-585}}}“This miraculous feat, performed by this monk today, will attract the entire world to him.
Because of my earlier delusion, I suddenly became dispossessed,
And I am now separated from my dominion, my merit,{{note:{index209,id:UT22084-056-006-586}}} and my strength.
My life is finished. Banished, I will promptly go to my abode, while I am still alive.” {3.89}
{{milestone:{label:3.120,id:UT22084-056-006-587}}}But even though he tried to go home, he could not. Frightened still more, he could only weep. He thought, “I am deprived of my magical power completely. Woe is me! May I not fall under the control of the monk Gautama! And may I now disappear, so that I do not die in front of him, my enemy. {{page:{number:59,id:UT22084-056-006-1939,folio:F.216.b}}} As no being should see me die in his buddha field, may I die as soon as I am out of the Sahā world buddha field.”
{{milestone:{label:3.121,id:UT22084-056-006-588}}}But still, he was unable to disappear from sight or flee in any direction, cardinal or intermediate. Instead, he perceived himself, still at the same location, tied around the neck with a fivefold noose,{{note:{index210,id:UT22084-056-006-589}}} and became even more upset and frightened. Howling in a raucous voice, he lamented, “Woe is me! I will never again see my dear sons or kinsmen.”
{{milestone:{label:3.122,id:UT22084-056-006-590}}}Then the māra by the name Ghoṣavati, seated in the manner of a universal monarch, asked Māra, the evil one: {K84}
{{milestone:{label:3.123,id:UT22084-056-006-591}}}“Sir, why are you today, in your anguish, loudly lamenting and crying?
Discarding fear, you should promptly go to the exalted sage, the best in the entire world, for refuge.
He is the protector, refuge, and defender of the world,{{note:{index211,id:UT22084-056-006-592}}} who removes the three sufferings.
Surely, if you devote yourself to him, you will obtain peace and happiness.” {3.90}
{{milestone:{label:3.124,id:UT22084-056-006-593}}}Māra, the evil one, then thought, “If I approach the monk Gautama, with pleasing words, to take refuge, I would then be freed from these fetters.” {TK95}
Bowing with folded hands toward the Blessed One, he said, “Homage to you, the most eminent person and the ultimate deliverer from birth,{{note:{index212,id:UT22084-056-006-595}}} aging, disease, and death! I herewith go to the Blessed Buddha to take refuge.” 
{{milestone:{label:3.125,id:UT22084-056-006-596}}}Then he continued:
“Release me from this unbearable, terrifying noose, O sage{{note:{index213,id:UT22084-056-006-598}}} and protector!
Today and henceforth, I take refuge with the Well-Gone One, the greatest and most important being.{{note:{index214,id:UT22084-056-006-599}}}
Having committed grave offenses against you when I was angry and blinded by my ignorance,
I confess all of them before you, taking you as my witness.” {3.91}
{{milestone:{label:3.126,id:UT22084-056-006-600}}}When Māra, the evil one, thus took refuge in the Blessed Buddha, saying pleasant words, he had the sense that he was released. But when he had the thought to escape from the assembly, he had the sense that his neck was once again bound by a fivefold noose. {K85}{{page:{number:60,id:UT22084-056-006-1940,folio:F.217.a}}} When he was again unable to go anywhere and thought, once again, of seeking refuge and protection from the Blessed One, he had the sense that he was released. Staying right in that spot, he had the sense of being bound and released seven times over.
{{milestone:{label:3.127,id:UT22084-056-006-601}}}This concludes the chapter on the taming of Māra, the third in the “Ratnaketu Sūtra” from the Great Collection. {K86} {TK96}
{{milestone:{label:4,id:UT22084-056-006-chapter-4}}}Chapter 4
{{milestone:{label:4.1,id:UT22084-056-006-602}}}When the four great hearers were, as described before, in the great city of Rājagṛha collecting alms, they were rudely accosted by the māra youths who urged them, “Dance, monk! Sing, monk!” When, subsequently, the great hearers, running along the street, sang their verses with lyrics that describe the path to nirvāṇa, this great earth trembled. At that moment many hundreds of thousands of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, inspired with faith in the Blessed One’s instructions,{{note:{index215,id:UT22084-056-006-603}}} said this, their faces awash with tears:

If beings now see this nonsense directed at his disciples,
How will they come to have faith?” {4.1}
{{milestone:{label:4.3,id:UT22084-056-006-605}}}Then, many hundreds of thousands of millions of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas,{{note:{index216,id:UT22084-056-006-606}}} and rākṣasas, their faces bathed in tears, approached the Blessed One. Standing before him, they said:

{{milestone:{label:4.5,id:UT22084-056-006-609}}}The Blessed One replied:
“If so, I will go there myself,
And, having defeated Māra and his mounted forces,{{note:{index217,id:UT22084-056-006-611}}}
I will put the whole of humanity
On the road to the city of nirvāṇa.” {4.3}
{{milestone:{label:4.6,id:UT22084-056-006-612}}}All those gathered there pleaded with one voice, “Do not go, O Blessed One! {{page:{number:61,id:UT22084-056-006-1941,folio:F.217.b}}} Have you not said before that the domains of the blessed buddhas, the māras, and the nāgas, and of the acts they commit, are inconceivable? Among all these domains, that of the buddhas is preeminent. The Blessed One can, while sitting right on his seat, defeat tens of millions of māras, explain tens of millions of Dharma treatises, dry up the ocean of afflictions, tear up the net of wrong views, and submerge tens of millions of beings in the ocean of wisdom. The time is not right for the Blessed One to go now.”
{{milestone:{label:4.7,id:UT22084-056-006-613}}}The Blessed One replied, “Even if all beings, however many there are in the inhabited realms, were to become māras, and if all the particles of dust, however many there are on earth, were individually mobilized by his power to advance toward me in order to take my life, they would not be able to harm even a single hair on my body. Whereas I, sitting on this very seat, would be able to defeat tens of millions of billions of māras, except for Māra himself along with his personal retinue. 
{{milestone:{label:4.8,id:UT22084-056-006-614}}}“I will go back so that the entire great city of Rājagṛha becomes adorned by the māras offering worship to me {TK98} with marvelous displays magically created by the power of Māra. I will use this event to inspire them with compassion, so that these māras, when supreme appreciation and faith are born in them, will create the roots of virtue necessary to realize unsurpassed and perfect awakening.” {K88}
{{milestone:{label:4.9,id:UT22084-056-006-615}}}When the Blessed One was thus about to get up from his seat, Prabhāvaśobhanā, the guardian deity of Veṇuvana, stood in front of him with a tearful face and insisted:
“This is not the right time, O Blessed One, to enter
The city that is presently crawling with māras.

This buddha field will be arranged just as the present-day world of Sukhāvatī is. You will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood in this buddha field. You will be a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, someone learned and virtuous, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who guides beings, an unsurpassed being, and a teacher of gods and humans. You will be known as the blessed buddha Immaculate Fragrant Star of Bright Splendor. Your lifespan will extend to an intermediate eon. There will be no hearers or solitary buddhas in your buddha field; it will be a realm exclusive to bodhisattva great beings. You will only give Great Vehicle teachings there.”
{{milestone:{label:4.151,id:UT22084-056-006-887}}}When the assembly that had amassed there heard the prophecy of the bodhisattva great being Jyotīrasa, they exerted themselves in venerating the Blessed One. The five hundred young brahmins and ninety-two trillion other beings there developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. They achieved the bodhisattva absorption called not forgetting the mind of awakening.
{{milestone:{label:4.152,id:UT22084-056-006-888}}}This concludes the chapter on the sage Jyotīrasa, the fourth in the “Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī.” {K108} {TK130}

{{milestone:{label:5.1,id:UT22084-056-006-889}}}The millions of māras then thought, “We should adorn the gates of the city through which the Blessed One is to enter, as well as the earth surrounding them, with sublime and magnificent ornaments in the same manner as the gods, nāgas, and yakṣas have adorned the surroundings of the city.”
{{milestone:{label:5.2,id:UT22084-056-006-890}}}With his mind, however, the Blessed One knew the thoughts of the millions of māras,{{page:{number:80,id:UT22084-056-006-1960,folio:F.227.a}}} and he manifested a miracle such that through the twelve gates of the city, twelve blessed buddhas entered the city of Rājagṛha. The millions of māras then, while hovering in the sky, adorned the city gates, the area around them, the city walls, its trees, and the surface of the earth with magical ornaments of the māra realm, as well as countless other magnificent miraculous manifestations set in the finest and most beautiful arrangements. Some of the millions of māras transformed into guises ranging from that of Brahmā to those of great sages. {TK131} From their perch in the sky, they placed various flowers, incense, scented powders, garlands, gold, silver, jewels, and pearls on the windows, ledges, and turrets of the mansions in the city, as well as in the trees. They also cast down a rain of cloth, cotton, linen, and ornaments, played many instruments, and venerated the Blessed One with songs of praise, extolling his qualities. The Blessed One then entered Rājagṛha’s city gates, adorned as they were with a supremely extensive and elevating display made in such a novel, incredible, and miraculous fashion. 
{{milestone:{label:5.3,id:UT22084-056-006-891}}}As he entered, he touched the threshold of the city gate with the big toe of his right foot. As soon as he did so, the entire great trichiliocosm shook in six different ways. This earthquake was felt by Śakra, Brahmā, Sūrya, Candra, the world protectors, and Maheśvara, as well as all leaders of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, and also by the gods of the earth, water, oceans, cities, {{page:{number:81,id:UT22084-056-006-1961,folio:F.227.b}}} and countryside. It was also felt by all the men, women, {TK132} boys, and girls and all the retinues of the divine great sages up to the Unexcelled Heaven. The earthquake immediately mobilized all these majestic beings to gather at the area surrounding the city of Rājagṛha. From the ground below and the sky above, they cast flowers and incense powder, suitable to the season, toward the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:5.4,id:UT22084-056-006-892}}}The Blessed One then scattered the flowers, powders, and so forth into each of the ten directions in order to venerate and honor the buddhas in all the buddha fields—pure as well as impure,{{note:{index295,id:UT22084-056-006-893}}} empty as well as not empty—that are as numerous as the atoms in existence. The following verses then rang out from the flowers, powders, and ornaments in those buddha fields:
{{milestone:{label:5.5,id:UT22084-056-006-894}}}“Quickly, wake up! Consider these things.
Act conscientiously for awakening.

{{milestone:{label:5.10,id:UT22084-056-006-899}}}Then the bodhisattva great beings, hearers, and great hearers who were settled in mental composure in the grove of Veṇuvana gazed at the Teacher. They saw that the Blessed One was at the gate of the city of Rājagṛha, calm and collected. {{page:{number:82,id:UT22084-056-006-1962,folio:F.228.a}}} All these bodhisattva great beings and great hearers also saw the ranks and formations {TK134} on the edges at the Blessed One’s sides.
{{milestone:{label:5.11,id:UT22084-056-006-900}}}The sound of the verses that came from the flower and powder decorations then rang out in the buddha fields—pure and impure, empty and not empty—as numerous as the atoms existing throughout the ten directions. When the bodhisattva great beings and hearers in those buddha fields heard the sound, they thought, “How pleasing this sound is. How enjoyable, delightful, satisfying, and pleasant it is. Its great qualities are indeed worthy of praise. Now, whence have this sound and this rain of flowers and powders come?” The bodhisattva great beings and great hearers thus halted their individual virtuous activities in utter amazement.
{{milestone:{label:5.12,id:UT22084-056-006-901}}}The blessed, thus-gone Śākyamuni then entered into an absorption called corresponding to the causes of the Buddha’s ornaments and jewelry. As soon as he entered this absorption, {TK135} an immense display appeared throughout this entire Sahā world and all the buddha fields throughout the ten directions. They all became just like the future thus-gone Samantadarśin’s buddha field, which is called Pure and Unstained. In all the buddha fields with their world systems as numerous as atoms, throughout the ten directions, that were all unconstructed{{note:{index296,id:UT22084-056-006-902}}} yet marvelously adorned, the blessed, thus-gone Śākyamuni appeared—clearly, precisely, and brilliantly—entering the city gates of Rājagṛha. {{page:{number:83,id:UT22084-056-006-1963,folio:F.228.b}}} As the bodhisattva great beings and great hearers in those buddha fields heard these sounds, they were intrigued. Gazing in all directions, they all saw the Sahā world—not very far away. Through the domain of the Buddha, they also saw the divine, miraculously created ornaments.
{{milestone:{label:5.13,id:UT22084-056-006-903}}}The bodhisattva great beings and great hearers then thought, “We should go to see and examine the presence of that great assembly and the qualities of the buddha field. We should go to see, venerate, and serve the thus-gone Śākyamuni. {TK136} There we will definitely receive our prophecies of unsurpassed and perfect awakening!”
{{milestone:{label:5.14,id:UT22084-056-006-904}}}Through the thus-gone Śākyamuni’s miraculous power, bodhisattva great beings and great hearers as numerous as the atoms in all the buddha fields throughout the ten directions then disappeared from their own buddha fields and arrived instantaneously in this Sahā world. When the countless, limitless bodhisattva great beings, who were as numerous as the atoms in all the buddha fields, arrived from each of the ten directions, they filled the earth and the sky above this buddha field entirely. Due to the power of the cause that is in accord with these bodhisattva great beings’ roots of virtue, they set out venerating the thus-gone Śākyamuni.
{{milestone:{label:5.15,id:UT22084-056-006-905}}}In order to venerate the Blessed One, some bodhisattva great beings covered the entire buddha field {TK137} with a rain of various flowers, while others cast down showers of pearls, and so forth. In order to venerate the Blessed One, yet others cast down showers of gold, silver, beryl, {{page:{number:84,id:UT22084-056-006-1964,folio:F.229.a}}} crystal, emerald, coral, white sandalwood, uraga sandalwood, and the powdered leaves of the palm tree, thus filling the sky. In order to venerate the Blessed One, others cast down a rain of dangling and swaying ornaments and various cloth and linens. In order to venerate the Blessed One, some held up jeweled parasols, banners, and flags. In order to venerate the Blessed One, some anointed the earth with various scents. Some tossed jeweled garlands. Some played instruments and cymbals. Some sang and danced. Some played music. Some cleansed the earth with scented water. Some bore jeweled vessels containing jewels to the Blessed One. Some {TK138} filled jeweled vessels with scented water, decorated them with flowers, fruits, and leaves, and bore them to the Blessed One. Some decorated jeweled trees with divine cloth, jewelry, flowers, and fruits and held them high.
{{milestone:{label:5.16,id:UT22084-056-006-906}}}Some transformed themselves into the guise of Mahābrahmā and prostrated to the Blessed One with palms joined together. Standing there, they made extensive offerings in the manner just mentioned. Some transformed themselves into the guise of lions, prostrated to the Blessed One, and took their places. Drawing on the Blessed One’s miraculous power and the strength of their own roots of virtue, the beings there were able to perceive one another’s forms unimpededly with their own eyes. The Blessed One then entered the city of Rājagṛha through the transformative power of the gods of the great māra realm, as well as his own{{note:{index297,id:UT22084-056-006-907}}} applications of mindfulness, right exertions, bases of supernatural power, faculties, strengths, limbs of awakening, {{page:{number:85,id:UT22084-056-006-1965,folio:F.229.b}}} paths, and eighteen unique qualities of a buddha. {TK139} He then proceeded to a lotus that was right in the center of the road, touched the head of the flower with his right palm, and picked it up. As he plucked the lotus, it vibrated, which caused all the encircling mountains, greater encircling mountains, Mount Sumeru, the great oceans, and all the māra realms in this buddha field to shake. The celestial palaces, abodes, beds, and seats in the māra realms also shook violently. All the māra boys and girls and their retinues there were terrified and worried and said to one another, “Since our celestial palaces do not shake for no reason, perhaps Māra, our king, has passed from his domain? What if we are also to die and pass from our home? We should definitely go to see what is happening!”
{{milestone:{label:5.17,id:UT22084-056-006-908}}}Once they saw what had happened, they thought, “If this buddha field is influenced by the five degenerations, who has then ornamented it so? Who has made it so pleasant?”
Then, as the māras and their servants were standing in that place, they saw the thus-gone Śākyamuni seated there—shining, {TK140} gleaming, brilliant, and adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being. They did not recognize even a single one of the many other beings of various forms, colors, characteristics, and shapes that existed in the whole trichiliocosm, including this entire buddha field. Yet they saw each of those beings exerting themselves in venerating the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:5.18,id:UT22084-056-006-910}}}It then occurred to them, “We must by all means go to see the thus-gone Śākyamuni, pay our respects to him, and ask him where our leader and his servants have gone.” {K108}{{note:{index298,id:UT22084-056-006-911}}}{{page:{number:86,id:UT22084-056-006-1966,folio:F.230.a}}}

{{milestone:{label:5.21,id:UT22084-056-006-917}}}The Blessed One replied:

Through his mastery of magical powers particular to a great brahmā, he took on a female form endowed with all the characteristics of supreme beauty and adorned with clothing, {TK181} ornaments, flowers, fragrances, and scented oils that exceeded in greatness even the celestial realms.

“Noble son,” replied the thus-gone Amitāyus, “if he had not confessed, he would have been reborn eighty-four thousand times as a woman completely suffused with sensuality.

{{milestone:{label:6.69,id:UT22084-056-006-1190}}}Also at that moment, a bodhisattva great being known as Voice of Mahābrahmā, who dwelled on the tenth bhūmi, was present. He was attended by all the brahmās, māras, śakras, and so forth, {TK188} as well as Vaiśravaṇa, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Maheśvara, {{page:{number:119,id:UT22084-056-006-1999,folio:F.246.b}}} Nārāyaṇa, and the lords of the gods and asuras. He had the finest and most radiant complexion and the most exquisite ornamentation. In the guise of a woman, with female characteristics and deportment, he was seated before the thus-gone Śākyamuni. As an act of venerating the blessed buddhas, he proffered a wish-fulfilling jewel in his hands. The bodhisattva great being Voice of Mahābrahmā stared at the thus-gone Śākyamuni with unblinking eyes. He stared at him like he was the only thing in existence—something indescribable and unidentifiable.
{{milestone:{label:6.70,id:UT22084-056-006-1191}}}The thus-gone Śākyamuni then asked Voice of Mahābrahmā, “Listen, why are you staring at me with unblinking eyes, as if I were the only thing in existence—something indescribable and unidentifiable? Is there any phenomenon that can be called ‘a buddha’ or ‘unidentifiable’? Likewise, the verbal elements in the statement ‘the afflictions of attachment, aggression, or delusion exist’ are merely conditional characteristics. The condition for such characteristics is ignorance. Due to the condition of ignorance, formations proliferate until cessation.”
{{milestone:{label:6.71,id:UT22084-056-006-1192}}}“Blessed One,” responded Voice of Mahābrahmā, “if all these do not exist, why do you speak to me of ignorance? Blessed One, if there were no ignorance, from what would the twelve links of existence arise? Can we say they come from space {TK189} when space itself does not exist?”
{{milestone:{label:6.72,id:UT22084-056-006-1193}}}“Noble son, that is correct,” answered the Blessed One, “for all the qualities of buddhahood are like space. Just as space is immaterial, is without characteristics, is neither darkness nor light, is neither thought nor concept, cannot be created or described, is unidentifiable, has no component parts, and has nothing to do with entities, likewise, O noble son, the qualities of buddhahood are {{page:{number:120,id:UT22084-056-006-2000,folio:F.247.a}}} deemed to be the ultimate reality because they are suchness. Because they involve no increase or decrease, the qualities of buddhahood are neither high nor low. Because they have no component parts, the qualities of buddhahood are indescribable. Because they do not move and cannot be placed anywhere, the qualities of buddhahood are not material or entities, and they have no characteristics. Because they transcend verbal description, the qualities of buddhahood are not superimposed, for it is from false conceptualization that the links of existence arise.”
When he gave this teaching, eighty-four thousand beings developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:6.73,id:UT22084-056-006-1195}}}Then Māra, the evil one, demanded, “If the qualities of buddhahood are indescribable non-entities, like space, then why do you harm me in this way—oppressing me with wisdom, diligence, means, and courage? Why do you destroy my Māra domain? Why do you lead beings from my Māra domain? Why do you instruct them in the nature of illusion, which neither comes nor goes nor is identifiable in any way? When you guide beings in these trainings, no conduct that produces the afflictions can be seen in them. {TK190} For what reason are you assembling all these countless, infinite blessed buddhas, bodhisattva great beings, great hearers, great brahmās, śakras, four world protectors, maheśvaras, and gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas who have magical might and power, thus filling all the buddha fields, to go against me? Anyone who hears of this cruel act will be immediately struck with a splitting headache; their bodies will decompose {{page:{number:121,id:UT22084-056-006-2001,folio:F.247.b}}} and begin to stink.

Our bodies started decomposing, began to stink, and we suffered terribly.”
{{milestone:{label:6.75,id:UT22084-056-006-1197}}}“Evil ones, remember what happened in the past!” countered the thus-gone Śākyamuni. “When I was sitting at the seat of awakening, you filled the area and the sky around me out to eighty leagues with the hordes of Māra, intent on killing me. And since that time you still send billions of māras and their retainers to kill me. Therefore, I have amassed a countless infinitude of blessed buddhas, bodhisattvas, and so forth, as well as human and nonhuman beings, in order to tame, pacify, and end your torment. I have done so in order to tame, pacify, and end all the suffering of other māras, and so forth, as well as human and nonhuman beings. I have done this to instruct them in the nature of illusion, which neither comes nor goes nor is identifiable in any way. I have done so to dry up the river of saṃsāra in which all beings die and are reborn, and to help them reach the expanse of nirvāṇa without any remainder of the aggregates. {TK191}

If you do so, you will immediately be freed from this unbearably painful headache, and ultimately you will actualize the qualities of buddhahood, which have the nature of space. You will even gain the superior domain of the buddhas, which far exceeds that of the māras.”
{{milestone:{label:6.77,id:UT22084-056-006-1199}}}The sixty-four thousand māras, the countless infinitude of their retainers, and the hostile yakṣas, and so forth, as well as the hostile kaṭapūtanas, all declared with one voice, {{page:{number:122,id:UT22084-056-006-2002,folio:F.248.a}}} “When we develop the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, we shall actualize the qualities of buddhahood, which have the nature of space, and win the domain of the buddhas as well, superior above all.”
“Even if I were to have a headache until the end of time,” insisted Māra, the evil one, “I would never let such cunning make me develop the mind directed toward awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:6.78,id:UT22084-056-006-1201}}}Voice of Mahābrahmā then declared, “I will also joyfully uphold all the Dharma teachings that have been taught before all the blessed buddhas here in this buddha field.

Then I will dispel all that is inauspicious, bad dreams, evil omens, hostility, cruelty, meanness, bad tastes, snow, heat, foul odors, and things that are unpleasant to touch and poisonous.

{{milestone:{label:6.86,id:UT22084-056-006-1212}}}This concludes the chapter on the dhāraṇīs, the sixth in the “Ratnaketu” section of the Great Collection. {TK197}
{{milestone:{label:7,id:UT22084-056-006-chapter-7}}}Chapter 7
{{milestone:{label:7.1,id:UT22084-056-006-1213}}}At that time, a bodhisattva great being called Discriminating Intellect was seated before the blessed, thus-gone {{page:{number:126,id:UT22084-056-006-2006,folio:F.250.a}}} Glorious and Brilliantly Shining Jewel, not far from the blessed, thus-gone Śākyamuni. For a short time he was in the guise of Brahmā, before instantaneously appearing in the form of Māra. He likewise briefly appeared in the forms of Śakra, as well as a lord of the gods in the heavens of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, Delighting in Emanations, Tuṣita, Free from Strife, and the Four Great Kings, as well as in the form of Maheśvara, and also as a yakṣa, an asura, a garuḍa, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a rākṣasa, a preta, a piśāca, a kumbhāṇḍa, a kṣatriya, a brahmin, a vaiśya, a śūdra, a lion, an elephant, a buffalo, and myriad other species of the animal realm. Instantaneously he appeared in the form of a bird, a tree, a mountain, fruit, clothing, bedding, heavy cloth, a vase, ornaments, jewelry, medicinal herbs, and a jewel. Instantaneously he also appeared in the form of a monk, a nun, and a buddha. Instantaneously he appeared in eighty-four different colors, characteristics, shapes, and forms.
{{milestone:{label:7.2,id:UT22084-056-006-1214}}}Then Pūrṇa, the son of Maitrāyaṇī, asked the thus-gone Śākyamuni, “Blessed One, what is the cause and what are the conditions {TK198} of this noble son shifting his appearance among eighty-four different colors, characteristics, shapes, and forms?”
{{milestone:{label:7.3,id:UT22084-056-006-1215}}}“Venerable Pūrṇa, this noble son has incredibly great power,” responded the Blessed One. “The bodhisattva great being Discriminating Intellect matures beings while abiding by the power of his pledge. With the unobscured eyes of insight, in countless infinite buddha fields throughout the ten directions, both pure and impure, he can see beings and their kinds of thoughts, intentions, actions, and illnesses and where {{page:{number:127,id:UT22084-056-006-2007,folio:F.250.b}}} they go for refuge. Abiding in this type of absorption, he adopted forms ranging from bodhisattvas to buddhas as well as colors, characteristics, actions, shapes, and forms as was necessary to guide beings and establish them at the point where they will not revert from the three vehicles. To ensure that beings who are overwhelmed by their desire, hankering after all kinds of possessions and enjoyments, could eliminate their attachment, he gave them possessions and established them at the point of irreversibility. He distributed medicine to those who were afflicted with illness and desired a cure, and he established them at the point of irreversibility. The bodhisattva Discriminating Intellect freed beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā in a single day. This power of his pledge to establish {TK199} them at the point where they will not revert from the three vehicles is not the domain of the hearers or solitary buddhas. They do not reach this far.”
{{milestone:{label:7.4,id:UT22084-056-006-1216}}}“Blessed One, how long has this noble son exercised this great power for the sake of bringing beings to maturity?” asked Pūrṇa.
“This noble son developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening in the furthest reaches of eons past,” answered the Blessed One. “It was countless eons ago—as many as there are particles of dust in all the buddha fields. By now, sixty-four immeasurable eons have passed since the eon when that bodhisattva Discriminating Intellect began exercising this power by means of the strength of his absorption.”
{{milestone:{label:7.5,id:UT22084-056-006-1218}}} “How long will it be until he fully awakens to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood?” Pūrṇa asked.
The Blessed One answered, “After two million six hundred thousand great eons have passed, in a great eon called Liberation,{{note:{index415,id:UT22084-056-006-1220}}} there will be a buddha field called Heart of the Jewel. {{page:{number:128,id:UT22084-056-006-2008,folio:F.251.a}}} There the lifespan of beings will be forty thousand years. He will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood among beings {TK200} who are inclined toward acts ranging from those of immediate retribution up until the ten nonvirtuous actions. He will be known as the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Light of the Limitlessly Blossoming Flower. He will perform all the deeds of a buddha without exception for forty thousand years. He will mature beings in the three vehicles so that they may reach parinirvāṇa, following which he himself will enter parinirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa without the remainder of the aggregates.”
{{milestone:{label:7.6,id:UT22084-056-006-1221}}}Pūrṇa then asked, “From where do this sublime being’s deeds that mature beings manifest?”
“This great being’s aspirations are without bias,” answered the Blessed One. “He made this aspiration: ‘The blessed buddhas clearly see as many buddha fields as there are particles of dust in all the buddha fields in each of the ten directions. Therefore, I too will not fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood until I see those beings that I, while I previously practiced awakened conduct, caused to initially arouse the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, {TK201} take hold of it, practice the six perfections, and fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood in buddha fields in each of the ten directions. Through this type of power, based on absorption, may all beings in all buddha fields—as many as there are atoms in all the buddha fields in each of the ten directions—and in any other realm {{page:{number:129,id:UT22084-056-006-2009,folio:F.251.b}}} who are inclined toward acts ranging from those of immediate retribution and doubt up until the ten nonvirtuous actions, be reborn in my buddha field after they pass away. Then, may I always use this great power to manifest as a bodhisattva in order to arouse roots of virtue in these beings, establish each of them at the level of irreversibility, and ensure that they fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:7.7,id:UT22084-056-006-1223}}}Then the bodhisattvas who had congregated from buddha fields in the ten directions {TK202} said, “Those bodhisattvas who have come to this buddha field have gladdened such teachers. Seeing this great assembly of bodhisattvas endowed with great compassion, we have received an excellent and unprecedented opportunity to receive the blessings of the blessed buddhas of the past, present, and future. Thus, we received this Dharma method, this exposition of the dhāraṇī-seal, including its verbal formula, which is called the terminator of birth based on the essential nature of phenomena in their vajra-like indivisibility. How fortunate we are!”
{{milestone:{label:7.8,id:UT22084-056-006-1224}}}This concludes the chapter on upholding the sacred Dharma, the seventh in the “Ratnaketu” section of the Great Collection. {TK203}
{{milestone:{label:8,id:UT22084-056-006-chapter-8}}}Chapter 8
{{milestone:{label:8.1,id:UT22084-056-006-1225}}}At that time, the thus-gone Akṣobhya addressed the entire assembly: “Noble children, all of you śakras, brahmās, world protectors, and lords of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and so forth, as well as human and nonhuman beings, who have arrived here out of faith in the buddhas’ teaching—I will uplift you! It is rare to find such a congregation of the blessed buddhas, bodhisattva great beings, śakras, {{page:{number:130,id:UT22084-056-006-2010,folio:F.252.a}}} brahmās, world protectors, and lords of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and so forth, as well as human and nonhuman beings! Therefore, now that you have seen this, may those of you who are happy to sustain this sacred Dharma—this Dharma method—and propagate the lineage of the Three Jewels in the future in this buddha field each make an aspiration before the Blessed One.” {TK204}
{{milestone:{label:8.2,id:UT22084-056-006-1226}}}At that time a māra named Flower Mendicant filled a bucket made of the seven precious substances to the brim with flowers, fruits, crops, and sprouts and transformed himself into a buxom lady with a fine complexion. Dressed in women’s clothing and adorned with fine jewelry, the māra said, “All of you blessed buddhas who have come to this buddha field and now abide within it, and all the rest of you who have gathered here, please give me your attention! As I offer this wide cauldron filled to the brim with all manner of flowers, fruits, crops, and sprouts to all the blessed buddhas, out of compassion for all beings please accept this bucket filled with all manner of flowers, fruits, crops, and sprouts. In this way I will then become a female benefactor in every buddha field without exception throughout the entire Fortunate Eon, one who provides others with food, drink, fruits, and flowers. {TK205} I will bring them to maturity too. Through this ripening of merit, I will complete the six perfections and fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. The beings I train will never lack supplies, {{page:{number:131,id:UT22084-056-006-2011,folio:F.252.b}}} and I will serve them well. Toward that end, please bestow, right now, the accomplishment that fulfills my wishes.”
{{milestone:{label:8.3,id:UT22084-056-006-1227}}}Then all the blessed buddhas said, “Sublime being, it is excellent that, out of such faith, you have performed such an excellent and lofty act of generosity and venerated all the buddhas. We accept your cauldron filled with flowers and fruits. You shall find all the flowers, fruits, grains, or crops that you wish for. Simply by bringing your wish to mind, it will be fulfilled. May you possess an abundance of flowers, fruits, and grains. May you have abundant wealth.” {TK206}
{{milestone:{label:8.4,id:UT22084-056-006-1228}}}The māra Flower Mendicant spoke again: “Whether in villages, towns, cities, or border towns, I will be anywhere this dhāraṇī, which the hosts of Māra cannot defeat, is held, taught, explained, or written down. I will ensure the success of everything from the flowers and fruits of their trees to their grain and harvests. I will satisfy all the beings who desire flowers and fruits in those places. Therefore, blessed ones, except in the case of active violence, if there comes a time when there is a being in such a place who dies for want of the flowers and fruits that they desired, then I have deceived all the blessed buddhas in the three times and this great assembly. In that case, may I not fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. {{page:{number:132,id:UT22084-056-006-2012,folio:F.253.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:8.5,id:UT22084-056-006-1229}}}“Any being there who desires flowers and fruits will be the cause of my completing the perfection of generosity. Blessed ones, having desired flowers and fruits, should any of those beings have an altruistic, amiable, or compassionate attitude toward one another, that will be the cause of my completing the perfections of discipline {TK207} and patience. Should any of them come to practice diligence, having desired flowers and fruits, that will be the cause of my completing the perfection of diligence. If they develop the perception that the mind and mental states are impermanent, that will be the cause of my completing the perfection of concentration. If, having desired flowers and fruits, even birds or wild animals should come to desire the Dharma and abide in emptiness, that will be the cause of my completing the perfection of insight. Moreover, wherever this Dharma teaching spreads, I will assiduously grant everyone whatever crop they desire, be it fruit, wheat, barley, sesame, white lentils, black lentils, peas, horse gram, red lentils, or beans. I will fill all treasuries and granaries with all kinds of grains and harvests. Should even birds or wild animals desire anything, that will be the cause of my completing the perfection of insight. I will ensure there is plenty of sugarcane, grapes, and pomegranate plants there. I will fill all the beings’ pots, vases, and ladles. {TK208} When even birds or wild animals desire something, that will be the cause of my completing the perfections up to insight. {{page:{number:133,id:UT22084-056-006-2013,folio:F.253.b}}} Having completed the six perfections in this manner, I will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. All of you blessed buddhas and bodhisattva great beings, I request you to take delight in this, my bodhisattva conduct.”
{{milestone:{label:8.6,id:UT22084-056-006-1230}}}The blessed buddhas expressed their approval by remaining silent. The thus-gone Jñānaketu then declared, “Sublime being, you will be able to enact this great power. Sublime being, do look after all beings with that kind of strength, diligence, enthusiasm, and gentleness.”
{{milestone:{label:8.7,id:UT22084-056-006-1231}}}When the māra Flower Mendicant heard this encouragement from the thus-gone Jñānaketu, he said, “Blessed buddhas, please give me your attention. I will not dwell where this Dharma teaching is not practiced, but only wherever it is practiced. {TK209} I will ensure that all the grain, herbs, fruits, and flowers that exist in that place are resplendent, bountiful, plentiful, delicious, and colorful, so that people may savor them and enjoy them. I will satisfy people there with food and drink. I will fill their treasuries, granaries, pots, vases, and ladles. Should even the birds or wild animals desire something, that will be the cause of my completing the perfection of insight. I will satisfy the beings here in this buddha field for a thousand eons with food and drink. Likewise, I will perform this great power for a thousand eons in each and every one of the infinite, countless buddha fields, as numerous as the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā, that are afflicted {{page:{number:134,id:UT22084-056-006-2014,folio:F.254.a}}} and ripe with the five degenerations. Then, as I fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, all my deeds shall be perfected. Please bestow upon me this accomplishment. Blessed ones, the following mantra {TK210} effects summoning according to one’s personal aspiration:

The blessed buddhas all expressed their approval to him. All the bodhisattva great beings, Māra and his entire retinue, the śakras, the brahmās, and all the world protectors, as well as all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, and human and nonhuman beings in this buddha field expressed their approval with one voice, saying, “Sublime being, it is excellent that you bring beings to maturity in the form of a woman and engage in the six perfections. May we all achieve this kind of power through our own merit, {{page:{number:135,id:UT22084-056-006-2015,folio:F.254.b}}} diligence, strengths, and bravery!”
{{milestone:{label:8.10,id:UT22084-056-006-1235}}}The thus-gone Śākyamuni then said, “May you be joyful supporters who assist this sublime being.”
The entirety of the māra Flower Mendicant’s retinue then declared with one voice, {TK212} “For this purpose, we will be this being’s followers, associates, and harmonious assistants. Sublime being, when you fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, please bestow prophecies of our attaining unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:8.11,id:UT22084-056-006-1237}}}“Friends, may this come to be!” agreed the māra Flower Mendicant. “When a being plants a seed in the earth and enjoys its flowers, fruit, and fragrance, may this bring us happiness and benefit!”
{{milestone:{label:8.12,id:UT22084-056-006-1238}}}The māra Flower Mendicant then addressed the thus-gone Śākyamuni: “I will uphold your teachings and spread your Dharma methods. First and foremost, I will assiduously apply myself to eradicating all calamities involving famine. Blessed One, please bestow a prophecy of unsurpassed and perfect awakening upon me.”
{{milestone:{label:8.13,id:UT22084-056-006-1239}}}The māra Flower Mendicant then bowed to the thus-gone Śākyamuni, touching the five points of his body{{note:{index416,id:UT22084-056-006-1240}}} to the ground, and sat to one side. The thus-gone Śākyamuni then said to him:
{{milestone:{label:8.14,id:UT22084-056-006-1241}}}“Heroic heir of the well-gone ones, O lotus face, stand!
You have today made the essential aspiration to supreme awakening.
Arousing your compassion, sole kinsman, you will liberate beings tormented {TK213}
By the suffering of hunger, and then you will accomplish buddhahood. {8.1}
{{milestone:{label:8.15,id:UT22084-056-006-1242}}}The nature of phenomena is that they are immaculate, just like space.
They are emptiness and utterly transcend the domains of signs and wishes.
Realizing this, {{page:{number:136,id:UT22084-056-006-2016,folio:F.255.a}}} you will soon become a buddha called Splendor—
A wise being who tames all enemies in this buddha field with his vast teaching.” {8.2}
{{milestone:{label:8.16,id:UT22084-056-006-1243}}}Extremely pleased and delighted, the māra Flower Mendicant cast a variety of flowers toward the blessed ones. 
At that time, the bodhisattva great being Siddhimati rose from his seat. Joining his palms, he spoke in a clear voice to the blessed buddhas in this buddha field: “Blessed buddhas, please give me your attention! Once, at the beginning of the Fortunate Eon, I made an aspiration before the thus-gone Krakucchanda so as to be able to bring beings to maturity. In a female form, I extracted the nectar of the earth by searching among herbs and roots in order to heal the four hundred and four illnesses.{{note:{index417,id:UT22084-056-006-1245}}} {TK214} Thus, in order to make beings happy and free from illness, I demonstrated how to prepare one thousand and four sets of medicinal treatments. These included four hundred and four medicinal extracts, four hundred and four herbal medicines, four hundred and four medicines made from fruits, four hundred and four applications made from butter, four hundred and four applications made from seed oil, four hundred and four cleansing treatments, four hundred and four medicines known as ‘good health,’{{note:{index418,id:UT22084-056-006-1246}}} and so forth, as well as treatments ingested in the form of powders, pills, and aromas.{{note:{index419,id:UT22084-056-006-1247}}} In order to bring beings to maturity, heal their illnesses, and benefit them, I acted in various functions as the thus-gone Krakucchanda’s attendant, serving him, and from him sought a prophecy of unsurpassed and perfect awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:8.17,id:UT22084-056-006-1248}}}“The thus-gone Krakucchanda then declared to me, ‘In the future, when beings’ lifespan is a hundred years, there will be one called Śākyamuni who will be called a blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha. {{page:{number:137,id:UT22084-056-006-2017,folio:F.255.b}}} From the previous aspirations of this thus-gone one, a great gathering of buddhas and bodhisattvas will manifest. Then you will receive a prophecy of unsurpassed and perfect awakening.’ Later, this was mentioned by the thus-gone Kanakamuni and then by the thus-gone Kāśyapa as well. 
{{milestone:{label:8.18,id:UT22084-056-006-1249}}}“And so I aspired, ‘At that time, may I {TK215} become a great healer, a god who can extract for sick beings the essences in this buddha field for great eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā. There I will also take up the vast essence of the earth, seeking among the various grasses, roots, leaves, petals, flowers, and fruits to heal the diseases of beings and be of use to them. Then, whenever a person who has prepared these medicines comes to understand that the mind and all mental states are impermanent, suffering, empty, and selfless, may this be the cause for my completing the perfection of insight. To the degree that I manifest this great power in this buddha field, may I, in a female form, ripen and serve diseased beings in worlds throughout the ten directions as numerous as the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā, for as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā, with great enthusiasm, strength, diligence, and gentleness. Through this may I awaken fully and completely to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.’ {TK216}

May I be the assistant of the greatly fortunate, victorious, and reliable Flower Mendicant. {{page:{number:138,id:UT22084-056-006-2018,folio:F.256.a}}} We will both bring beings to maturity while in the guise of female forms bearing the same complexion. We will ripen women. Blessed ones, furthermore, for the sake of healing the diseases of the old and sick, the two of us will prepare food and drink replete with color, scent, and taste extracted from the essence of the earth. In doing so, may that become a cause for us to complete all the perfections up to insight.
{{milestone:{label:8.20,id:UT22084-056-006-1251}}}“So, when I ask whether I will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, I implore you blessed buddhas to give your assent. Blessed buddhas, please bestow a prophecy of unsurpassed and perfect awakening upon me.”
The blessed buddhas then said, “Good, good, O sublime being.”

All of them made aspiration prayers to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening in order to bring beings to maturity while in female form and to be able to ripen women. Why was this? It is because it is very easy for someone who has male genitalia to acquire female genitalia, whereas it is very difficult for someone who has female genitalia to acquire male genitalia. They each individually received a verse of prophecy.
{{milestone:{label:8.37,id:UT22084-056-006-1271}}}At that time, billions of gods and great nāgas also desired prophecies.

Moreover, a countless infinitude of humans and nonhumans, and likewise gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, pretas, and piśācas that had not previously generated the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, developed it. Countless beings came to abide at the stage of irreversibility. Countless beings achieved the various absorptions, acceptances, and dhāraṇīs of bodhisattvas. Countless beings achieved the result, were freed from desire, and exhausted their defilements. Countless beings aroused their minds away from the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas and came to abide on the stage of irreversibility within buddhahood itself.
{{milestone:{label:8.38,id:UT22084-056-006-1272}}}All of these beings then declared with one voice, “We all will uphold this sacred Dharma just as the blessed buddhas have commanded.

These noble children will satisfy others with clothing, food, drink, medicine, and supplies. They will use the female form to mature others for unsurpassed and perfect awakening. From the moment they developed the mind of awakening in order to mature others, they have been dedicated to emanating and providing clothing, food, drink, medicine, and supplies to fulfill their hopes—no matter what, why, or how these things are desired. These sublime beings will enact this great power and be able to serve beings with what is enjoyable and useful.”

We will be able to accomplish unsurpassed wisdom. We will joyfully uphold this mantra {TK226} with great zeal in order to bring beings to maturity. Additionally, out of compassion for beings, we will each live by our own pledges that we made before the thus-gone ones. Should any god, nāga and so forth, or human being attempt to extinguish, destroy, or ruin this Dharma method which the thus-gone ones have blessed, then should we then fail to repel them or act assiduously against them so that the sacred Dharma may long remain, we will have deceived all the blessed buddhas who course through the three times.

In that case, may we not fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood! Blessed ones, should any noble son or daughter who seeks awakening be threatened by fire, {TK227} water, poison, weapons, evil spirits, or infectious diseases that last one, two three, or four days or be threatened by or scared of any gods, nāgas, yakṣas, kaṭapūtanas, kṣatriyas, brahmins, vaiśyas, śūdras, lions, tigers, diseases, hunger, thirst, or harm of any kind, if they recall this dhāraṇī mantra, which fulfills all wishes and is blessed by all the buddhas, and we do not deliver them from such threats—except for those brought on by their own past karmic obscurations—then we will have deceived all the blessed buddhas who course through the three times.

They excellently blessed this sacred Dharma method. They defeated billions of māras and gazed upon all beings with the eyes of great love and compassion. They freed them from evil views, lit the lamp of insight, and laid out the peaceful path. They delivered this Dharma discourse, this exposition of the dhāraṇī-seal, including its verbal formula, which is called the terminator of birth based on the essential nature of phenomena in their vajra-like indivisibility. Thus they defeated the black faction and planted the banner of the Dharma. In the same way, right now, so many of us blessed buddhas who live and spend our time in the ten directions have assembled in this buddha field filled with the afflictions and the five degenerations out of our concern for others. We have performed acts such as excellently blessing this Dharma method and so forth, as well as planting the banner of the Dharma.

I will cause them to develop faith and embrace the training and will thus establish them on the auspicious path. I will teach the Dharma also to those yakṣas born in animal forms such as deer, antelope, pigs, and so forth, until I have brought to maturity, by means of the Dharma instructions, as many wicked yakṣas as there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā, including also those in animal forms that have not planted the roots of virtue.

At the same moment, the beings of this entire assembly, who were on earth as well as in the sky, shuddered, and so did the entire earth. A rain of flowers poured from the sky, millions of instruments resounded in midair, and all kinds of fragrances of perfume and incense were released. As the entire buddha field filled with light, those in the assembly pressed their hands together. Then Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, asked the thus-gone Mahācandanagandha, “How many roots of virtue, O Blessed One, will those beings accumulate who in the future uphold and preserve this Dharma discourse—who read it, master it, and teach it authentically and extensively to others?

(9) At the time of dying they will perceive standing in front of them innumerable blessed buddhas, passing their time in the company of their retinues of monks and the hosts of bodhisattvas and explaining the Dharma. They will hear the Dharma that is being thus explained complete with its meaning, words, and letters. {{page:{number:178,id:UT22084-056-006-2058,folio:F.276.a}}} (10) To ensure that they obtain spiritual joy and grace—noble and distinguished in every respect—all the karmic obstacles of nonvirtue {K174} will be extinguished in their last moment of consciousness at the time of dying, in accord with the Dharma.
