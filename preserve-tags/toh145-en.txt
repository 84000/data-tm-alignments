{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-057-004-68}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on the Vulture Peak of Rājagṛha, seated together with a great gathering of fully ordained monks, all of whom had perfected virtuous  qualities, roared mighty lion’s roars as great teachers, and were expert in seeking an immeasurable accumulation of gnosis, in all more than a thousand fully ordained monks.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-057-004-69}}}A great gathering of bodhisattvas was also assembled there, including the bodhisattva great being Samanta­bhadra, the bodhisattva great being Ratna­mudrā­hasta, the bodhisattva great being Nityodyukta, the bodhisattva great being Ornamented by Good Qualities, the bodhisattva great being Announcing Merits, the bodhisattva great being Mahāmati, the bodhisattva great being Array of Good Qualities,  the bodhisattva great being Vajra Intelligence, the bodhisattva great being Vajragarbha, the bodhisattva great being Light of a Vajra, the bodhisattva great being Weapon of a Vajra, the bodhisattva great being Adamantine Vajra, the bodhisattva great being Dhāraṇī­dhara, the bodhisattva great being Dhāraṇī­mati, the bodhisattva great being Seeing All Purposes, the bodhisattva great being Avaloki­teśvara, the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāmaprāpta, the bodhisattva great being Dṛḍhamati, the bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi, the bodhisattva great being Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta, the bodhisattva great being Avoiding Evil Destinies, the bodhisattva great being Overcoming All Sorrow and Darkness,  the bodhisattva great being Suvikrānta­vikrāmin, the bodhisattva great being Not Taking or Rejecting, the bodhisattva great being Essence of Sandalwood, the bodhisattva great being Sāgara­mati, the bodhisattva great being Durabhi­sambhava, the bodhisattva great being Arising Joy, the bodhisattva great being Intelligence of Conduct, the bodhisattva great being Pratibhākūṭa, the bodhisattva great being Essence of Speed, and the bodhisattva great being Maitreya.{{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-057-004-2571,folio:F.34.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-057-004-70}}}Those and other bodhisattva great beings all dwelled in inconceivable emancipation, had left everything behind through the meditative absorption heroic progress,  had unimpeded melodic voices, and were skilled in holding sway over limitless buddha realms. They all dwelled in fearlessness, were devoid of attachment and anger, possessed pleasant-sounding voices, were not attached to the three realms of existence, possessed undivided retinues of attendants, were arisen from omniscience, and possessed limitless meditative absorptions and meditative attainments. They all fulfilled every hope, experienced the perfection of discriminating wisdom, were inclined toward meaningful goals in their bodily, verbal, and mental deeds, were intent on omniscience, were blessed to have limitless meditative absorptions and conduct, had attained fearlessness, had emptiness as their sphere of experience, and dwelled in the absence of phenomenal marks. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-057-004-2573,folio:F.35.a}}}{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-057-004-71}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-057-004-72}}}{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-057-004-73}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-057-004-74}}}The bodhisattva great being Samanta­bhadra, who was seated as part of that assembly, bowing with his head to the feet of the Blessed One,  said, “Blessed One, how should we understand dharmadhātu?”
The Blessed One answered, “Son of a good family, dharmadhātu is to be understood as the absence of entities. Son of a good family, you should understand dharmadhātu as follows: as space-like, as without conceptual elaborations, as unelaborated, as without accepting, as without rejecting, as the absence of entities, and as foundationless.”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-057-004-76}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra asked, “Blessed One, does dharmadhātu arise?”
The Blessed One answered, “Son of a good family, dharmadhātu has no arising. Son of a good family, dharmadhātu is inconceivable. You should understand it as the absence of entities: entities are in no way expressible, nor can they be shown in any way.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-057-004-78}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra asked, “Blessed One, how many aspects does awakening have?” {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-057-004-2575,folio:F.35.b}}}
The Blessed One answered, “Son of a good family, the aspects of awakening are measureless; they cannot be shown to have a fixed measure.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-057-004-80}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra asked, “Blessed One, can dharmadhātu be conceptualized?”
The Blessed One answered, “Son of a good family, dharmadhātu is nonconceptual.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-057-004-82}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra asked, “If dharmadhātu is nonconceptual, how could it be that spiritually immature ordinary people would think of it?”
The Blessed One answered, “All spiritually immature ordinary people have arisen from thinking, conceptualizing, and imagining.”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-057-004-84}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Blessed One, the awakening of the tathāgatas  is profound.”
The Blessed One said, “So it is. As you say, son of a good family. Moreover, the fact that all phenomena are without conceptual elaborations is what is called awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-057-004-86}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta, who had already arrived at that assembly and was already seated, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and addressed him with these words: “I request that the Blessed One explain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch.”
The Blessed One answered, “Son of a good family, ask the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra. He possesses eloquent confidence that is unhindered with respect to all dharmas. He will teach it to you.”{{note:{index23,id:UT22084-057-004-88}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-057-004-89}}}Then Mañjuśrī seated himself directly facing the Blessed One with palms joined in supplication and said, “Why cannot the Blessed One himself, who is omniscient and all-seeing, explain it?”
The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, where there is a bodhisattva who possesses such excellent qualities, there the tathāgatas remain in indifference.” {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-057-004-2577,folio:F.36.a}}}
Mañjuśrī said, “Blessed One, tathāgatas do not remain in indifference.”
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-057-004-92}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, I am not abandoning the realm of sentient beings. Nevertheless, the teaching of the bodhisattvas is an immeasurable and inconceivable teaching.”
Then Mañjuśrī repeated, “I request the Blessed One to explain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch.”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-057-004-94}}}The Blessed One answered, “Son of a good family, ask the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra!  He will teach it to you. Why? Because that sublime man remains in the accumulation of gnosis.”
Mañjuśrī said, “If it is the Tathāgata’s intention that I do so, I will request it from that sublime man.”
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-057-004-96}}}The Blessed One said, “Mañjuśrī, if you have attained as many meditative absorptions as there are atoms, what need is there for you to request it from the Tathāgata? Son of a good family, you possess fortunate endowments regarding all the qualities of a buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-057-004-97}}}Mañjuśrī said, “Blessed One, all the qualities of a buddha that I have relied on, cultivated, and enhanced should be understood as the power of the person of the Tathāgata.”
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-057-004-98}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, excellent, excellent! You have spoken well. But I request you, Mañjuśrī, to ask the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra to teach.”
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-057-004-35}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta said to the Blessed One, “This bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra teaches the exceedingly profound. He has mastered the Mahāyāna.” {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-057-004-2579,folio:F.36.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-057-004-100}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, you, too, are a king whose might extends over all dharmas; do not address me. You also possess the inconceivable meditative absorption of abiding in emptiness.”{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-057-004-101}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-057-004-102}}}So Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta respectfully paid homage to the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra, pressing the ten fingers of his hands together and saying to him, “O son of the victors, if you grant me the occasion, I would like to ask you a few words.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-057-004-103}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said,  “Son of a good family, if you know the right time to have come, ask!”
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-057-004-34}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta asked the bodhisattva great being Samanta­bhadra, “O son of the victors, what is the basic meaning behind calling the Buddha ‘Buddha’?”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-057-004-105}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “O son of the victors, the basic meaning of buddha is groundlessness. The basic meaning of buddha is the absence of entities. The basic meaning of buddha is inconceivability. The basic meaning of buddha is to be equal to the unequaled. The basic meaning of buddha is the absence of conceptual elaborations. The basic meaning of buddha is unelaborated. The basic meaning of buddha is the absence of accepting. The basic meaning of buddha is the absence of rejecting. The basic meaning of buddha is space-like. The basic meaning of buddha is ineffability. Son of a good family, such is the nature of the qualities of a buddha.” {{note:{index25,id:UT22084-057-004-106}}}{{note:{index26,id:UT22084-057-004-107}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-057-004-108}}}Mañjuśrī said, “O son of the victors, but if all phenomena are without conceptual elaborations, how can you teach ‘qualities of a buddha’?”{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-057-004-109}}}
The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “O son of the victors, such a ‘teaching’ is unteachable.”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-057-004-111}}}Mañjuśrī said, “O son of the victors, if it is unteachable, what is taught?” 
The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Mañjuśrī, that which is the unteachable is taught through designation.” {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-057-004-2581,folio:F.37.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-057-004-113}}}Mañjuśrī said, “O son of the victors, what does one designate through designation?”
The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Mañjuśrī, through designation one designates neither entities nor the absence of entities.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-057-004-115}}}Mañjuśrī said, “O son of the victors, if one does not designate entities through designation and does not designate the absence of entities either, then how could the Three Vehicles  ever be taught?”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-057-004-116}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Mañjuśrī, do not be attached to the dharmadhātu, which is free of attachment! Why not? Mañjuśrī, it is because the Tathāgata taught that all phenomena are the absence of entities. Why are they the absence of entities? It is because the five aggregates are not apprehended.”{{note:{index28,id:UT22084-057-004-117}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-057-004-118}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Is awakening something with conceptual elaborations? Or is it something that is without conceptual elaborations?”
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-057-004-1263}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra replied, “Son of a good family, awakening is neither something with conceptual elaborations, nor is it something that is without conceptual elaborations. Thus, awakening exists neither in terms of having elaborations nor as being devoid of elaborations; it is indivisible into two.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-057-004-120}}}Then the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Samanta­bhadra, “Son of a good family, this inconceivable teaching is excellent, excellent! Yet, through the teaching of this discourse, the world with its gods will become confused.” {{note:{index29,id:UT22084-057-004-121}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-057-004-122}}}Mañjuśrī said, “Blessed One, to teach the Dharma in this way is not best suited to its being understood.”
The Blessed One replied, “Son of a good family, just as you say, it is not.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-057-004-124}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, are all phenomena designated by this type of designation?”
The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, just as you say, they are.” {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-057-004-2583,folio:F.37.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-057-004-126}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said to the Blessed One, “This pure access to the Dharma is difficult to appreciate!”{{note:{index30,id:UT22084-057-004-127}}}
The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, just as you say, it is.”
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-057-004-129}}}Then the bodhisattva Sāgara­mati said to the Blessed One:  “This pure access to the Dharma that was taught by the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra was well expressed.”
The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, just as you say, it was. Moreover, son of a good family, this is the natural result of all phenomena. It is a great rain of the Dharma.”{{note:{index31,id:UT22084-057-004-131}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-057-004-132}}}Then a brahmin who was like a great śāla tree and who dwelled in sameness said, “Blessed One, awakening is inconceivable sameness. No letters or words are perceived in it.”{{note:{index32,id:UT22084-057-004-133}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-057-004-1264}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, it is so; in the dharmadhātu no words are perceived, nor are any sense objects perceived.”
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-057-004-134}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what is the natural result of emptiness? What is its aspect? What is its sign? What is its phenomenal mark?”
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-057-004-136}}}The Blessed One said, “Mañjuśrī, emptiness is inexpressible and ineffable. That which partakes of its inexpressible nature is what is called emptiness. Emptiness is without letters, and thus it is called emptiness. Emptiness is ineffable, and hence it is called emptiness. Son of a good family, all phenomena are empty of their own essential nature.”
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-057-004-137}}}Then the venerable Śāradvatī­putra said to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, look at the magical displays of the bodhisattvas who dwell in the inconceivable reality.”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-057-004-1265}}}The Blessed One said:  “Venerable Śāradvatī­putra, the knowledge of a bodhisattva who has generated the thought of awakening for the first time is sublime, while the knowledge of an arhat is not like that. Why not? It is because the arhat remains far removed from the qualities of a buddha,  while the bodhisattva will become a blessed buddha.”{{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-057-004-2585,folio:F.38.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-057-004-139}}}The bodhisattva great being Sarva­dharmeśvara then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, according to my understanding of the sense of what the Blessed One has taught, the śrāvaka has simply not obtained the qualities of a śrāvaka.”
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-057-004-140}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, it is not that the śrāvaka has not obtained the qualities of a śrāvaka, but rather, how could śrāvakas answer questions together with bodhisattvas or have the power and potency to bring about a transformation of their conduct?”
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-057-004-141}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if the Tathāgata taught that this Śāradvatī­putra was foremost among disciples possessing discriminating wisdom, what did that teaching reveal?”
The Blessed One said, “Mañjuśrī, what I taught was without teaching.”
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-057-004-143}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta said to the elder Śāradvatī­putra, “Elder, did you obtain the qualities of a śrāvaka?” 
He answered, “No, I did not.”
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-057-004-145}}}Mañjuśrī said, “In that case, are you an ordinary person?”
“No.”
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-057-004-2566}}}“So, are you a trainee?”
“No.”
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-057-004-149}}}“Are you foremost among those who possess discriminating wisdom?”
“No.”
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-057-004-2567}}}Mañjuśrī said, “Honorable Śāradvatī­putra, if you are neither an ordinary person nor a trainee, nor foremost among those possessing discriminating wisdom, that can only mean you are someone who adheres to a heretical view.”{{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-057-004-2587,folio:F.38.b}}}{{note:{index33,id:UT22084-057-004-152}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-057-004-153}}}Śāradvatī­putra said, “Son of a good family, I am not going to debate with you, a sublime person whose profound depth is as unfathomable as the ocean.” 
Mañjuśrī said, “Honorable Śāradvatī­putra, do not say that! You are the most prominent of the older generation.”
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-057-004-155}}}The elder said, “The fact of my age will not itself achieve anything, nor will it lead to realization. To make it better understood, son of a good family, I will give you an analogy. Consider how with a small diamond even a great boulder may be destroyed. Likewise, the discriminating wisdom that you have in a single pore of your body is more than a sentient being like myself has in all the particles of my body put together. Son of a good family, to make it understood, I will use another analogy for you. It is like, for instance, how a powerful man can, with just a small iron hook, tame a huge frightful elephant. Son of good family, likewise, you possess power. I am weak. How can I debate with a great elephant like this?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-057-004-156}}}Then the elder Śāradvatī­putra said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, it is like this: if a blind man cannot follow after someone or see a city, how would he manage to go from house to house? That would be impossible. Similarly, I see myself as blind in the presence of great elephants like these. The qualities of a buddha are that vast. I am not a suitable vessel for the qualities of a buddha. Now there is nothing for me to do.”
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-057-004-157}}}The Blessed One said, “Śāradvatī­putra, do not talk like that! Consider, for example, that however many sentient beings may be touched by light from a tathāgata, all will obtain the qualities of a buddha. Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, you will be a recipient of limitless and inconceivable meditative absorptions.” {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-057-004-2590,folio:F.39.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-057-004-158}}}When the Blessed One explained this Dharma discourse, ninety-two thousand among the gods and humans gained a clear understanding of the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-057-004-1249}}}It was at this point that the bodhisattva Dharma­mati entered the bodhisattva’s meditative absorption called the infinite application of the jewel torch. No sooner had the bodhisattva Dharma­mati entered that meditative absorption than, from the world systems in each of the ten directions that exceed in number the atoms of ten thousand buddhafields, blessed buddhas numbering as many as the atoms of ten thousand buddhafields showed their faces. Those blessed buddhas all had but one and the very same name: Vajra Quintessence.{{note:{index34,id:UT22084-057-004-1527}}}{{note:{index35,id:UT22084-057-004-1284}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-057-004-160}}}As though they were in just one place despite issuing from the ten directions, those blessed buddhas said to him, “Dharma­mati, that you have entered the bodhisattva’s meditative absorption of the infinite application in this way is excellent, excellent! Son of a good family, it is like this. Through the previous aspirations and previous blessings of this blessed tathāgata Vairocana himself, and reinforced by your own roots of virtue, all we buddhas from the ten directions, numbering as many as the atoms of ten thousand buddhafields and each one with the same name, bless you, so that you may teach all Dharma teachings, purify the gnosis of buddhahood, increase the gnosis of buddhahood, enter into the dharmadhātu, liberate the realms of sentient beings, enter and penetrate unbound gnosis, engage with gnosis, speak all languages, enter into omniscient gnosis, become unobstructed with respect to all phenomena, and engage in teaching the Dharma through knowing all three times.  Through the strength and blessing of the Buddha, expound the Dharma with inspired speech, beginning with the ten categories of the bodhisattva!”{{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-057-004-2592,folio:F.39.b}}}{{note:{index36,id:UT22084-057-004-161}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-057-004-162}}}Then those blessed buddhas caused that blessed bodhisattva Dharma­mati to attain the light of unimpeded gnosis, with a very nature that was free of obstruction, free of interruption, and not forgetful; a gnosis free from differentiation, with a very nature that was morally blameless, inviolable, dauntless, inalienable; and excellent speech. Why so? Because he had thus obtained the very nature of that absorption.
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-057-004-163}}}Then those blessed buddhas extended their right hands and touched the head of the bodhisattva Dharma­mati. As soon as those blessed buddhas had touched the bodhisattva Dharma­mati, he rose from that absorption and said to the bodhisattvas, “O sons of the victors, this family of bodhisattvas is as follows: it is vast owing to the boundlessness of the dharmadhātu and of the element of space. O sons of the victors, the bodhisattva great beings were born into the family of past blessed buddhas, future blessed buddhas, and present blessed buddhas.”{{note:{index37,id:UT22084-057-004-164}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-057-004-165}}}Then those bodhisattvas said to the bodhisattva Dharma­mati, “O son of the victors, who are those bodhisattva great beings who were born into the family of the past, future, and present  blessed buddhas? Tell me what thought they came from.

{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-057-004-167}}}The bodhisattva Dharma­mati said to those bodhisattvas, “O sons of the victors, ten categories of bodhisattvas were taught, are taught, and will be taught by buddhas of the past, present, and future. What are those ten? They are: (1) bodhisattvas who have generated the initial thought of awakening, (2) beginners, (3) those who engage in yogic practice, (4) those who have taken rebirth, (5) those who have perfected application, (6) those who have perfected intention, (7) those who are irreversible, (8) those who are still youths, (9) those who are regents, and (10) those who have been consecrated. O sons of the victors, those ten categories of bodhisattvas were taught, are taught, and will be taught by buddhas of the past, present, and future.{{note:{index39,id:UT22084-057-004-168}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-057-004-169}}}(1) “O sons of the victors, what is the category of bodhisattvas who have generated the initial thought of awakening? O sons of the victors, these bodhisattvas who have generated the initial thought of awakening will, as soon as they see the blessed buddhas, see an excellent or beautiful form with a completely excellent and brilliant complexion, miracles of magical displays, miracles of mind reading, or miracles of insightful admonition, or see suffering sentient beings, or hear the praises of the Tathāgata, such that they will long for all-knowing gnosis and from the very beginning generate the intention to attain the highest insuperable awakening. And as soon as that very first intention to attain awakening is generated, those beings will have taken up ten things that are difficult to approach. What are those ten?

{{milestone:{label:1.185,id:UT22084-057-004-327}}}Having heard the Tathāgata’s decree, the venerable Śāradvatī­putra, thirsting to hear the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch, told Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world, “Gather all the Dharma listeners. Gather them because the Tathāgata is going to explain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch and teach the inconceivable. Later you will certainly regret missing it. Hey friends, it is extremely rare for precious sūtras like this to appear in the world!” {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-057-004-2641,folio:F.51.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.186,id:UT22084-057-004-328}}}Then, at that very instant, Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world gathered and circumambulated the Blessed One three times. Taking their seats in the presence of the Blessed One, they humbly folded their hands and supplicated the Blessed One:  “We ask that the Blessed One kindly explain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch!” Then, by remaining silent, the Blessed One assented.{{note:{index82,id:UT22084-057-004-329}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.191,id:UT22084-057-004-334}}}At that time, Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta was staying seated with a motionless body near the foot of some palāśa and sāla trees. He sat facing forward in a pavilion surrounded by the gods Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world, with a form and complexion more radiant than countless millions of suns. His body had a golden color, and he sat there illumined, bright, and resplendent. {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-057-004-2643,folio:F.52.a}}}

To this Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta answered,  “Honorable Śāradvatī­putra, what is the basic meaning of ‘tathāgata’?”
{{milestone:{label:1.193,id:UT22084-057-004-338}}}Śāradvatī­putra said, “Son of a good family, you have profound discriminating wisdom; I cannot debate with you.”
“Do not worry! I will teach according to what you can tolerate,” replied Mañjuśrī.
Śāradvatī­putra said, “Son of a good family, I will listen. You explain!”

At that time, all the resident deities from the class of pure abodes down to the Akaniṣṭhā class gathered. Along with the four great kings and their troops and servants, several tens of millions of yakṣa deities assembled. Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world gathered.

{{milestone:{label:1.196,id:UT22084-057-004-343}}}Then the venerable Śāradvatī­putra circumambulated the Blessed One three times and said, “Blessed One, through whose power has this assembly gathered here and now? How are we to understand it?”
The Blessed One answered, “Venerable Śāradvatī­putra, it is the power of the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch.”
{{milestone:{label:1.197,id:UT22084-057-004-345}}}Śāradvatī­putra declared, “Blessed One, I would like to learn the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch.”

{{milestone:{label:1.200,id:UT22084-057-004-350}}}Then Mañjuśrī asked the elder Śāradvatī­putra, “Elder Śāradvatī­putra, among those who listen to the Dharma who have arisen solely through illusion, to whom will I explain the Dharma? Who is it that listens? Who is it that explains?”
The elder answered, “Noble one, you explain! I will listen.”
{{milestone:{label:1.201,id:UT22084-057-004-352}}}Mañjuśrī said, “Honorable Śāradvatī­putra, what is ‘explaining’ an epithet for?”

“Mañjuśrī, ‘emptiness’ is the absence of words.”
{{milestone:{label:1.203,id:UT22084-057-004-356}}}Mañjuśrī said, “Honorable Śāradvatī­putra, if emptiness is without words, how can we explain it? Honorable Śāradvatī­putra, all phenomena are impossible to teach. Śāradvatī­putra, they are unteachable and impossible to learn.”{{note:{index84,id:UT22084-057-004-357}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.204,id:UT22084-057-004-358}}}The elder said, “Son of a good family, all of those things that you thus have taught are explained as being emptiness. They are explained as being without phenomenal marks, wishless, without acceptance, without rejection, without conceptual elaborations, and unelaborated.”
{{milestone:{label:1.205,id:UT22084-057-004-359}}}Then the fully endowed assembly of bodhisattvas, as well as Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world, were very pleased. They declared unanimously that Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta and the venerable Śāradvatī­putra’s teaching of the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch was well explained and excellent.
{{milestone:{label:1.206,id:UT22084-057-004-360}}}Then the venerable Subhūti said to Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta: “Mañjuśrī, how should a bodhisattva memorize, recite, study, or explain to others in great detail the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch?”
{{milestone:{label:1.207,id:UT22084-057-004-361}}}Mañjuśrī said:  “Subhūti, this dhāraṇī should be thought of as birthless.

{{milestone:{label:1.209,id:UT22084-057-004-363}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra rose from his seat and, covering one shoulder with his robe, addressed the Blessed One: “Blessed One, what sort of thing is the great compassion that the bodhisattva great beings have?”
{{milestone:{label:1.210,id:UT22084-057-004-364}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, regarding the great compassion of the bodhisattva great beings, to not at all abandon the three realms is great compassion. To thoroughly display the buddhafields to all sentient beings is great compassion. To receive into one’s care any sentient beings who are lax in their discipline is great compassion. To not abandon the perfection of wisdom is great compassion. To sacrifice one’s body and life for the sake of all sentient beings is great compassion. To express loving kindness to sentient beings who are engaged in desire is great compassion. To have loving kindness for powerful sentient beings is the great compassion of the bodhisattva great beings. Son of a good family, moreover, bodhisattva great beings should keep their minds free from animosity. They should practice being unassociated many times over.”
{{milestone:{label:1.211,id:UT22084-057-004-365}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said to the Blessed One, “For the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, with kindness toward the world,  for the majority of beings, and for the purpose and benefit of gods and humans and for their happiness, would the Blessed One kindly explain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch?

{{milestone:{label:1.219,id:UT22084-057-004-377}}}Then the Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, the basic meaning of all dharmas is the meaning of having no basis. The basic meaning of all dharmas is the basic meaning of the absence of entities. The basic meaning of all dharmas is the basic meaning of space. The basic meaning of all dharmas is the basic meaning of not accepting. The basic meaning of all dharmas is the basic meaning of not rejecting.”
{{milestone:{label:1.220,id:UT22084-057-004-378}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Blessed One, in that case, why did you speak of ‘all dharmas’?”
The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, when I mentioned ‘all dharmas,’ I meant the senses of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, and similarly the elements of perception, the cognitive faculties, and dependent origination. That is what I meant when I mentioned ‘all dharmas.’ Son of a good family, moreover, all dharmas, since they are from the beginning unborn, are empty.”
{{milestone:{label:1.221,id:UT22084-057-004-380}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta said to the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra, “O son of the victors, how should the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch be retained?”
The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra answered,  “This dhāraṇī should be retained as a teaching on reality, the reality of the unborn, the reality of non-arising, the reality of being without defining marks, the reality of space, the reality of the absence of entities, the reality of the essential nature, and the reality of the essential nature of the absence of entities. Son of a good family, the retention, the complete retention, the cultivation through meditation, the investigation, the designation,  the positing, the liberation, the differentiation, and the clarification of the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch should be like this. Son of a good family, that is the sense of cultivating and investigating the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch.”{{page:{number:44,id:UT22084-057-004-2658,folio:F.55.b}}}

Son of a good family, it is like all the dogs and cats of the world, or all of its foxes, being unable to pick apart and comprehend the great central mountain, Sumeru. Similarly, son of a good family, if none of the śrāvakas who are like this Śāradvatī­putra can understand even a single basic principle of the bodhisattva doctrine, it goes without saying that will be unable to fathom what Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta has taught.” {{page:{number:45,id:UT22084-057-004-2660,folio:F.56.a}}}

They will attain the awakening of a buddha. They will draw closer to the Buddha’s teaching. Māra and the divine sons belonging to the family of māras who search for an opening to attack them will not find one. Son of a good family, people who produce an unfriendly attitude toward such Dharma-teaching monks for even the duration of a single snap of the fingers  will distance themselves from attaining even human rebirth, so it goes without saying that they will be far removed from attaining the awakening of a buddha. Moreover, Mañjuśrī, people who have no faith in the monks who maintain this king of sūtras will have ugly, crooked teeth and will be without tongues or noses; their feet and hands will point outward, their bodily diseases will become worm-infested, they will lose their eyes, and they will possess faulty intelligence and poor diligence. Mañjuśrī, such are the problems experienced by such ignorant people. In brief, Mañjuśrī, at the time of death such people will experience, in every pore of their bodies, the infinite sufferings of the hells. And even if they gain human rebirths, they will be constantly blind and without tongues.  Mañjuśrī, those who abandon this Dharma instruction in this very life will suffer from leprosy. Their lips will become terrifying. Their bodies will become ravaged, naked, and thin; they will look like hungry ghosts.

Owing to their rejecting of Dharma, they will be reborn in unbearable flaming hell realms immediately after death. As soon as they are born there, the heads of those ignorant ones will be cut off by an iron wheel, and in that way many eons will pass. For many thousands of eons they will be born blind, and even when they are born as humans, after the passage of hundreds of eons they will have always been born blind. They will have no tongues, with faces facing backwards, with backs like tents, centers that are are recessed, and lame feet, with voices like dogs and with bodies emaciated through constant hunger and thirst, and with faces always looking skyward.

Friends, if I, who have attained omniscient gnosis, am frightened, it is natural for my students to be. Sons and daughters of good families, the teachings are profound. If no human or demon, no god, nāga, yakṣa, or gandharva can endure this disruption, it goes without saying that no human ascetic or brahmin can. Sons of good families, this Dharma discourse is a sacred stūpa for the world, including the gods. Sons of good families, you should view this king among sūtras as like, for instance, the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra.”{{note:{index97,id:UT22084-057-004-415}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.241,id:UT22084-057-004-416}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta said, “Blessed One, this was well taught. Blessed One, how will such monks be able to comprehend gifts given in faith?” {{page:{number:49,id:UT22084-057-004-2668,folio:F.58.a}}}
The Blessed One said, “Mañjuśrī, those who abandon this Dharma discourse and who view its teachers with an unfriendly attitude—I do not allow them to use things given in faith for a day or for a finger snap, or to come as far as one can spit to land that was donated to the monastic assembly.”{{note:{index98,id:UT22084-057-004-418}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.242,id:UT22084-057-004-419}}}Then the venerable Śāradvatī­putra asked, “Is this deed almost as bad as their committing the five heinous sins of immediate hell consequence? Or is it far better than that?”
{{milestone:{label:1.243,id:UT22084-057-004-420}}}The Blessed One said:  “Elder Śāradvatī­putra, do not ask with a hushed voice! Why not? Because the five heinous sins of immediate hell consequence would be better to commit, whereas to abandon this Dharma discourse is something altogether different. Śāradvatī­putra, the karmic consequences of the five heinous sins of immediate hell consequence would be quickly exhausted, and one could quickly become a human again. But people who abandon the holy Dharma will never achieve the qualities of a buddha; they bring disaster to both themselves and others.”
{{milestone:{label:1.244,id:UT22084-057-004-421}}}Then the venerable Śāradvatī­putra broke into tears in the presence of the Blessed One, saying, “How sad! Those who abandon the Dharma experience such suffering! May I never see such karmic obscurations, even in a dream!”
{{milestone:{label:1.245,id:UT22084-057-004-422}}}The Blessed One said to venerable Śāradvatī­putra: “Śāradvatī­putra, do not think like that! If my doctrine is associated with ordinary reality, then in the world one commits one’s own karma, experiences one’s personal share of karmic retribution, and reinforces one’s own karma. Thus, sentient beings experience suffering according to their own karmic deeds; that is not the Tathāgata’s fault. Śāradvatī­putra, I have explained the path leading to excellent virtue.  I explained the path leading to happiness, fearlessness, nirvāṇa, and immortality. Nevertheless, these sentient beings who commit bodily, verbal, and mental misdeeds defame the āryas and harbor wrong views. Through their wrong views and because of abandoning the Dharma, when they die they will be reborn in the hells, and for that the Tathāgata is not to blame. {{page:{number:50,id:UT22084-057-004-2670,folio:F.58.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.246,id:UT22084-057-004-423}}}“Śāradvatī­putra, my compassion for all sentient beings arises like this. For the sake of one sentient being, I have the thought to not abandon one who experiences the sufferings of hell for either an eon or longer than an eon; such is the great compassion of the Tathāgata. 
{{milestone:{label:1.247,id:UT22084-057-004-424}}}“Śāradvatī­putra, it is like this: suppose, for example, that some person had an only son who was of sound body, was handsome, attractive, of good complexion, and had reached the full growth of young adulthood. But owing to certain circumstances, that son died. That person, thinking of his son, would suffer and feel unhappy, crying and wailing. Śāradvatī­putra, a tathāgata, arhat, and fully awakened buddha also thinks of suffering sentient beings as his only son. But the tathāgatas do not stay together with the emotional defilements. Śāradvatī­putra, just as, for example, the great ocean will not remain together with a corpse without casting it up on the shore, the tathāgatas do not stay together with the emotional defilements. Or it is like, for example, a magician or one of his skilled apprentices who magically projects a great gathering of people at the junction of four roads.  Though the conjurer displays those people performing actions, in fact those activities do not reside either in that location or in that position. Being unborn, those actions are neither obstructed nor do they come to an end. Śāradvatī­putra, just so, the tathāgatas bring sentient beings to maturity and demonstrate aspirational conduct, but though they reveal such conduct it does not exist. For instance, the element of space is without conceptual thought and without elaborations. Nevertheless, the tathāgatas act in conformity with sentient beings. Similarly, the body of a tathāgata is without conceptual thought  and without elaborations. Nevertheless, the tathāgatas act in conformity with the way that is most conducive to the training of sentient beings.{{page:{number:51,id:UT22084-057-004-2672,folio:F.59.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.248,id:UT22084-057-004-425}}}“Śāradvatī­putra, the Tathāgata does not have delusion, nor does he harbor unknowing or forgetting. Śāradvatī­putra, I am the elder brother of the world, and together with its gods I am the chief, the superior, the best, the preeminent, the revered, the unsurpassed, the one without a superior, and the one equal to the unequaled. Śāradvatī­putra, this statement of mine corresponds to the truth. Whether they are monks or laymen, all those beings who reject this Dharma discourse will experience the sufferings of hell in this way.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.249,id:UT22084-057-004-426}}}Then the venerable Subhūti, after hearing what the Blessed One had taught, said, “Blessed One, what those sentient beings gain, they gain as a crime. What will the tongues of those who abandon this Dharma discourse be like?”
{{milestone:{label:1.250,id:UT22084-057-004-427}}}The Blessed One said, “Subhūti, their tongues will grow a hundred thousand yojanas long, and they will be plowed by a flaming iron plow that burns hotter and hotter, flaming higher and higher and more and more intensely, bursting into five hundred million individual tongues of flame.  Why so? Because they did not guard their speech. Subhūti, those ignorant ones will be subject to karmic obscurations like that.”{{page:{number:52,id:UT22084-057-004-2674,folio:F.59.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.251,id:UT22084-057-004-1569}}}Then by the power of the Buddha, the entire assembly of disciples uttered the solemn utterance: “What the Tathāgata has taught is a great marvel!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.252,id:UT22084-057-004-429}}}Then Indra, king of gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will carry in homage on my shoulders those monks who teach this Dharma. I will worship them with flowers, incense, fragrance, garlands, and unguent oils. I will bow after offering parasols three times by day and three times by night. I will venerate, I will pay homage, I will adore as my guru, I will pay respect, I will worship, I will venerate, and I will honor them. I will pay them homage, honor them as guru, and respectfully protect them. Why so? Because they are the sons of the Blessed One and have left everything behind on the basis of the dharmakāya. Blessed One, it is like, for example, the son of a king of the royal lineage who has been anointed prince and successor, who has a fine body and who is good looking and handsome. He is worthy of the respect of all his underlings and worthy of their honor. Similarly, those teachers of this Dharma teaching are worthy of the respect and honor of the world, together with its gods.”
{{milestone:{label:1.253,id:UT22084-057-004-430}}}Then the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra, “Son of a good family, Indra spoke well when he said he would keep those monks safe from worries and protect and watch over them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.254,id:UT22084-057-004-431}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Blessed One, I, too, will watch over those sons or daughters of good families.  I will protect them, favor them, and make them attain peace and excellent happiness. Within an area a hundred yojanas in circumference, I will watch over them.”{{page:{number:53,id:UT22084-057-004-2676,folio:F.60.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.255,id:UT22084-057-004-432}}}Then the Blessed One said to Samanta­bhadra, “Son of a good family, your well-spoken words are excellent, excellent!”  Then the Blessed One spoke this verse with the beautiful voice of Brahmā:
{{milestone:{label:1.256,id:UT22084-057-004-433}}}“Accumulating benefits for others and causing them happiness,
Endowed with excellent supreme words that are utterly beautiful, 
You, with an immaculate face, expressed well 
Your highest thoughts—incomparable jewels of excellent qualities.”
{{milestone:{label:1.257,id:UT22084-057-004-434}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra asked the Blessed One, “What are the qualities that those bodhisattva great beings must possess for them to obtain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch?”
{{milestone:{label:1.258,id:UT22084-057-004-435}}}The Blessed One said, “Son of a good family, those bodhisattva great beings will obtain the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch if they possess one quality. What is it? It is not having anger toward any sentient beings. Also, Samanta­bhadra, those bodhisattva great beings should have two more qualities. What are they? They are to have neither jealousy nor pride. Those are the qualities of the bodhisattva great beings. Moreover, Samanta­bhadra, those bodhisattva great beings should not harm the faculties of any sentient beings. Samanta­bhadra, furthermore, in all ways and in all respects, a bodhisattva should not cause harm to any sentient beings.”
{{milestone:{label:1.259,id:UT22084-057-004-436}}}When the qualities of bodhisattvas were explained and the special virtues of the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch were taught in detail,  infinite numbers of human beings attained the non-forgetting retention of the dhāraṇī.{{page:{number:54,id:UT22084-057-004-2678,folio:F.60.b}}}

{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-057-004-438}}}Then the venerable Ānanda arose from his seat and, covering one shoulder with his robe, knelt on one knee. Bowing with folded hands toward the seat of the Blessed One, he said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, this Dharma discourse is profound.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-057-004-439}}}The Blessed One said, “Ānanda, so it is. Because the aggregate of form is profound, it is profound. Because the aggregates of feeling, perception, mental forces, and cognition are profound, it is profound. Because emptiness is profound, it is profound. Because the element of space is profound, it is profound.”
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-057-004-440}}}Ānanda said, “Though I have heard eighty-four thousand articles of Dharma from the Tathāgata, I never heard one like the present Dharma discourse.”
The Blessed One said, “This Dharma discourse is extremely difficult to receive.”
{{milestone:{label:2.4,id:UT22084-057-004-442}}}Ānanda said, “Blessed One, I beg you to magically bless this Dharma discourse so that in a later time and later period, during the last five hundred years when the noble Dharma is coming to an end, it will perform Buddha activities for many sentient beings.”
{{milestone:{label:2.5,id:UT22084-057-004-443}}}The Blessed One said, “Ānanda, I have already blessed this Dharma discourse. I, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni, have also blessed those Dharma teachers who will teach it. Ānanda, those who write this Dharma discourse will not suffer eye disease. Their tongues, noses, teeth, hands, and feet will not become diseased. Their brains will not be diseased, nor will their ears. Their bodies will not deteriorate, nor will they smell bad. They will not be killed by harmful enemies.  They will be protected by all humans and non-human deities,  and when they do die they will, avoiding other entanglements, be born in the happy realms among the gods.”{{page:{number:55,id:UT22084-057-004-2680,folio:F.61.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.6,id:UT22084-057-004-444}}}Ānanda said, “Blessed One, why did Māra not cause obstacles when you explained this Dharma? Owing to what conditions did that not occur?”
The Blessed One answered, “Ānanda, all māras were unable to create an obstacle to this Dharma discourse. Ānanda, when Māra the evil one conceived the intention to obstruct the teaching of the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch, he saw his own home burning in flames; Ānanda, this Dharma discourse is so profound. Ānanda, any place where this Dharma discourse has been practiced becomes a holy stūpa shrine worthy of respect.”
{{milestone:{label:2.7,id:UT22084-057-004-446}}}Ānanda said, “If in that very place where the Tathāgata dwells this Dharma discourse also exists, how great would my error be if I went to see the Tathāgata and, after going there, I first bowed to that Tathāgata and later to this Dharma discourse?”
{{milestone:{label:2.8,id:UT22084-057-004-447}}}The Blessed One said, “Ānanda, if you set this Dharma discourse to one side and bowed to me, that would be a fault. Ānanda, moreover, though I am the elder brother of the world with its gods, the chief, the best, and the superior, Ānanda, I attained the perfect awakening of buddhahood after I heard this Dharma discourse.”
{{milestone:{label:2.9,id:UT22084-057-004-448}}}Ānanda said, “Blessed One, from which tathāgata did you hear the teaching of the precious absorption of the dhāraṇī of the jewel torch? Who was higher than the Tathāgata?” {{page:{number:56,id:UT22084-057-004-2683,folio:F.61.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.10,id:UT22084-057-004-449}}}The Blessed One said, “Ānanda, no one is higher than me in the worlds of men, gods, and gandharvas. Yet when I was practicing the conduct of a bodhisattva, I learned from the blessed one, the tathāgata Layered Essence of Endless Gnosis, out of a vast matrix of many light rays radiating from wonderful inconceivable lights. Ānanda, after experiencing thousands and millions of ascetic hardships, I heard this Dharma discourse. At that time, that tathāgata made a prophecy about me. Therefore, Ānanda, first bow to this Dharma discourse and later pay homage to me.”
{{milestone:{label:2.11,id:UT22084-057-004-450}}}Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world then spoke unanimously: “How wonderful is the Dharma! How wonderful is the Dharma! How wonderful are the magical powers of the Dharma teachings! If sentient beings who so much as hear the name of this Dharma discourse should be honored, it goes without saying that those who memorize, read, study, and teach it in detail to others should be honored all the more. They should be called tathāgatas.”
The Blessed One replied to Indra, Brahmā, and the guardian deities of the world, “Friends, your words are well spoken. Excellent, excellent!”
{{milestone:{label:2.12,id:UT22084-057-004-452}}}The Blessed One now used the miraculous faculty of his tongue and, making his voice heard throughout the realm of the whole billionfold world system, said to the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra, “Those sentient beings who do not listen to this Dharma discourse are like blind people who do not see the light of the sun, like people who do not know how a transaction is made,  and like poor people who look to others for support.  In order to ensure that sentient beings do not become far removed from such a mass of precious teachings in the way I have illustrated with these similes, would it please you, son of a good family, if I were to make a request of you for the sake of this Dharma discourse and for the benefit of sentient beings?”{{page:{number:57,id:UT22084-057-004-2685,folio:F.62.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.13,id:UT22084-057-004-454}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra rose from his seat and covered one shoulder with his robe. Bowing with folded hands toward the Blessed One, he wept.
As soon as the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra rose from his Dharma mat, the entire billionfold world system shook in six ways, it shook strongly and shook violently; it quaked, quaked strongly, and quaked violently; it trembled, trembled strongly, and trembled violently; it was disturbed, strongly disturbed, and violently disturbed; it shuddered, shuddered strongly, and shuddered violently; and it was agitated, strongly agitated, and violently agitated. And in the world a great light shone. 
{{milestone:{label:2.14,id:UT22084-057-004-455}}}Then the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra pressed the fingers of his hands together in homage and wept. He said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I would be delighted. Sugata, I would be delighted. Blessed One, you are all-knowing, you intend the benefit of all sentient beings, and you are endowed with great compassion. Yet on top of that, as I am born from the Tathāgata, why would I not act in accord with the Tathāgata’s word? If the word of the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, is a word of ambrosia, how could I be capable of acting in contradiction to the Tathāgata’s word? Blessed One, I will keep what you say in mind, I will not fail to keep it in mind.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.15,id:UT22084-057-004-456}}}Then the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra, “O son of the victors, excellent, excellent!  You are the elder son of the tathāgatas; the chief, the best, the superior, and the preeminent one. I have entrusted you with this Dharma discourse. This is my teacher. Therefore, you should guard it. From time to time, show it respect. Place it in a precious container and carry it on your shoulder. In later times and periods, pay no heed to those sinful monks. Son of a good family, these are my instructions to you.”{{page:{number:58,id:UT22084-057-004-2687,folio:F.62.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.16,id:UT22084-057-004-457}}}The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “Blessed One, what sort of people who have gone forth will there be?”
The Blessed One said, “Do not ask in a whisper.”
The bodhisattva Samanta­bhadra said, “If it would benefit many sentient beings, I beg the Blessed One to kindly give us an explanation. I beg the Sugata to please give an explanation.”
{{milestone:{label:2.17,id:UT22084-057-004-460}}}The Blessed One said, “Samanta­bhadra, I will explain, so listen! Everyone in this great ocean-like assembly and all of these countless bodhisattva great beings such as Mañjuśrī and Avaloki­teśvara should leave off other thoughts and should heed what sort of people who have gone forth there will be in a later time and period.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.18,id:UT22084-057-004-461}}}Then the Blessed One said to Samanta­bhadra, “Samanta­bhadra, people who have gone forth will vex the holy Dharma, will be attached to homes, attached to material gain, attached to temples, attached to dwellings, and attached to their begging bowls and robes; they will bother homes, and will engage in all sinful doctrines.  Samanta­bhadra, for me to entrust this sūtra for the sake of those ignorant ones would indeed bring this sūtra to its decline.”
{{milestone:{label:2.19,id:UT22084-057-004-462}}}Then from all directions came gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas. They said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, we, too, have all assembled and gathered. As long as we live and for as long as the holy Dharma endures, we will protect this Dharma discourse.  We will also guard those future Dharma-teaching monks who will maintain it.

Is the merit of upholding this chapter of Dharma.’

All realms in all ten directions shook.
All māra realms were outshone,
And with a great sound ringing out, the lower realms became calm.
{{milestone:{label:2.395,id:UT22084-057-004-864}}}“All the lords of humans in all ten directions
Showed their faces 
And extending their hands, laid them
Atop the head of Bhadraśrī, who possessed infinite qualities.

All those buddhas said:
‘Your excellent exposition of these emancipations is good.
I rejoice in your excellent expression!’ ”{{page:{number:96,id:UT22084-057-004-2765,folio:F.81.b}}}{{note:{index141,id:UT22084-057-004-1531}}}

All the gods in the realm of this world and the humans and non-human demigods said, “The Tathāgata has taught this so well! O, the Tathāgata has turned a second wheel of Dharma! We have never heard this Dharma teaching before. Very few sentient beings will obtain this Dharma discourse. Those sentient beings will not have miserable roots of merit. Those sentient beings have paid respectful service to many buddhas. Those sentient beings will be like sacred stūpas in this world including its gods, its māras, and Brahmā.  They will be invulnerable to harm by Māra, by other gods of the māra class, or by monks or by laymen, and likewise not by kings, by ministers, or by householders.”
At this, a clamor and laughter were heard.

Nevertheless, through the power of the Tathāgata such a Dharma has appeared in the world, and solely through the power of the Tathāgata, those sentient beings also heard it.”

Then the venerable Ānanda, after circumambulating the Blessed One three times, said, “I will retain this Dharma discourse. I shall see that it is not forgotten.” {{page:{number:97,id:UT22084-057-004-2767,folio:F.82.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.400,id:UT22084-057-004-872}}}Then, after the Blessed One had spoken, that full assembly of bodhisattvas, the bodhisattvas Samanta­bhadra and Mañjuśrī Kumāra­bhūta, and the elder Śāradvatī­putra, the other great śrāvakas, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas all rejoiced, and they praised what the Blessed One had said.
