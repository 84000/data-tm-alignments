The Questions of the Nāga King Anavatapta
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-058-005-93}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-058-005-863,folio:F.206.a}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha with a great saṅgha of one thousand two hundred fifty monks and many bodhisattva great beings. At that time, while the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma to an audience of many hundreds of thousands, the nāga king Anavatapta, escorted by a retinue of six million eight hundred thousand nāga kings and eighty-four thousand nāga maidens playing instruments and singing songs, approached the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-058-005-97}}}Through their great powers and miraculous abilities, those nāgas arrived bearing flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, powders, garments, parasols, banners, and flags. When they came before the Blessed One, they bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet, circumambulated the Blessed One three times, and offered the Blessed One all the flowers, perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, powders, garments, parasols, banners, flags, instruments, and drums that they had brought. Then, with respect and with reverence, the nāga king and his retinue of beings sat to one side. Once seated, the nāga king addressed the Blessed One with his palms joined together: “Were the Blessed One to grant me some time for instruction concerning my inquiries, there are some topics on which I would like to question the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha.” {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-058-005-864,folio:F.206.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-058-005-98}}}Although he already knew the answer, the Blessed One asked the nāga king Anavatapta, “Lord of nāgas, what is it that you would like to ask the Thus-Gone One for the sake of beings?”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-058-005-99}}}“Blessed One, I would like to question the Thus-Gone One on behalf of bodhisattvas, the supreme beings, the great beings, the holy ones who play like lions—on behalf, Blessed One, of the guides of the world who are untainted by worldly concerns; whose conduct and thoughts are pure; who bring genuine benefit to others; who act as spiritual friends to all beings without needing to be asked; who have the might of the ten powers; who defeat the arguments of those who attend misguided assemblies; who have overcome Māra and other opponents; who are undaunted; who have donned the armor of steadfast diligence; who are tireless of mind; who have accumulated immeasurable roots of virtue; whose appetite for discipline and learning cannot be satisfied; who treat all beings equally; who are devoid of the perception of difference; who are free from both extreme views; who are expert in understanding the processes of dependent origination; who engage with the profundity of the Buddha’s teachings that are deep and difficult to fathom; who are without the mental engagement of hearers and solitary buddhas; who have not forgotten the mind of omniscience;{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-058-005-100}}} whose intention is as firm and unbreakable as a diamond; whose intelligence is as bright and unblemished as the moon; whose minds are like the expanse of space; who for countless eons have been indefatigable of mind; whose hearts are equal to earth, water, fire, and wind; who have eliminated malice, obstinacy, hatred, pride, arrogance, and conceit; who aspire to emptiness, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-058-005-865,folio:F.207.a}}} signlessness, and wishlessness; who have comprehended that phenomena are like illusions, dreams, hallucinations, echoes, mirages, and reflections of the moon in water; who hold the lineage of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha; who are as rare as udumbara flowers; who delight in turning the wheel of the Dharma; who have obtained supreme joy and serenity; who are single-pointed in concentration with unwavering focus; who are endowed with all supreme attributes. It is on behalf of such beings that I would like to question the Thus Gone One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-058-005-101}}}“Blessed One, it is for the sake of bodhisattva great beings whose noble qualities surpass even these, and for the sake of all beings, that I make these inquiries of the Thus Gone One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-058-005-102}}}“Blessed One, for bodhisattva great beings, please explain the play of phenomena, entering vajra-like qualities, and entering profound practice and the arrangement of dhāraṇī gateways. So as to train hearers, please explain entering the gateway of knowledge through sure engagement with the four truths of the noble ones. So as to train solitary buddhas, please explain entering the gateway of knowledge through engagement with teachings on dependence. So as to train those of the Great Vehicle, please explain entering the gateway of knowledge through engagement with all phenomena. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-058-005-103}}}“Blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, for the benefit of bodhisattvas, please tell us about the annihilation of the hordes of Māra, the destruction of all wrong views, the elimination of all afflictions, the knowledge of all beings’ actions, the engagement of correct understandings, the thorough explanation of all teachings, and the way beings are liberated in accordance with their inclinations. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-058-005-104}}}“Blessed One, how are bodhisattvas endowed with the power of wisdom through conquering pride, arrogance, and conceit? {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-058-005-866,folio:F.207.b}}} How are they endowed with the power of Dharma through reliance on the ripening of karma? How are they endowed with the power of generosity through not being miserly with material goods or with the gift of the Dharma? How are they ready to give up everything without expecting reward? How are they endowed with the power of discipline through behaving correctly in accordance with their aspirations and cutting off all entrances to the lower realms? How are they endowed with the power of patience through having the nature of being able to accept all the hostility of beings? How are they endowed with the power of diligence through having no regard for their own lives and limbs? How are they endowed with the power of concentration by abiding in tranquility and knowing how to emerge out of concentration? How are they endowed with the power of insight by being devoid of negative views and the darkness of ignorance and delusion? How are they endowed with the power of skillful means by ripening beings and seeking the armor by which they ripen them? How have they obtained the higher perceptions by reveling in the divine eye, the divine ear, the knowledge of the thoughts of others, the knowledge of previous births, and miraculous powers? How are they endowed with the power of eloquence by means of uninterrupted eloquence with inexhaustible words and syllables? How do they attain the power of retention that retains all that has been heard? How do they attain the absorption called the ocean seal and maintain unfaltering focus on the unique precious jewel of Dharma? How do they maintain the unfaltering mindfulness of the Buddha that stays focused on the pure view of the Buddha? How do they achieve the mindfulness of the Dharma that stays focused on the pure view of the Dharma? How do they achieve the mindfulness of the Saṅgha that stays focused on the saṅgha of those who have reached irreversibility? How do they achieve the mindfulness of discipline in which the mind of awakening does not falter? {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-058-005-867,folio:F.208.a}}} How do they achieve the mindfulness of generosity that is not miserly with regard to material things and the gift of the Dharma? How do they maintain the unfaltering mindfulness of the gods that recollects those bodhisattvas in the Heaven of Joy who are bound by just one last birth?”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-058-005-105}}}Having asked these questions of the Blessed One, the nāga king Anavatapta spoke the following verses:

{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-058-005-116}}}The Blessed One replied to the nāga king Anavatapta, “Excellent, lord of nāgas! Excellent! That you have thought to ask the Thus-Gone One these questions is in keeping, lord of the nāgas, with your previous roots of virtue. You have not given up great compassion, you act as a spiritual friend to all beings without being asked, you are not disheartened in saṃsāra, and you perpetuate the lineage of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha—excellent! Therefore, lord of nāgas, listen carefully, and pay attention; I shall tell you how bodhisattvas attain these and other distinguished qualities.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-058-005-117}}}“I will, Blessed One,” replied the nāga king Anavatapta, and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-058-005-118}}}“Lord of nāgas,” said the Blessed One, “if bodhisattva great beings have just one quality, they will have all the qualities of a buddha with every supreme attribute. What is that single quality? It is the mind of omniscience that does not overlook any being. This mind of omniscience involves thirty-two aspects. What are the thirty-two aspects? It involves intention, it involves resolve, it involves great love, it involves great compassion, it involves tirelessness, it involves strength, it involves overcoming, it involves power, it involves discernment, it involves giving spiritual guidance, it involves Dharma practice, it involves virtuous behavior, it involves the means of attraction, it involves restraint, it involves skillful means, it involves nonfabrication, it involves following through on one’s words, {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-058-005-869,folio:F.209.a}}} it involves not hoping for reward, it involves modesty, it involves humility, it involves joy, it involves faith, it involves diligence, it involves mindfulness, it involves absorption, it involves insight, it involves roots of virtue, it involves disinterest in the lower vehicles, it involves dedication to the vast, it involves concern for beings, and it involves perpetuating of the lineage of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha.{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-058-005-119}}} Lord of nāgas, when the mind of omniscience embraces these thirty-two aspects, one will have all the qualities of a buddha endowed with every supreme attribute. 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-058-005-120}}}“Furthermore, lord of nāgas, the mind of omniscience relates to the wisdom of omniscience in terms of sixteen accumulations. What are the sixteen? They are the accumulations of discipline, of learning, and of insight; the accumulations of worshiping and serving the Thus-Gone One, of staying in solitude, and of teaching the Dharma just as one has heard it; the accumulations of the four abodes of Brahmā, of pleasing qualities, and of the path of the ten virtues; the accumulation of the ornaments of body, speech, and mind; the accumulation of ascetic practices and austerity; the accumulations of having few desires, of contentment, and of complete seclusion; the accumulation of dedication as formulated in the three sections;{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-058-005-121}}} the accumulation of tranquility; the accumulation of special insight; {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-058-005-870,folio:F.209.b}}} and the accumulation of all roots of virtue. Lord of nāgas, the mind of omniscience correlates to omniscient wisdom in terms of these sixteen accumulations. 
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-058-005-122}}}“Furthermore, lord of nāgas, when the mind of omniscience avoids the twenty-two misguided and wrong paths that are to be renounced, omniscient wisdom will be attained. What are the twenty-two? They are avoidance of (1) the mindset of a hearer; (2) the mindset of a solitary buddha; (3) pride; (4) excessive pride; (5) duplicity; (6) attachment to worldly spells; (7) engagement with mistaken views; (8) being disheartened; (9) fear; (10) arrogance and combativeness; (11) desire, aversion, and delusion; (12) karmic obscuration; (13) confusion with regard to phenomena; (14) praising oneself and disparaging others; (15) teachers who withhold the Dharma; (16) forgetful perception; (17) unvirtuous companions; (18) hostility toward spiritual friends; (19) the discordant factors of the six perfections, namely miserliness, negative attitude, intolerance, laziness, distraction, and flawed insight;{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-058-005-123}}} (20) nihilism and eternalism; (21) developing unskillful methods; and (22) all types of wrongdoing. Lord of nāgas, if the mind of omniscience is free of these twenty-two misguided and wrong paths and has renounced them, omniscient wisdom will be attained. 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-058-005-124}}}“Furthermore, lord of nāgas, when bodhisattvas who have developed the mind of omniscience are ennobled by twelve banners, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-058-005-871,folio:F.210.a}}} it will be very difficult for māras and their armies, indeed for any opponent, to vanquish them. What are the twelve? They are the ennobling banner of discipline; the ennobling banner of absorption; the ennobling banner of insight; the ennobling banner of liberating wisdom; the ennobling banner of great compassion; the ennobling banner of skillful means; the ennobling banner of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness; the ennobling banner of the lack of sentience, life force, and individuality in living beings; the ennobling banner of being free of extreme views and having understood dependent origination; the ennobling banner of being blessed by the Buddha through the complete purity of one’s own mind; the ennobling banner of omniscient wisdom that is free of assumptions, thoughts, concepts, and discursiveness; and the ennobling banner of not forgetting the mind of awakening. Lord of nāgas, when bodhisattvas who have developed the mind of omniscience are ennobled by these twelve banners, it is very difficult for māras and their armies, indeed for any opponent, to subdue them.

Therefore, lord of nāgas, a bodhisattva who aspires to having such a tree of the mind omniscience must not forget the mind of omniscience. Lord of nāgas, I have not seen any excellent qualities lacking in those who have the mind of omniscience. Lord of nāgas, someone who possesses the seed of a tree also possesses its roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits. In the same way, lord of nāgas, someone who possesses the mind of omniscience also possesses the factors of awakening. Therefore, lord of nāgas, this teaching, which is a Dharma gateway on the qualities of bodhisattvas, should be remembered. Retain it, recite it, and explain it widely to those around you! This is how you should train.”
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-058-005-153}}}When the Blessed One delivered this teaching on the source of the wisdom of omniscience, seventy-two thousand nāgas from among those assembled there developed the intention to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Young nāgas, female nāgas, and nāga kings reached acceptance in keeping with the roots of virtue {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-058-005-877,folio:F.213.a}}} that they had produced, and five hundred of the assembled bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. Those nāga boys, nāga girls, and nāga kings ascended into the sky and disappeared, leaving in their wake a great cloud of benzoin resin that showered a rain of heavenly uragasāra sandalwood powder as an offering to the Blessed One. The land and everything in it was covered and enveloped by a lattice of pearls, and it was as if the entire surface of the sky were covered with necklaces and half-moon ornaments.
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-058-005-154}}}Then the nāga king Anavatapta said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the way the Thus-Gone One has explained the mind of awakening and the mind of omniscience—its qualities, aspects, and practices—is wonderful! Blessed One, please explain the pure path of bodhisattvas, known as the domain of the bodhisattvas, by which bodhisattvas who enter the pure path will reach the ultimate and will, throughout the intervening period, be neither discouraged nor satisfied until they perfect the ten powers, the four types of fearlessness, and all the qualities of a buddha! Thus-Gone One, please explain it.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-058-005-155}}}“Lord of nāgas,” the Blessed One replied to the nāga king Anavatapta, “the pure path of bodhisattvas is eightfold. What are the eight parts? They are the path of the perfections, the path of the means of attraction, the path of the higher perceptions, the path of the immeasurable attitudes, the eightfold path, the path of impartiality toward all beings, the path of the three gateways to liberation, {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-058-005-878,folio:F.213.b}}} and the path of reaching acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. Lord of nāgas, these are the eight.

It consists in hearing with the divine ear the words of the blessed buddhas and, having heard those words, remembering them and not squandering them.

Because they have reached the thusness of all phenomena. That is why they are called thus-gone ones.

They realize that such performance is formation, that formation is the same as nonformation, and that nonformation is the same as formation. This is the true understanding of the body, the full understanding of the body’s true nature. What is the body’s true nature? Throughout the entire extent of the past, its true nature has been unborn; throughout the entire extent of the future, its true nature will not transmigrate; and in the present, its true nature is like a hallucination—this is the true nature of the body.

Even when such an undefiled body is born in the world, it does not lose its undefiled limit of reality. Even when the undefiled body takes on and manifests a physical form, this naturally inherent true nature of the body is not lost.

They desire that which is experienced as pleasant, and they are averse to that which is experienced as unpleasant. But ultimately all speech is free from desire, free from aversion, and free from delusion. Since even the words desire, aversion, and ignorance are unborn, all speech should be considered pure. Speech is unreal, and that which is unreal is not afflicted by the afflictions of desire, aversion, and delusion. Speech is beyond grasping—it cannot be grasped by the eye up to cannot be grasped by the mind. Speech is like the wind—it does not arise without a combination of elements that are then transformed by air. Speech is like an echo. Speech—both that of the noble ones and those who are not noble ones—is to be found neither inside nor outside, nor anywhere else. Investigations and analyses of its source and location reveal it to be unfindable, groundless, and unknowable. Therefore, lord of nāgas, whatever speech of the Thus-Gone One arises, as well as the speech of other beings, is all nonexistent, unreal, false, and deceptive conditioned phenomena.”

The mind is by nature luminosity, yet it is subject to sudden affliction, and by proximity to affliction it becomes further afflicted. Bodhisattvas give no opportunity for those temporary afflictions to arise. They understand that naturally pure mental acts that gather{{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-058-005-182}}} roots of virtue are mind’s very nature. They understand that mental acts that radiate love to all beings are the same as the mind. They understand that mental acts that dedicate all roots of virtue toward awakening are the same as awakening. In this way, although those of pure mind may coexist with those who engage in lustful behavior, they are not in any way polluted by the stains of desire. Likewise, though they may coexist with those who behave with aversion, delusion, or all afflictions in equal measure, they are not polluted by those stains. In the same way, even when those with pure minds are born in the desire realm, {{page:{number:24,id:UT22084-058-005-886,folio:F.217.b}}} they cannot be outshone by the peaceful brahmās of the form realm. Rather, it is the bodhisattvas who outshine the gods. Likewise, even when those with pure minds are born into the form realm and coexist with beings of the desire realm, they do not become disheartened. Nor do they despise those beings who assert a self. In the same way, if those with a pure mind rest evenly in all the absorptions and attainments, they will not be reborn through the power of those concentrations and absorptions.

Similarly, it is not cultivated by meditating on the mundane or the supramundane, on the compounded or the uncompounded, on the defiled or the undefiled, or on the flawed or the flawless.

{{milestone:{label:1.123,id:UT22084-058-005-229}}}When the Blessed One had given the teaching, the nāga king Anavatapta was satisfied, pleased, delighted, and joyous. Full of joy and happiness, he said, “Will the Blessed One please accept my invitation to the Thus-Gone One, and to his assembly of monks and his clairvoyant bodhisattva great beings, to stay at my home, Lake Anavatapta, for three months? {{page:{number:30,id:UT22084-058-005-892,folio:F.220.b}}} I wish to serve the Blessed One to the best of my ability. Why? Because, Blessed One, I cannot repay the Thus-Gone One for the Dharma I have heard from him, yet I pray that through my offerings to the Thus-Gone One I may never be separated from this Dharma teaching in the future. Blessed One, please accept this invitation out of kindness for me!”
The Blessed One declined.
{{milestone:{label:1.124,id:UT22084-058-005-231}}}“For just two months?”
The Blessed One again declined.
{{milestone:{label:1.125,id:UT22084-058-005-233}}}“For just half a month?”
At that point, out of kindness, the Blessed One signaled his acceptance by remaining silent. The nāga king Anavatapta understood by his silence that the Blessed One had agreed. He was satisfied, pleased, delighted, and joyous. Full of joy and happiness, he bowed to the feet of the Blessed One along with his relatives and retinue. As he left the Blessed One and returned to his homeland, clouds gathered in the sky, thunder cracked all around, and a torrent of rain fell in Jambudvīpa. 
{{milestone:{label:1.126,id:UT22084-058-005-235}}}When he arrived at his home, the nāga king Anavatapta summoned his eldest son, Sudatta, and gave instructions to his five hundred sons who were followers the Great Vehicle—Sudatta, Susthita, Peaceful, Peaceful Faculties, Vikurvāṇa, Great Splendor, Boundless Splendor, Possessor of Boundlessness, Possessor of Boundless Qualities, Colorful, Supreme Splendor, Inexhaustible Wealth, Patient One, and others. 
{{milestone:{label:1.127,id:UT22084-058-005-236}}}“Listen, my sons. I have invited the Thus-Gone One, along with his assembly of monks and his clairvoyant bodhisattva great beings, to stay here for half a month. Out of kindness for me, the Blessed One has accepted. {{page:{number:31,id:UT22084-058-005-893,folio:F.221.a}}} You must therefore stop meeting to indulge in games, frivolities, and displays of physical prowess. You must abandon your lustful frolics and your attachment to forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects. Instead, you must aspire to worship the Thus-Gone One, and you must serve the Blessed One with constant mindfulness, alertness, and heedfulness. Why? Because the Blessed One is heedful, and so are those in his entourage; he is omniscient, and so are those in his entourage; he is at peace, and so are those in his entourage; and he is disciplined, and so are those in his entourage. Therefore, for half a month you must not enter your wives’ quarters; you must neither have nor entertain lustful thoughts; you must neither have nor entertain malicious thoughts; and you must neither have nor entertain harmful thoughts. Gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans will also come to listen to the Blessed One teach the Dharma. You must behave and comport yourselves in such a way as not to disrespect them, just as you would not disrespect me. If you worship the Blessed One in this way, his entourage will be delighted.”
{{milestone:{label:1.128,id:UT22084-058-005-237}}}Having instructed his family members in this way, the nāga king Anavatapta, so as to worship to the Blessed One, conjured a variety of shining vajras ornamented with blue beryl and Jambu River gold and spread across an area seven hundred leagues wide between the king of snow mountains and the great lake Anavatapta. In the same area, he conjured eighty-four thousand precious trees each adorned with all kinds of precious gems and replete with all kinds of flowers and fruits. {{page:{number:32,id:UT22084-058-005-894,folio:F.221.b}}} On each of those eighty-four thousand precious trees, replete with all kinds of precious leaves, he conjured a thousand pink pearl necklaces. In the surrounding area, he conjured mansions lavishly decorated with all sorts of precious things, with thousands of raised parasols, banners, and flags. And in those mansions were eighty-four thousand lion thrones draped with millions of divine fabrics, their golden bases studded with all kinds of precious gems. And in every mansion were thousands upon thousands of nāga maidens, each bearing flowers, incense, perfumes, garlands, ointments, powders, fabrics, parasols, banners, and flags. The sky above the mansions was covered with jeweled canopies, from which hung eight thousand multicolored fabrics, parasols, banners, and flags, each flag threaded with strings of small jeweled bells that rang with sweet and pleasing notes when stirred by the wind. Finally, he prepared delicacies rich with a hundred flavors. The day after the nāga king Anavatapta had finished making these arrangements, he gathered his relatives and retinue together and, with palms pressed together, offered the following verses to invite and exhort the Blessed One:

{{milestone:{label:1.140,id:UT22084-058-005-250}}}Aware of the invitation of the nāga king Anavatapta, the Blessed One said to his monks, “Monks, in keeping with the invitation of the nāga king Anavatapta, we will stay in his kingdom for half a month, so appoint a caretaker for the monastery and take up your Dharma robes and alms bowls!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.141,id:UT22084-058-005-251}}}Surrounded and escorted by seventy-two thousand bodhisattvas and two thousand hearers with great powers and miraculous abilities, the Blessed One miraculously left Vulture Peak Mountain. As he flew through the sky, light streamed from the Blessed One’s body and illuminated this entire great trichiliocosm. By that light, the gods of the desire realm and the form realms could see the Blessed One surrounded by his great retinue, traveling through the sky toward the great lake Anavatapta, and they thought, “With such a retinue, the Blessed One is surely going to teach the Dharma there, where he will stay for half a month.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.142,id:UT22084-058-005-252}}}And so, hundreds of thousands of gods followed the Blessed One. All who wished to see the Blessed One, to hear the Dharma, and to see the residence and the arrangements prepared by the nāga king Anavatapta also followed along. As they set out after the Blessed One, some gods brought down rains of divine flowers. As they set out after the Blessed One, some gods brought down rains of uragasāra sandalwood powder. As they set out after the Blessed One, some gods played instruments, sang songs, and proclaimed his praises. {{page:{number:35,id:UT22084-058-005-897,folio:F.223.a}}} As they set out after the Blessed One, some gods raised silk streamers, parasols, banners, and flags and caused rain to fall. The gods of the pure abodes followed the Blessed One with their peaceful bodies radiating magnificent, colorful, divine light that outshone even the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars. Śakra, Brahmā, and the protectors of the world also followed the Blessed One with their respective arrays.
{{milestone:{label:1.143,id:UT22084-058-005-253}}}Surrounded by diverse groups of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, bodhisattvas, and great hearers, the Blessed One came to rest on the southern slope of the king of snow mountains. There he said to Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, go and ask the nāga king Anavatapta if it is time for the Thus-Gone One to arrive.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.144,id:UT22084-058-005-254}}}At that moment, Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana rose into the sky to the height of seven palm trees. Transforming his body into that of a garuḍa, the king of birds, he surveyed the realm of the nāga king Anavatapta. The nāgas and female nāgas who lived in Lake Anavatapta were terrified, and with their hairs standing on end, they fled in all directions exclaiming, “Where have all those roaming garuḍas come from?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.145,id:UT22084-058-005-255}}}Raising his right hand, the nāga king Anavatapta calmed them. He comforted and reassured those nāgas and female nāgas, saying, “Do not be afraid! Do not be afraid! These are manifestations of Venerable Maudgalyāyana!” {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-058-005-898,folio:F.223.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.146,id:UT22084-058-005-256}}}After Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana had presented his message, he left. Then the nāga king Anavatapta, along with his sons, wives, relatives, and retinue, went to where the Blessed One was, bearing all kinds of flowers, powders, incense, ointments, fabrics, parasols, banners, flags, instruments, and drums, and on arrival he offered them as gifts to the Blessed One in the appropriate manner. 
{{milestone:{label:1.147,id:UT22084-058-005-257}}}Then the Blessed One, surrounded by many gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, bodhisattvas, and great hearers, proceeded to the abode of the nāga king Anavatapta. There he sat down cross-legged upon the lion throne that had been set out and arranged for him, while all the members of his entourage also took their respective seats. Once he saw that the Blessed One was seated, the nāga king Anavatapta, with his own hands, served him food and drinks—many fine dishes beyond the realm of human experience, full of heavenly tastes and endowed with a hundred different flavors. Only when he saw that he had finished eating, had put away his alms bowl, and had washed his hands did he request the Blessed One to teach the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.148,id:UT22084-058-005-258}}}And so, that afternoon, after the Blessed One had risen from his rest, he sat down to teach the Dharma. At that time, the entire area, for a thousand leagues all around and up into the sky, was filled with gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans. {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-058-005-899,folio:F.224.a}}} The nāga king Anavatapta then said to the Blessed One, “Thus-Gone One, please teach us the Dharma so that the beings gathered here who have not yet generated the mind intent on awakening may generate it; so that those who have already generated the mind of awakening may reach irreversibility; so that those who fear saṃsāra and who follow neither the path of training nor the path of no more training may follow the path of training and the path of no more training; so that those who are inclined toward saṃsāra may become averse to it; so that this congregation of nāgas and yakṣas may become free from inferior rebirths and instead reach exalted rebirths; so that bodhisattvas who are inclined toward the profound may develop pure minds and thoughts; and so that I may uphold the sacred Dharma, both while the Thus-Gone One is living and after he has passed into parinirvāṇa!”
{{milestone:{label:1.149,id:UT22084-058-005-259}}}The Blessed One said to the nāga king Anavatapta, “Lord of nāgas, listen carefully and pay attention. I shall tell you.”
{{milestone:{label:1.150,id:UT22084-058-005-260}}}“Yes, Blessed One, I will,” he replied, and the nāga king Anavatapta listened as the Blessed One had instructed.
{{milestone:{label:1.151,id:UT22084-058-005-261}}}The Blessed One continued, “Lord of nāgas, when bodhisattvas have a single quality, they enthrall the entire world with its gods. What is that quality? It is heedfulness that holds fast to the profound Dharma. What is this heedfulness that holds fast to the profound Dharma? Lord of nāgas, it is when bodhisattva great beings engage with dependent origination and, by being without the two extreme views and asserting neither existence nor nonexistence, see that all phenomena depend on conditions.{{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-058-005-262}}} Understanding that no phenomena can be considered as arising without causes, {{page:{number:38,id:UT22084-058-005-900,folio:F.224.b}}} they think, ‘That which depends on causes also depends on conditions, and that which depends on conditions is unborn. That which is unborn is empty. That which is empty is beyond signs. That which is beyond signs is beyond wishes. That which is beyond wishes is peaceful. That which is peaceful is at peace. That which is at peace does not stir. That which does not stir is inert by nature. That which is inert by nature depends on conditions. That which depends on conditions is without self and without ‘mine.’ That which is without self is inexpressible in accordance with the absence of apprehending.
{{milestone:{label:1.152,id:UT22084-058-005-263}}}“Lord of nāgas, those bodhisattva great beings rely on four reliances. What are the four? They rely on meaning rather than words; they rely on wisdom rather than consciousness; they rely on the definitive meaning rather than the provisional meaning; and they rely on the true nature rather than individuals. These are the four reliances on which they rely. 
{{milestone:{label:1.153,id:UT22084-058-005-264}}}“What is this ‘meaning’? What is this ‘wisdom’? What is this ‘definitive meaning’? What is this ‘true nature’? Meaning refers to emptiness, which does not elaborate views. The absence of signs is the meaning; it does not elaborate conceptual thinking. The absence of wishes is the meaning; it does not elaborate the three realms. This is what is referred to as meaning.
{{milestone:{label:1.154,id:UT22084-058-005-265}}}“Furthermore, lord of nāgas, ‘meaning’ is the absence of distinction between phenomena and non-phenomena. It means that phenomena, usually presented in terms of categories, cannot be expressed by words and sounds and are baseless and without individuality—beings and persons are merely conventional designations. This is what is referred to as meaning.
{{milestone:{label:1.155,id:UT22084-058-005-266}}}“Furthermore, meaning refers to concern for the Dharma but not for attainment. {{page:{number:39,id:UT22084-058-005-901,folio:F.225.a}}} How do bodhisattvas concern themselves with the Dharma but not with attainment? They do not concern themselves with the eye and its forms, with the ear and its sounds, with the nose and its smells, with the tongue and its tastes, with the body and its tactile objects, or with the mind and its mental phenomena. They do not concern themselves with fixation on form or with fixation on feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness. They do not concern themselves with fixation on the desire realm, the form realm, or the formless realm. They do not concern themselves with fixation on a self, nor with fixation on a being, a life force, a soul, a person, or an individual. They do not concern themselves with fixation on the form body of the Thus-Gone One. They do not concern themselves with fixation on the words of the Dharma. They do not concern themselves with fixation on the Saṅgha. They do not concern themselves with fixation on generosity, nor with fixation on discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, or insight. They do not concern themselves with fixation on any phenomena whatsoever. That is how bodhisattvas concern themselves with the Dharma. The fact that such things cannot be expressed by the word meaning is what is referred to as the meaning.

It is the knowledge that the aggregates are like illusions, the knowledge that the elements are indivisible from the realm of phenomena, and the knowledge that the sense sources are like an empty village. {{page:{number:40,id:UT22084-058-005-902,folio:F.225.b}}} It is the knowledge that discerns phenomena. It is knowing which beings have supreme faculties and which do not. It is knowing that in mindfulness there can be no forgetfulness. It is knowing that in the applications of mindfulness there is no recollection or mental engagement. It is clearly discerning virtue and nonvirtue in the correct exertions. It is knowing the bases of miraculous power in terms of the lightness of body and mind. It is knowing the stages of the strengths. It is knowing that the powers are indomitable. It is knowing that in the branches of awakening all phenomena are understood. It is knowing that the path is unconditioned. It is knowing that tranquility is peace. It is knowing that special insight is the thorough discernment of phenomena. It is knowing that there is no birth in all of the past, that there is no passing away in all of the future, and that there is no abiding between the two. It is knowing that the body is like a reflection, that words are like echoes, and that the mind is like an illusion. This is what is referred to as wisdom.
{{milestone:{label:1.157,id:UT22084-058-005-269}}}“What are the discourses of ‘definitive meaning’? They are the teachings on dependent origination. They teach the absence of self, from the cessation of ignorance up to the cessation of old age and death. They teach the lack of a being, a life force, a soul, and a person. As it says in the discourses, ‘If, like a raft, even the Dharma is to be discarded, one need not speak of non-Dharma.’{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-058-005-270}}} Without reference points, they teach the three gateways to liberation, the sameness of the three times, and the three trainings. They regard all composite things as being beyond going, and they do not posit an immutable reality. They teach that the transcendent strengths and powers and the insight of the bodhisattvas transcend conception {{page:{number:41,id:UT22084-058-005-903,folio:F.226.a}}} and mental engagement.

The Great Vehicle based on the six perfections is known as the true nature. The vehicle of the solitary buddhas based on dependent origination is known as the true nature.

The Thus-Gone One has not turned the wheel of Dharma in order to teach what is and what is not the Dharma. He has not turned the wheel of Dharma in order to deconstruct what is the Dharma and what is not the Dharma. The Thus-Gone One has not turned the wheel of Dharma in order to teach that the dharma of ordinary beings is inferior and that the Dharma of the noble ones is vast. Friends, the Thus-Gone One has turned the wheel of Dharma in order to show that both the dharma of ordinary beings and the Dharma of the noble ones are by nature unborn. Since this wheel of Dharma has been turned thoroughly and completely and without interruption, it is the wheel that turns unceasingly. Since the wheel of Dharma is turned in accordance with the law of dependent origination, it is the wheel of the unborn. Since it is not turned with duality—it is not turned to teach about the sensory perceptions, from the eye and forms up to the mind and mental phenomena—it is the wheel of nonduality. Since the wheel is not turned while focusing on past, present, or future phenomena, it is the wheel of the absence of reference points. Since the wheel is turned without adhering to the view of a self, a being, a life force, a soul, or a person, it is the wheel of emptiness. Since the wheel is not turned while fixating on signs or entertaining mental constructs, it is the wheel of signlessness. Since the wheel is not turned for the sake of the attainments of the desire realm, the form realm, or the formless realm, {{page:{number:66,id:UT22084-058-005-928,folio:F.238.b}}} it is the wheel of wishlessness.

{{milestone:{label:1.310,id:UT22084-058-005-434}}}Satisfied by the Blessed One’s answers to their questions, the five hundred young nāgas were pleased and rejoiced, and they worshiped the Blessed One. For the sake of all the activities, each of them, along with their relatives and retinues, offered him their own bodies and said, “From today until your parinirvāṇa, Blessed One, we will always serve you, and we will be delighted to guard and conceal this holy Dharma in its entirety. And, Blessed One, after the Thus-Gone One has passed into parinirvāṇa, {{page:{number:71,id:UT22084-058-005-933,folio:F.241.a}}} we will continue to worship your exalted body, undivided and whole, and will seek the seven precious materials so as to make a shrine for it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.311,id:UT22084-058-005-435}}}Then Venerable Mahākāśyapa said to the young nāgas, “If out of great compassion for all beings the Thus-Gone One manifests relics the size of mustard seeds, then you noble sons saying, ‘We will worship the Thus-Gone One’s exalted body, undivided and whole,’ amounts to wanting to obstruct virtuous qualities for most beings.”
{{milestone:{label:1.312,id:UT22084-058-005-436}}}The five hundred young nāgas replied to Venerable Mahākāśyapa, “Revered Kāśyapa, do not say such things! Your insight does not compare to the insight and wisdom of the Thus-Gone One! The Thus-Gone One is omniscient and all seeing. He is endowed with the power of wisdom that manifests blessings and miraculous power. If he so wishes, he could project his body, undivided and whole, into each of the many realms of gods, nāgas, and yakṣas in this great trichiliocosm, and all those beings would know that they were worshiping the Thus-Gone One and no one else. Revered Mahākāśyapa, when the Thus-Gone One passes into parinirvāṇa, the minds of all those beings, through their devotion, will be blessed with bodily relics. Revered Mahākāśyapa, just one such bodily relic the size of a mere mustard seed in the Highest Heaven could illuminate the whole of Jambudvīpa. Such is the miraculous power of the Buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:1.313,id:UT22084-058-005-437}}}Venerable Subhūti then said to those sons of the nāga king, “Noble sons, do thus-gone ones {{page:{number:72,id:UT22084-058-005-934,folio:F.241.b}}} pass into parinirvāṇa?”
“Revered Subhūti, all who are born will pass into parinirvāṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:1.314,id:UT22084-058-005-439}}}“Noble sons, do you consider the Thus-Gone One as having been born?”
“He was born in the way that thusness arises.”
{{milestone:{label:1.315,id:UT22084-058-005-441}}}“If he was born in the way that thusness arises, then there is also no arising of any phenomenon.”
“Revered Subhūti, the arising of thusness is the arising of buddhahood.”
{{milestone:{label:1.316,id:UT22084-058-005-443}}}“If the arising of buddhahood is like this, what is parinirvāṇa like?”
“Revered Subhūti, just as there is no birth, there is no cessation. This is how the wheel of Dharma is turned. This is what parinirvāṇa is like.”
{{milestone:{label:1.317,id:UT22084-058-005-445}}}At this point in the discussion, the Blessed One spread a jeweled net over all the precious and fragrant lotus flowers of Lake Anavatapta, each the size of a cart wheel and with a hundred thousand petals. At their center, a single exquisite and magnificent precious lotus burst forth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.318,id:UT22084-058-005-446}}}When he saw this array of lotuses, Venerable Ānanda asked, “Blessed One, whose arrival is augured by these signs?”
The Blessed One responded, “Ānanda, wait a moment and you will see.”
{{milestone:{label:1.319,id:UT22084-058-005-448}}}Soon after the Blessed One said these words, sixty thousand bodhisattvas appeared from below, arriving from the world system called Ratnavyūhā, the buddha field of the Blessed Ratnaketu, and sat cross-legged on the precious lotuses. Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, who also appeared, was seated on the central lotus. 
{{milestone:{label:1.320,id:UT22084-058-005-449}}}All those assembled there {{page:{number:73,id:UT22084-058-005-935,folio:F.242.a}}} joined their palms together in awe and prostrated to the bodhisattvas. Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta then rose up into the sky, and the gods Śakra and Brahmā and other gods greeted him from above by holding a jeweled parasol over him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.321,id:UT22084-058-005-450}}}Joining Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, the remaining bodhisattvas also rose into the sky, to a height of seven palm trees. As an offering to the Blessed One, they caused to rain down from the sky flowers such as had never been seen or heard of before, and from those flowers came a voice: “The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Ratnaketu inquires after the health of the Blessed One—‘Does the Blessed One have any small pains or discomforts? Is he enjoying vitality, strength, and well-being?’ Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta has arrived with eighty thousand bodhisattvas to listen to the teaching on the Dharma gateway of the pure path of the nāga king Anavatapta. Rejoice in this Dharma discourse of the Blessed One!”
{{milestone:{label:1.322,id:UT22084-058-005-451}}}Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta and the bodhisattvas then descended from the sky, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, and took their seats on the precious lotuses. 
{{milestone:{label:1.323,id:UT22084-058-005-452}}}Although he already knew the answer, the Blessed One then inquired of Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, for what reason have you come here with these bodhisattvas?”
{{milestone:{label:1.324,id:UT22084-058-005-453}}}Mañjuśrī replied, “While staying in the Ratnavyūhā world system, the buddha field of the blessed, Thus-Gone Ratnaketu, we heard that the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma in this place. {{page:{number:74,id:UT22084-058-005-936,folio:F.242.b}}} We came here because we wished to behold the Blessed One and listen to this Dharma discourse.”
{{milestone:{label:1.325,id:UT22084-058-005-454}}}Venerable Mahākāśyapa then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how far from here is the Ratnavyūhā world system, the buddha field of the blessed, Thus-Gone Ratnaketu, such that these holy beings have arrived here so quickly?”
{{milestone:{label:1.326,id:UT22084-058-005-455}}}Mañjuśrī replied, “Revered Mahākāśyapa, if you, a master of miraculous powers, were to travel to that world system, your lifespan would end and you would pass into parinirvāṇa before reaching that buddha field. That is how far the world system is from here.”
{{milestone:{label:1.327,id:UT22084-058-005-456}}}The Blessed One said, “Kāśyapa, these bodhisattva great beings have arrived from the Ratnavyūhā world system, having crossed as many buddha fields as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers.”
{{milestone:{label:1.328,id:UT22084-058-005-457}}}The elder then asked, “Blessed One, how long did it take them to arrive here?”
Mañjuśrī replied, “Elder, it took them the same amount of time it takes for a mind to be liberated from defilements with no further appropriation.”
“Then the speed with which these holy beings have arrived here is amazing!” exclaimed the elder.
{{milestone:{label:1.329,id:UT22084-058-005-460}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “How long did it take for the elder Mahākāśyapa’s mind to be liberated?”
“It took just an instant.”
{{milestone:{label:1.330,id:UT22084-058-005-462}}}“Elder, is your mind liberated?” asked Mañjuśrī.
“Yes, Mañjuśrī, it is liberated.”
{{milestone:{label:1.331,id:UT22084-058-005-464}}}“What was binding your mind?” asked Mañjuśrī. “What was it liberated from?”
“Mañjuśrī,” replied the elder, “if my mind was bound, it would not be liberated, {{page:{number:75,id:UT22084-058-005-937,folio:F.243.a}}} and there would be no liberating wisdom vision.”
{{milestone:{label:1.332,id:UT22084-058-005-466}}}“If Revered Mahākāśyapa’s mind is not bound, what is its liberation?”
“Understanding the absence of bondage is liberation.”

A present mind? The past is gone, the future is yet to come, and the present does not abide anywhere, so what is that mind that understands? What is that which is understood?”
“Mañjuśrī, it is cessation; it is devoid of anything that can be regarded as a mind.”
{{milestone:{label:1.334,id:UT22084-058-005-470}}}“Revered Kāśyapa, can mental cessation be understood?”
“No, mental cessation cannot be understood.”
{{milestone:{label:1.335,id:UT22084-058-005-472}}}Mañjuśrī replied, “The mind in which all has ceased is a downfall, because in it nothing is understood.”
“Mañjuśrī, please speak on this. I am unable to reply to you.”
{{milestone:{label:1.336,id:UT22084-058-005-474}}}“What do you think, Revered Mahākāśyapa,” asked Mañjuśrī, “does an echo have eloquence?”
“No. And why is that? Because an echo is dependently arisen.”
{{milestone:{label:1.337,id:UT22084-058-005-476}}}“Revered Mahākāśyapa, are all phenomena not like echoes?”
“Yes, Mañjuśrī, they are.”
{{milestone:{label:1.338,id:UT22084-058-005-478}}}“What do you think, Revered Mahākāśyapa, can an echo’s eloquence be interrupted?”
“It is interrupted when no words are uttered.”
{{milestone:{label:1.339,id:UT22084-058-005-480}}}“That is right, Revered Mahākāśyapa. A bodhisattva’s eloquence is interrupted when no questions are asked. Revered Mahākāśyapa, if I were questioned for an eon, my eloquence would continue for that whole eon.” {{page:{number:76,id:UT22084-058-005-938,folio:F.243.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.340,id:UT22084-058-005-481}}}Venerable Mahākāśyapa then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please exhort Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta to teach in such a way that this assembly will derive meaning, benefit, and well-being for a long time, such that the true nature of phenomena may be directly perceived.”
{{milestone:{label:1.341,id:UT22084-058-005-482}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Prajñākūṭa, who was seated in that assembly of bodhisattvas, said to Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, what is the elder Mahākāśyapa thinking? Why does he teach in an inferior way? Why is he called an elder?”
Mañjuśrī replied, “He is a hearer, and as such he has not overcome fear.”
{{milestone:{label:1.342,id:UT22084-058-005-484}}}Prajñākūṭa then asked, “Has he not entered the Great Vehicle?”

“Noble son, the blessed, Thus-Gone Śākyamuni teaches the Dharma from the perspective of three vehicles. What are those three? They are the vehicle of the hearers, the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, and the Great Vehicle. There are thus three vehicles. Why? Because there are beings who are inclined toward the inferior.”
{{milestone:{label:1.344,id:UT22084-058-005-488}}}“Mañjuśrī, if emptiness is boundless, signlessness is boundless, and wishlessness is boundless, then why fabricate limited notions?”

{{milestone:{label:1.348,id:UT22084-058-005-492}}}Then Venerable Mahākāśyapa asked the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, “Noble son, how does the Thus-Gone Ratnaketu teach the Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:1.349,id:UT22084-058-005-493}}}“He teaches with tales of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and he teaches about the single taste, origination from the boundless Dharma, irreversibility, becoming a buddha, not being inclined toward any other teachings, and omniscient wisdom. Beings who have not overcome fear are not born there, so the Dharma teachings of that blessed one are like that.”
{{milestone:{label:1.350,id:UT22084-058-005-494}}}Then, the nāga king Anavatapta addressed Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta: “Mañjuśrī, as for the thus-gone one that you came here wishing to behold—is it form that is beheld as a thus-gone one?”
“No, it is not.”

{{milestone:{label:1.354,id:UT22084-058-005-502}}}“Is it the suffering of form, its selflessness, peacefulness, emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and absence of formation that is beheld as a thus-gone one?”
“No, it is not.”

{{milestone:{label:1.361,id:UT22084-058-005-516}}}“Mañjuśrī, what is a thus-gone one like?”
“Lord of nāgas, a thus-gone one is equal to the unequaled, peerless, and incomparable. Unequaled means unrivaled. Equal to the unequaled means he is unmatched. He is peerless because he is not defined by the characteristics of form. He is incomparable because he is beyond marks and signs. Lord of nāgas, this is how a thus-gone one is, and this is how he should be seen. However, he cannot be seen with the physical eye, the divine eye, or the eye of insight. Why? Because the physical eye sees light, and a thus-gone one is neither light nor darkness and therefore cannot be seen with the physical eye. Because the divine eye has the defining characteristic of formation, and a thus-gone one is utterly beyond formation and therefore cannot be seen with the divine eye. Because the eye of insight has the defining characteristic of understanding origination, {{page:{number:79,id:UT22084-058-005-941,folio:F.245.a}}} and a thus-gone one is utterly beyond origination and therefore cannot be seen with the eye of insight either.”

Even for us, it has not been without benefit to come here and hear about that way. It should be known that in the villages, towns, cities, districts, countries, and royal palaces where this Dharma teaching is practiced, the Thus-Gone One will not pass into parinirvāṇa, and the sacred Dharma will not disappear.

The emptiness of the conduct of those with insight is the emptiness of the conduct of those with confused insight. That sameness of conduct is known as engaging in nonconduct. Furthermore, lord of nāgas, the emptiness of the conduct of those who indulge in desire is the emptiness of the conduct of those who are free of desire.

That is why this is known as engaging in nonconduct.”
{{milestone:{label:1.368,id:UT22084-058-005-527}}}“Mañjuśrī, why is it said that bodhisattvas engage in nonconduct?”
“Lord of nāgas, from the first time they develop the intention to reach awakening until they reach the seat of awakening, bodhisattvas who are committed to virtuous conduct, unborn conduct, insubstantial conduct, {{page:{number:81,id:UT22084-058-005-943,folio:F.246.a}}} conduct devoid of apprehension, groundless conduct, conduct devoid of afflictions, conduct devoid of essential nature, conduct beyond origination, conduct beyond movement, baseless conduct, authentic conduct, and ritual conduct{{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-058-005-529}}} are those who engage in the conduct of nonconduct. When bodhisattvas engage in unborn conduct, they are liberated, through their commitment to insight, into the absence of characteristics and the concordant absence of movement. Then, without passing beyond the extent of nonduality, they directly realize the limit of reality without perceiving a limit. This is how bodhisattvas reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.”
{{milestone:{label:1.369,id:UT22084-058-005-530}}}The nāga king Anavatapta then said to Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, what is it like to reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena?”

Just as acceptance of the three times is momentary, so, too, are all beings are momentary. How are they momentary? The afflictions of desire, aversion, and delusion are momentary. Just as all beings are momentary, so, too, are the afflictions that arise from mistaken views momentary. In this way, a bodhisattva who has wisdom, who has reached acceptance of the unborn, correctly sees all beings as liberated. Why? That bodhisattva thinks, ‘Just as my own afflictions are momentary and unreal, the afflictions of all beings are momentary and unreal. Liberation is beyond the roots of those afflictions and beyond their power. If they are not liberated, then no one would pass beyond suffering. Therefore, they are liberated and abide in the essential nature of liberation.’ This is how bodhisattvas with wisdom do not become disheartened while bringing beings to maturity. Why? Because they correctly see that since all phenomena are unbound, they are intrinsically liberated.

They are not confused by delusion concerning any domain, nor have they reached being without attachment to any domain—they abide in the extent of being free of attachment, yet in order to bring beings to maturity, they do not reject any domains, and they experience their domains without affliction. They roam within the domains of Māra, yet they do not discard the characteristic of the essential nature of the buddhas’ domain.

Lord of nāgas, emptiness is the entrance to the flawlessness of bodhisattvas, but since they also manifest skillful means, they generate great compassion for those beings who adhere to mistaken views. Signlessness is the entrance into the flawless state of the bodhisattvas, but since they also manifest skillful means, they generate great compassion for those who indulge in conceptual thinking. {{page:{number:85,id:UT22084-058-005-947,folio:F.248.a}}} Wishlessness is the entrance into the flawlessness of bodhisattvas, but since they also manifest skillful means, they generate great compassion for those who form wishes.

They understand that phenomena are uncompounded, yet they still accumulate the roots of virtue that mature as the thirty-two major marks of a great being. They are utterly calm and at peace, yet they do not abandon their previous commitment to conquer ignorance—the lack of calm and peace—and latent tendencies and to settle their mind, mental faculty, and consciousness evenly in the mind of omniscience. They have conquered all forms of pride and are expert in discerning the faculties of all beings. They proclaim the qualities of the noble ones yet diligently remain in the midst of ignoble phenomena. They have no mental constructs, yet they engage with mental constructs. They are utterly at peace, yet they support those who are not at peace. They are constantly unwavering and immovable, yet they still accomplish the ornaments of the buddha fields. Lord of nāgas, this flawlessness of bodhisattvas transcends the world but does not turn away from it. Lord of nāgas, this noble absorption of being endowed with insight and skillful means in this way is the entrance into the flawlessness of bodhisattvas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.380,id:UT22084-058-005-547}}}“For example, lord of nāgas, when it comes to the entrance into the flawlessness of hearers, the quality of not falling into errors is known as entering the stream.

Lord of nāgas, the entrance into the flawlessness of hearers is not transcendent, although it leads with certainty to the attainment of fruition. The entrance into the flawlessness of bodhisattvas is transcendent. Rather than leading to the hearers’ attainment of fruition, it brings one closer to ultimate fruition—the seat of awakening. Therefore, the flawlessness of hearers is limited, while the flawlessness of bodhisattvas is unlimited.
{{milestone:{label:1.381,id:UT22084-058-005-548}}}“Lord of nāgas, imagine two persons who have fallen into a deep crevasse. One of them is strong, diligent, courageous, skilled, well prepared, and clever. After he has fallen there, he manages to pull himself out of that crevasse through his own great effort, while the other person, who is weaker and unskilled, remains stuck at the bottom. Similarly, lord of nāgas, bodhisattvas, through the power of their insight, see and realize that all phenomena are empty, signless, wishless, and unfabricated, and having perfected skillful means through their great compassion toward all beings, they abide in the mind of omniscience, while those who follow the vehicle of the hearers achieve their result by means of the intellectual analysis of phenomena. Lord of nāgas, in that analogy, the deep crevasse represents uncompounded phenomena, the diligent person represents a bodhisattva, and the person who is unable to climb out of that crevasse into which he has fallen represents a follower of the vehicle of hearers. Lord of nāgas, those who hear about this flawlessness will certainly proceed to unsurpassed, perfect awakening {{page:{number:87,id:UT22084-058-005-949,folio:F.249.a}}} and will approach the flawlessness of bodhisattvas.”

I go for refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. Due to the wisdom of the Buddha, I have now properly understood the nature of awakening through the nature of the mind, and the nature of all phenomena through the nature of awakening. I will now explain this. Blessed One, those who do not listen to this teaching on the Dharma gateway of the pure path have fallen under the sway of Māra. Why? Because, Blessed One, bodhisattvas who are skilled in this Dharma teaching are skilled in all paths that lead to emancipation.”
{{milestone:{label:1.383,id:UT22084-058-005-550}}}Then Venerable Subhūti asked the nāga prince Vikurvāṇa, “Noble son, when you spoke of awakening to perfect buddhahood by realizing the nature of the mind, what did you mean by the nature of the mind?”
“The nature of the mind is the nature of Revered Subhūti.”
{{milestone:{label:1.384,id:UT22084-058-005-552}}}“What is the nature of Subhūti?”
“It is the nature of desire, aversion, and delusion.”

“It is the nature of concepts and thoughts. Why? What do you think, Subhūti? Without thoughts, would desire, aversion, and delusion arise?”
“No.”

Revered Subhūti, you asked what it is that we call the nature of the mind. Luminosity is the nature of the mind, and the luminosity of the mind is beyond desire, aversion, and delusion.”

“Revered Subhūti, afflictions arise based on wrong views, but the nature of the mind is never afflicted in any way. Revered Subhūti, if the nature of the mind were inherently afflicted, it could never be purified. Therefore the nature of the mind is not afflicted, since as it is said, ‘when afflictions are thoroughly understood, they will be purified.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.388,id:UT22084-058-005-560}}}Subhūti then asked, “Noble son, how are afflictions thoroughly understood?”
“Revered Subhūti, to thoroughly understand the afflictions is to correctly comprehend that things arise based on conditions and that when conditions are not there, they do not arise.”
{{milestone:{label:1.389,id:UT22084-058-005-562}}}“Noble son, how is a bodhisattva to be properly diligent?”
“Revered Subhūti, when a bodhisattva rests without engaging with anything they are properly diligent. Furthermore, Revered Subhūti, whenever a bodhisattva great being gives teachings on the liberation of the hearers and solitary buddhas without falling into that liberation themselves, this is also the proper engagement of a bodhisattva. Furthermore, Revered Subhūti, whenever a bodhisattva great being comprehends that because their own afflictions are void the afflictions of all beings are also void, this is also the proper engagement of a bodhisattva. Furthermore, {{page:{number:89,id:UT22084-058-005-951,folio:F.250.a}}} when the engagement of a bodhisattva is seen as disengagement, and when disengagement is seen as engagement, this is also the proper engagement of a bodhisattva.”

But since those who are disengaged do not take rebirth in the three realms, a bodhisattva taking rebirth through skillful means is referred to as engagement. Revered Subhūti, bodhisattvas exerting themselves in this way is what is meant by being properly diligent.”
{{milestone:{label:1.392,id:UT22084-058-005-566}}}The Blessed One gave his approval to the nāga prince, saying, “Holy being, the teaching on the proper engagement of bodhisattvas that you just gave through the power of the Buddha is excellent, excellent!

Then, together with his retinue of wives, sons, and relatives, the nāga king Anavatapta took refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha with all his goods. He offered his kingdom to the Blessed One and his assembly of monks, saying, “Blessed One, this is my prayer: In my kingdom, there are four great rivers, which flow into the four great oceans.

All humans living there will fly through the sky by the power of the five higher perceptions. The luxuries and pleasures of those humans will be like those of the gods in the Heaven of Joy. Those beings will not engage in sexual acts; instead, they will all enjoy and aspire to the joy of the Dharma, and their afflictions will be pacified.

Once they have gathered, the Thus-Gone One will rise up in the sky to a height of seven palm trees. There, he will sit on a lion throne and teach them the Dharma.
