{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-058-006-845}}}Thus did I hear at one time: The Blessed One was residing on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of sixty-two thousand monks, and with seventy-two thousand bodhisattva great beings who had gathered from the worlds of the ten directions. All of them had developed the higher perceptions. They had attained recollection, unobstructed eloquence, and absorption. They were perfectly mindful, intelligent, realized, devoted, humble, and modest. Their motivation was firm and indivisible like vajra. They perfectly applied themselves to all the qualities of buddhahood, and they had developed the most noble motivation. Without ever themselves forsaking the mind set on awakening, they caused others to adopt that same attitude. They were generous, self-controlled, restrained, gentle, and patient. Everything that was pleasant they would give away, and knew how to dedicate these acts. Their bodies, speech, and minds were adorned with the ornament of discipline. They had an impartial attitude toward all beings and they had donned the powerful armors of patience and gentleness. They had exercised diligence for countless billions of eons, and they reveled in the wisdom of the concentrations, liberations, absorptions, attainments, and higher knowledges. They were experts in the wisdom and insight of unobstructed eloquence with respect to the distinctions of all words. Their minds were unshakeable like Mount Sumeru.  Like earth, water, fire, wind, and mountains they were free of attachment and anger. They were abiding in great love and their splendor was unobstructed. They were abiding in great compassion and always diligent in caring for all beings. They were abiding in great joy and were delighted by the joy of Dharma. They were abiding in great equanimity and had reached nondual cognition. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-058-006-1521,folio:F.254.b}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-058-006-846}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-058-006-847}}}They had completely transcended the eight worldly concerns—gain, loss, fame, disgrace, praise, blame, pleasure, and suffering. They had utterly defeated all the multitudes of wicked opponents and conquered the hostile forces of Māra and the afflictions. Their presence was as rare as the sight of the uḍumbara flower and, without being asked, they acted as virtuous friends for all sentient beings, always accompanying them until nirvāṇa. They uttered the great lion’s roar, resounding with the profound Dharma of the Buddha as well as with fearlessness. They were marked by the seal of the thus-gone ones. They taught clearly without any disturbance and their actions accorded with their words. They were diligent in the Dharma-way of suchness, and their light eclipsed the light of the sun and the moon. Their voices resounded throughout the ten directions, they contemplated all buddha qualities, and they upheld the treasury of the Dharma jewel. Their minds were focused on keeping the lineage of the Three Jewels unbroken. They were skilled in traveling to an infinity of buddha realms. They had the intelligence that is grounded in the discernment of all distinctions. To see and hear them was so beneficial that it was overwhelming. They constantly exerted themselves to bring sentient beings to maturity and they had reached the highest level of mastering insight and methods. They taught the Dharma to all sentient beings in the appropriate manner, knowing those who were of the highest faculties and those who were not.  They were skilled in observing the conduct of all sentient beings and they were naturally skilled in the pursuits and imputations of all beings. Due to their great fearlessness, they were dauntless, and they were utterly at peace from old age, sickness, death, and the afflictions. They had created roots of virtue in relation to a boundless number of billions of buddhas. They had gathered the accumulation of merit that completes the excellent major and minor marks, and they had also gathered the accumulation of wisdom. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-058-006-1522,folio:F.255.a}}}{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-058-006-848}}}{{note:{index23,id:UT22084-058-006-849}}}{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-058-006-850}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-058-006-851}}}They were inclined toward all the qualities of emptiness, the absence of marks, and the absence of wishes. They were free from aspiration. They were confident in the insight that all beings and phenomena are like illusions, mirages, dreams, reflections of the moon in water, optical illusions, echoes, and space. They were experts in the wisdom that teaches in the words of all languages, and they had achieved the four correct knowledges related to phenomena, meaning, language, and eloquence. They had actualized the power of supramundane insight, obtained the ten powers that possess great might, and developed the perceptions of the physical eye, the divine eye, the insight eye, the Dharma eye, and the buddha eye. They were experts in the wisdom that engages in all the ways of gathering the accumulations related to the branches of the path. They knew the procedures for developing the understanding of the bodhisattvas’ scriptural collection. They turned the irreversible Dharma wheel. They had reached the absorption of the seal of characteristics. They were experts in the wisdom related to the absorption of the vajra circle. They had manifested the absorption that controls all phenomena. They held the torch of the supreme Dharma Jewel. They perceived the mindstreams of all beings and were experts in seeing their thoughts.

“Noble son, you should understand through what we have said here that all sounds come from space. The essential nature of space is sound; it ceases as soon as it is perceived, and once it ceases, it remains within the essential nature of space. It is therefore said that all phenomena are the same as space. Even though they are surely beyond perception and impossible to know, they are expressed through words and verbal expressions, and those expressions are designations. Those who understand verbal expressions in this way are not attached to anything; those who are not attached do not generate conceptual elaboration; those who do not generate conceptual elaboration do not transmigrate; those who do not circle around are unbreakable; those who are unbreakable do not take birth; those who are not born do not perish; those who do not perish are pure; those who are pure are immaculate; those who are immaculate are stainless; those who are stainless are clear; and clarity is the nature of the mind. The nature of the mind is penetration; penetration overcomes all marks; and those who overcome all marks are said to enter into faultlessness.  The bodhisattvas who enter into faultlessness reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. They are therefore referred to as ‘bodhisattvas who have entered into faultlessness and reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.’ {{page:{number:30,id:UT22084-058-006-1549,folio:F.268.b}}}

Why is that so? Because emptiness is not different from persons; persons themselves are emptiness. They have reached acceptance with respect to both marks and the absence of marks. Why is that so? Because the essential nature of marks is the absence of marks. They have reached acceptance with respect to both wishes and the absence of wishes. Why is that so? Because the characteristic of the essential nature of wishes is the absence of wishes. They have reached acceptance with respect to beings’ inherent transcendence of suffering as well their process of death and rebirth. Why is that so? Because death and rebirth have the essential nature of being illusions. Noble son, the bodhisattvas who have reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena in this way are without cessation and are not in conflict with any phenomenon. Their acceptance with respect to the self encompasses all sentient beings, and it also encompasses all phenomena, since it is beyond coming and going. They correctly know that all phenomena abide within the realm of phenomena and that the same goes for all beings. That attainment whereby nothing is attained is referred to in conventional terms as ‘gaining acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.’ This acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena cannot be expressed, described, or demonstrated. Why is that so? Because its meaning is inexpressible, beyond words, and indescribable.

{{milestone:{label:1.170,id:UT22084-058-006-1063}}}“Lord of the kinnaras, you should know that bodhisattvas are skilled in means if they possess thirty-two features. What are those thirty-two? They are as follows: (1) Bodhisattvas look after beings by not eliminating themselves. (2) They abide by great merit in order to ripen all beings.  (3) They do not search for worthy recipients of generosity since all beings are worthy recipients of generosity. (4) They do not hanker after grandeur so that they can ripen destitute beings. (5) They manifest as mutes and stutterers to cause all beings to control their speech. (6) They assume the forms of women in order to ripen women and girls. (7) They assume the physical forms of children to ripen children. (8) They assume all types of physical forms to ripen others in the appropriate manner. (9) Even though they are not insane, they display that state to ripen insane beings. (10) They assume the physical forms of madmen and disturbed beings to teach the Dharma to those who have such propensities. (11) They forsake the aggregate of discipline, accumulated over a hundred years, to ripen beings. (12) They display all forms of pleasure, delight, and enjoyment to cause others to adopt the Dharma. (13) They assume the physical forms of beings earning their livelihood through unsuitable and crooked means to ripen beings who have such propensities. (14) When the wives of merchants, householders, or kings have no children and experience the painful torment and suffering of wanting a child, the bodhisattvas accept being born as their child in order to cause them to develop faith in virtue and to ripen them. (15) In order to distribute food, beverages, wealth, and other goods to destitute beings wandering in the wilderness, they manifest as merchants leading many travelers, place great treasures in front of them, and teach them the Dharma after having offered them vast amounts of wealth. (16) They eliminate the torments of those who experience the pain of suffering before teaching them the Dharma through their miraculous powers. (17) They manifest great treasures in front of those who have lost their wealth before teaching them the Dharma to purify their livelihood.  (18) They manifest as renunciates among the non-Buddhist carakas and parivrājakas to make them adopt the teachings of the Buddha. (19) They appear within brothels or harems where they display attractive female bodies to ripen those who are caught by the hook of lust. (20) To ripen others with the Dharma in accordance with their individual inclinations, they manifest within great gatherings and large groups where they beautify whole areas with the music of their drums, kettle drums, flutes, and conch shells; they then display various crafts within those gatherings and teach others the Dharma through the sounds of those musical tunes. (21) Through the power of their higher perceptions and out of great love, they offer food and beverages to travelers who suffer from a lack of food and beverages; then they teach them the Dharma once they are relieved from hunger and thirst. (22) They manifest as blind people among those who are born blind and, through their miraculous powers, they offer food and beverages to such destitute blind people, and cause them to recover their eyesight so that they can see their physical forms; then they teach them the Dharma in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. (23) They intentionally manifest as thieves to ripen hundreds of beings who have engaged in various types of evil activities and who have been incarcerated in the royal prisons; when they are identified as rogues, they enter a prison where, through their miraculous powers, they wash and anoint the bodies of the prisoners, dress them in fine clothes, and offer them food and beverages until they are fully satiated; then they release them from their tight shackles and teach them the Dharma in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening.  (24) To ripen beings who are led to the place of their execution at the king’s command, and who are tormented by suffering and the fear of dying, bodhisattva great beings miraculously emanate manifestations that free such condemned prisoners who are being led to their execution from their shackles; they then teach the Dharma to those beings who have been relieved from fear and whose lives have just been saved, in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. (25) Bodhisattva great beings skillfully remain wherever beings are involved in quarrels, disputes, fights, and conflicts about possessions, wealth, fields, household materials, male servants, female servants, workers, or soldiers; through their miraculous powers they settle the conflicts by giving away their possessions, wealth, and precious materials and, once the different parties have been thus reconciled, they cause them to embrace unsurpassed and perfect awakening. (26) Even though the major and minor parts of bodhisattvas’ bodies are fully functional, they skillfully manifest with impaired abilities, in order to ripen sentient beings. (27) Even though the bodhisattvas’ conduct is perfect, they manifest all kinds of disturbed forms of conduct to ripen sentient beings. (28) Bodhisattvas adept in skillful means manifest themselves as non-Buddhists, and to attract non-Buddhists in faraway lands, who live in demonic domains under the influence of demons, to the teachings of the Buddha, they proclaim the praises of the Three Jewels in front of them. (29) To skillfully ripen others, bodhisattvas give up the concentrations, liberations, absorptions, and attainments, and intentionally take rebirth within the desire realm; they describe the suffering of birth to those who wish for nirvāṇa,  and they teach about nirvāṇa to cause those who have attained disengagement to cultivate the highest path. (30) Bodhisattvas skillfully display the bodies of buddhas to those who aspire to reach nirvāṇa but who have not yet entered the faultless state. (31) To cause beings who have faith in the Buddha and whose minds are settled to embrace the mind set on awakening, they teach them how to attain understanding of this conditioning factor. Lord of the kinnaras, you should know that bodhisattva great beings are skilled in means through those thirty-two features.” {{page:{number:63,id:UT22084-058-006-1582,folio:F.285.a}}}{{page:{number:64,id:UT22084-058-006-1583,folio:F.285.b}}}{{page:{number:65,id:UT22084-058-006-1584,folio:F.286.a}}}{{page:{number:66,id:UT22084-058-006-1585,folio:F.286.b}}}{{note:{index65,id:UT22084-058-006-1064}}}{{note:{index66,id:UT22084-058-006-1065}}}

Among the retinue of the Blessed One, eighteen thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. The kinnara king Druma reached the absorption called the lamp of insight.

Then, eight thousand sons of the kinnara king Druma offered shade to the Blessed One with an array of precious lotuses and eight thousand precious parasols.

His body shone with light, illuminating this entire great trichiliocosm with a bright light. All the various musical instruments of the kinnaras, the gandharvas, the mahoragas, and the gods of the desire realm then started to resound with the most delightful music, without anyone playing them. The sound of music also rang out from all the fragrant, flowering, and blooming trees growing on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana. Next, myriads of light rays shone from all the pores of the Blessed One’s skin, and lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels manifested on the tip of each light ray. At the heart of each lotus flower bodhisattvas appeared, displaying pure bodies adorned with the thirty-two marks of great beings. Then, through the power of the Buddha, all the musical instruments resounded with questions in the form of verses,  each of which was clearly answered by the bodhisattvas, who replied in chorus, also in verse.{{page:{number:68,id:UT22084-058-006-1587,folio:F.287.b}}}

Noble son, the king Nimiṃdhara worshiped the Thus-Gone One Ratnaskandha in a boundless manner, revering him and his six hundred million bodhisattvas for ten million years with offerings of beautiful Dharma robes, food, bedding, medicine, provisions, and every other type of pleasing article. Supported by those roots of virtue, he gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening together with his forty thousand women, one thousand sons, and eighty-four thousand other beings. Then, they venerated the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One Ratnaskandha, for ten million years. Later on, when his eldest son named Vratapariśuddha was enthroned, he relinquished his kingdom, shaved his head and cut his beard, put on the saffron-colored Dharma robes, and with trust went forth from the household into homelessness under that blessed one’s teaching. Then, as each prince following in the line of succession became enthroned, the elder sons followed the example of their father and went forth, one after the other. Noble son, such was the length of the Thus-Gone One’s lifespan.

Ānanda, if noble sons and daughters possess that light of insight—the light of insight of the thus-gone ones—they will possess the light of insight by which the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas know the thoughts and concepts of all past, present, and future beings. Ānanda, you should know that those who listen to this Dharma teaching, develop trust in it, keep it in mind, hold it, read it, comprehend it, fully teach it to others, correctly understand it, and practice it accordingly are sublime beings who will never forget the mind set on awakening but will exert themselves in ripening beings. They will don the armor of great love and compassion, defeat demons and opponents, and proceed toward the seat of awakening.”{{page:{number:124,id:UT22084-058-006-1643,folio:F.315.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.474,id:UT22084-058-006-1449}}}Then venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how much merit is generated by a noble son or daughter who is devoted to this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, who keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, comprehends it, and fully teaches it to others?”
“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One, “imagine that a noble son or daughter practices generosity by, in the morning, filling this entire great trichiliocosm with the seven precious substances and offering this to the stream enterers, the once returners, the nonreturners, the worthy ones, the solitary buddhas, and the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas. Similarly, imagine that he or she practices generosity by filling, at noon, during the afternoon,  at dusk, during nighttime, and at dawn, all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm with the seven precious substances and offering this to all of them. Then, imagine that he or she practices generosity on that scale for a year, for a hundred years, for a thousand years, and for a hundred thousand years. What do you think Ānanda, would that noble son or daughter generate a lot of merit on that basis?”{{page:{number:125,id:UT22084-058-006-1644,folio:F.316.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.475,id:UT22084-058-006-1451}}}“Blessed One, the amount of merit generated would be huge! It would be immeasurable! Well-Gone One, the merit generated would be boundless! Blessed One, the heap of merit generated from doing this for one day is immeasurable, to say nothing of the heap of merit generated by practicing such generosity for a hundred thousand years!”
{{milestone:{label:1.476,id:UT22084-058-006-1452}}}“Ānanda, think about this and understand this point: if someone who strives to reach awakening, to turn the wheel of Dharma, and to liberate beings is devoted to this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, and then keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, and comprehends it, such a noble son or daughter who follows the Great Vehicle will generate an amount of merit larger than that. That being so, what need is there to mention the merit generated by those who put it into practice in accordance with reality?! Why is that? Because, Ānanda, keeping in mind even a single verse of four lines from this Dharma teaching, holding it, reading it, comprehending it, and fully teaching it to others is known as generosity, and that generosity surpasses all other forms of generosity. Generosity with the Dharma is the supreme form of generosity, assistance with the Dharma is the supreme form of assistance, the act of spreading the Dharma is the supreme form of action,  and the acquisition of the Dharma is the supreme form of acquisition. Why is that so? Because, Ānanda, generosity with the Dharma will cause afflictions to decrease while generosity with material things will merely support the body. Therefore, Ānanda, bodhisattvas who wish to reduce their afflictions should practice generosity with the Dharma authorized by the Buddha. Through this generosity with the Dharma, all extraordinary qualities will be attained. {{page:{number:126,id:UT22084-058-006-1645,folio:F.316.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.477,id:UT22084-058-006-1453}}}“The bodhisattvas who practice generosity with the Dharma will gain thirty-two excellent and valuable benefits. What are those thirty-two? (1) They will develop mindfulness. (2) They will develop intelligence. (3) They will develop understanding. (4) Their desires will decrease. (5) Their anger will decrease. (6) Their ignorance will decrease. (7) They will overcome the afflictions in themselves and others. (8) They will please many beings. (9) The gods will proclaim their praises. (10) They will be protected by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas. (11) They will receive alms after performing service. (12) They will receive Dharma robes, alms, bedding, medicine, and provisions. (13) Their renown, repute, and praise will spread in the ten directions. (14) They will not be harmed by nonhumans. (15) They will be praised by the blessed buddhas. (16) They will guard the sacred Dharma. (17) They will uphold the sacred Dharma of the blessed buddhas. (18) They will not be frightened by any of the lower realms. (19) It will not be difficult for them to be reborn as gods and humans. (20) They will continuously behold the buddhas. (21) They will continuously venerate the Saṅgha.  (22) They will remember their previous lives. (23) They will be reborn into pure buddha realms. (24) They will never be born with impaired faculties. (25) They will attain the thirty-two major marks of great beings. (26) They will manifest the seeds of magnificent retention. (27) They will acquire the cause of uninterrupted eloquence. (28) They will be served by wise beings. (29) They will acquire the cause of great insight. (30) They will quickly attain the light of the Dharma. (31) Improper contemplation will not arise in their minds. (32) They will surpass all forms of mundane generosity related to material things and acquire the inexhaustible Dharma treasure. Ānanda, if bodhisattvas practice generosity with the Dharma, they will acquire those thirty-two excellent and extraordinary qualities.”{{page:{number:127,id:UT22084-058-006-1646,folio:F.317.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.478,id:UT22084-058-006-1454}}}Then, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Blessed one, “Blessed One, I will also uphold this Dharma teaching! After the Blessed One has passed into nirvāṇa, I will ensure that beings who are proper recipients hear it. I will guard them and ensure that they have faith in it. Why? Because, Blessed One, I am pursuing those excellent qualities and the accumulation of merit.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.479,id:UT22084-058-006-1455}}}At that moment, the Blessed One applauded Śakra, lord of the gods. He said, “Kauśika, the lion’s roar by which you have vowed in front of me to uphold the sacred Dharma is excellent, excellent! Kauśika, as long as my sacred Dharma endures, whenever the gods and the demigods are fighting, this root of virtue will cause the demigods to be defeated and the gods to be victorious in battle. This, Kauśika, is due to the fact that this Dharma teaching is excellent. Kauśika,  not apprehending any phenomenon is the gift of fearlessness. Kauśika, whenever the slightest fear arises, it invariably originates in apprehending and dwelling on the view of the transitory collection. Kauśika, those who are free from apprehension uphold the sacred Dharma.” {{page:{number:128,id:UT22084-058-006-1647,folio:F.317.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.480,id:UT22084-058-006-1456}}}Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will renounce the limitless modes of dwelling in the bliss of concentration, and I will go to listen to the Dharma in all the villages, cities, towns, provinces, countries, and royal capitals where this Dharma teaching is practiced. In those places, I will protect, guard, and support all those who preach the Dharma rightfully. Why? Because, Blessed One, the hearers, the solitary buddhas, Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, and the universal monarchs originate from this Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:1.481,id:UT22084-058-006-1457}}}The four great kings then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, we, the four great kings, and the great hearers of the Blessed One, will strive to protect, guard, and support this Dharma teaching to ensure that it endures for a long time. Our retinues will ensure that those who do not trust the Buddha and his teachings develop faith and exert themselves for the sake of protecting the teaching of the Thus-Gone One. Blessed One, we will now recite the following secret mantra words to protect the monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners who exert themselves in the teachings of the Buddha, as well as those who trust and guard the teaching of the Blessed One. These secret mantra words will subjugate beings such as yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, kinnaras,  mahoragas, and kumbhāṇḍas, as well as humans, nonhumans, and all those who are hostile toward the teaching of the Buddha:{{page:{number:129,id:UT22084-058-006-1648,folio:F.318.a}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.484,id:UT22084-058-006-1517}}}They both replied, “Blessed One, after the Blessed One has passed into nirvāṇa, we shall both uphold and propagate this Dharma teaching. We shall place this Dharma teaching in the hands of those who teach the Dharma and those noble sons and daughters who have created roots of virtue. We shall look after them to make sure that they trust and uphold this discourse. Blessed One, in the future, when beings hear this Dharma teaching and keep it in mind, hold it, read it, comprehend it, and carry it, it will be known to be due to the blessings of the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Divyamauli.”
{{milestone:{label:1.485,id:UT22084-058-006-1463}}}At that moment, the evil Māra, who was present in the assembly, started to shed tears and wail. He said to the Blessed One,  “Blessed One, your Dharma teachings, starting with the vehicle of the hearers, have never ever given me goosebumps. However, this Dharma teaching that the Blessed One has taught—the seal of the bodhisattvas blessed by the thus-gone ones, the entrance to the path of awakening of all bodhisattvas, the support for all beings—has caused me such painful misery and made me weak! Blessed One, please reach out to me! Please stop expounding this Dharma teaching that causes me such painful misery!”{{page:{number:130,id:UT22084-058-006-1649,folio:F.318.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.486,id:UT22084-058-006-1464}}}“Evil One,” replied the Blessed One, “there are many beings like you who do not trust such a profound teaching, and there are only a few who do, so do not be distressed and stop wailing! Evil One, for example, beings who trust this profound Dharma teaching are as many as a pinch of dust taken from the surface of the earth, while beings who are not devoted to this profound Dharma teaching are as numerous as all the particles of dust on the entire earth. All those beings are like you; all the beings from innumerable realms are like you, so you should be happy, Evil One!”
{{milestone:{label:1.487,id:UT22084-058-006-1465}}}When this Dharma teaching was delivered, countless beings set out for awakening, ninety-two thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, eighty-four thousand beings purified the spotless and stainless Dharma eye with respect to phenomena, and the minds of eight thousand monks became free from defilements without any further appropriation. This great trichiliocosm shook in six ways and was bathed in a dazzling light. A rain of divine flowers fell from the sky, and the melodies of hundreds of thousands of instruments resounded everywhere, without anyone playing them.
{{milestone:{label:1.488,id:UT22084-058-006-1466}}}Billions of gods residing in the sky exclaimed,  “Oh, we have just witnessed a second turning of the wheel of Dharma in Jambudvīpa!
