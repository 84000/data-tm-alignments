The Questions of Brahmadatta
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-059-002-18}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-059-002-377,folio:F.10.b}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas. 
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, together with a great assembly of two hundred fifty thousand monks and a large number of bodhisattva great beings. All of these were bodhisattvas who were versed in extraordinary knowledge, had acquired extraordinary knowledge along with dhāraṇī, samādhi, and unimpeded dhāraṇī, and were skilled in the dhāraṇīs that accomplish the seal of infinite gateways.{{note:{index6,id:UT22084-059-002-21}}} They dwelled in emptiness, they had the experience of signlessness, and they had aspirations that were not imputed. They all had reached the acceptance that phenomena are unarisen.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-059-002-22}}}Then, the bodhisattva {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-059-002-378,folio:F.11.a}}} Amoghadarśin, together with about five hundred bodhisattvas, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. After traveling through several towns, they finally arrived in the region of Pañcāla. When King Brahmadatta learned of the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin’s arrival in his land, he felt pleased and happy, and he rejoiced. Overjoyed and content, he led a large following of people to the place where the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin was staying. When he arrived there, he prostrated by touching his head to the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin’s feet, then sat to one side. His many followers also prostrated by touching their heads to the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin’s feet, then sat to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-059-002-24}}}When he saw that King Brahmadatta and his assembled retinue and attendants were present, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin said to him, “Great King, an anointed king of royal descent who possesses five attributes will continuously progress while traversing saṃsāra and will never take birth in unfavorable states.{{note:{index7,id:UT22084-059-002-25}}} He will also meet and please thus-gone ones. When the blessed buddhas teach the Dharma, he will also master their allegorical speech. He will maintain uninterrupted mindfulness, look attractive, and not lack any sense faculty. The blessed buddhas will also speak to him with words of absolute truth; that is to say, they will demonstrate the four truths.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-059-002-27}}}“What are these five attributes? 
“Great King, an anointed king of royal descent possesses faith. He possesses a mind that is strong in faith and is without animosity. His faith is also demonstrated to be rooted in certainty. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-059-002-379,folio:F.11.b}}} His faith should furthermore be observed in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He gives without deceit. (2) He gives away all possessions completely. (3) He has no excessive pride. (4) He has exceptional clarity. (5) He does not apprehend any fault in the teachings of the noble ones. (6) He does not investigate the best, intermediate, or lesser monks for mistakes. (7) He believes in emptiness. (8) His physical actions are pure. (9) His verbal actions are pure. (10) His mental activity is pure.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-059-002-29}}}“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this first attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-059-002-41}}}“Moreover, Great King, an anointed king of royal descent longs for the Dharma. He always yearns to behold the noble ones, and he insatiably seeks to hear the Dharma. Using his mind he carefully investigates the many things he has learned, and then fully realizes them through experience. Great King, a king should be understood to be endowed with the Dharma if he has ten qualities. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He is without concern for his body or life in his quest for the Dharma. (2) He possesses a mindset that is weary of saṃsāra. (3) He thinks that a householder’s life entails too many faults. (4) He has a mindset that is not concerned with material things. (5) He is critical toward the negative actions that stem from his previous karma, and he does not create future formations. (6) He possesses a mindset that discriminates between all that is attractive and all that is repulsive. (7) Mastering his intent, he perfects the conduct of a bodhisattva and does not privilege words. (8) He is steadfast in his commitments because he seeks wisdom. (9) He fosters awakening in his servants and retinue and completely matures them {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-059-002-380,folio:F.12.a}}} continuously with the gift of the Dharma.

{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-059-002-42}}}“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this second attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-059-002-53}}}“Moreover, Great King, an anointed king of royal descent believes in accepting the profound Dharma and accomplishes the samādhi of emptiness. His interest in the profundity of the Dharma should also be understood in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) His actions accord with his words. (2) He completes all his virtuous Dharma activities with very strong devotion and rids himself of the formations of unpleasant actions. (3) He creates pleasing formations. (4) He does not unjustly suppress individuals who possess power and riches. (5) He provides others with pleasing gifts and eliminates all that is not pleasant. (6) Thinking that all phenomena are empty, he cultivates renunciation. (7) His view is free of contrivance, thus he neither believes in the singularity of the limit of reality nor holds concepts of its multiplicity. (8) He does not use his own qualities to belittle the qualities of others. (9) He does not form definite judgments. (10) He brings those who do not practice into alignment with the inconceivable realm of phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-059-002-54}}}“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this third attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-059-002-65}}}“Moreover, Great King, when an anointed king of royal descent clearly perceives the contamination that comes from the harm of living in this world, he upholds the teachings for the sake of accomplishing unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening. He perseveres {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-059-002-381,folio:F.12.b}}} in generating the power of the six perfections and never tires of fully maturing sentient beings. Furthermore, the ways in which he upholds the teachings should be understood in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He perseveres in attaining samādhi that is unimpeded by the eight worldly concerns. (2) He perseveres in seeking out the dhāraṇīs. (3) He is skilled in ascertaining so that he completely apprehends the supreme Dharma. (4) He never tires of providing various necessities to those who persevere, including clothes, food, bedding, cushions, and medicines to cure sickness. (5) He strives to encourage awakening. (6) He thinks excellent thoughts, speaks excellent words, and performs excellent deeds. (7) He is inclined towards renunciation. (8) He thinks that it is a mistake to delight in being a king. (9) He possesses a mindset that has no concern for any beautiful or pleasant forms. (10) At the very least he does not think that anything is accomplished by only craving kingship. 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-059-002-66}}}“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this fourth attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-059-002-77}}} “Moreover, Great King, an anointed king of royal descent follows the Dharma in guarding, protecting, and shielding those who uphold, read, and teach unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening, which one fully accomplishes in a hundred billion trillion incalculable eons. He likewise punishes beings who are harmful to such individuals in order to completely protect the enjoyment of this resource of Dharma. His effort to completely uphold the supreme Dharma {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-059-002-382,folio:F.13.a}}} should also be understood in ten ways. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) He accomplishes it completely. (2) He regards it as absolutely invaluable. (3) He believes in the Dharma. (4) He always acts without confusion. (5) He desires wisdom and has trust in distinctions of enlightened qualities. (6) He acts as a messenger of the Thus-Gone One. (7) He is a suitable vessel for buddhahood. (8) He holds together the lineage of the Three Jewels. (9) He causes the supreme Dharma to blaze brightly. (10) He completely matures many people.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-059-002-78}}}“Great King, one of royal descent who possesses this fifth attribute and is an anointed king accomplishes these qualities just mentioned.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-059-002-89}}}After this, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin recited the following verses: 
“The king who always has a sincere attitude 
Toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha 
Has indestructible faith and confidence
And never lacks the following qualities. 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-059-002-91}}}“His faith is not contrived but is born from understanding, 
And he does not hang on to anything he owns.
Rather, he feels no regret when it is given away. 
These qualities are a sign of faith. 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-059-002-92}}}“Those whose thoughts are always unsullied
Are unshakable like the indestructible Mount Meru. 
Just as a full vase does not move when it is well placed,
Their faith is absolutely unmoving.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-059-002-93}}}“Those who see without seeing and hear without hearing 
Are immovable like a mountain.
Such are the characteristics of faith,
Which will not change at all in any situation. 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-059-002-94}}}“Wise ones who wish for the Dharma because they wish for peace
Should abandon everything else for the sake of the Dharma
And, after abandoning everything, should not think of it. 
These are the characteristics of those who wish for the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-059-002-95}}}“When a lord of humans who wishes for the Dharma
Does not listen to the eloquent teachings,
Like a rotten seed sown in a bad field,
The pure instructions of the Leader of Beings will not grow. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-059-002-383,folio:F.13.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-059-002-96}}}“Even if one hears them, but thinks, ‘I am wise in them,’ 
Or, ‘I have realized the exact nature of all phenomena,’
One cannot purify their conduct with a sincere attitude;
How can one with a dualistic mind become pure?
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-059-002-97}}}“Those who wish for the Dharma with mindfulness,
Who are respectful, unwavering, not stupid like sheep, 
And are not like a rushing torrent but like a still ocean—
Such are vessels for supreme awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-059-002-98}}}“Those who wish for the Dharma 
Never cling to any outer or inner things.
They are cherished by the knowledgeable and criticized by fools.
These are the ways to recognize people who wish for the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-059-002-99}}}“Therefore, as a king who wishes for the Dharma,
Practice purely after hearing these words,
And don't fixate on mere words or studies; 
There is no wisdom in degenerate thoughts.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-059-002-100}}}“Those who believe in the acceptance of the profound
Do not cling to pleasant or unpleasant forms.
Just like the wind, they have no attachment,
Yet they practice for hundreds of infinite eons. 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-059-002-101}}}“King, if awakening is what you wish for,
Purify your thoughts with a sincere attitude.
Do not remain in this mistaken state
Because of prideful thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine.’
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-059-002-102}}}“You should continuously confess faults.
You should maintain favorable vows.
Regard power and relationships as impermanent.
This absence of support is genuine emptiness. 
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-059-002-103}}}“However many teachings on emptiness you preach,
This is not abiding in emptiness just as it is.
Anyone who acts contrary to reality
Does not accept the profound way. 
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-059-002-104}}}“Thus, this emptiness is totally wrong.
One who knows emptiness just as it is
Will escape the worldly realm and reach supreme awakening
Like the king of geese leaving a swamp.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-059-002-105}}}“After generating respect for the Thus-Gone One,
King, you should examine what he has taught.
King, because the body is going to fall apart completely,
Do not get discouraged on the vehicle to awakening. {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-059-002-384,folio:F.14.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-059-002-106}}}“You should always protect the wise,
Who know the texts, experience, and rites of the Teacher.
Do not fall under the influence of mere words,
For you will undoubtedly remain sick for a long time. 
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-059-002-107}}}“One who examines the teachings thoroughly
Should focus within in order to truly guard them. 
Abandoning the myriad afflictions and karma,
One will attain in particular the supreme awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-059-002-108}}}“Train well in the six perfections.
Through training in them, you will attain supreme awakening. 
Put into practice all that has been taught,
And before long you will achieve the virtues of omniscience. 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-059-002-109}}}“The mind that relates to objects
Like a bee unattached to a flower's nectar
Or a bird leaving no trace in the sky,
Is a mind, O King, that reaches buddhahood.
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-059-002-110}}}“You should follow the Dharma in protecting 
Those who have found acceptance and courage for the profound
And hold the treasury of the buddhas.
Never forsake such wise ones, even at the cost of your life. 
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-059-002-111}}}“There are many people, devoid of Dharma,
Who strive to harm such wise ones;
You should constantly prevent this through punishments,
Or else the way of the Dharma will quickly degenerate. 
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-059-002-112}}}“If the Lord of the World does not appear,
Those wise ones will be the teachers of the world.
They will light the lamp of the Dharma for the benefit of living beings. 
Therefore, devote yourself always to their benefit.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-059-002-113}}}“There are many tens of billions of bodhisattvas
Who do not act for the benefit of sentient beings from their hearts.
They have neither a sincere attitude nor ethical discipline.
The Conqueror will not make prophecies about them. 
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-059-002-114}}}“Those who act in accordance with what I have just described
Are endowed with the experience of nonarising. 
You, King, having listened to these correct practices,
Should abide by these teachings I have revealed.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-059-002-115}}}Thereafter, King Brahmadatta said the following to the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin: “Amoghadarśin, apparently I have all of the shortcomings {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-059-002-385,folio:F.14.b}}} but none of the good qualities. Amoghadarśin, I am contaminated with harmful pollutants. Amoghadarśin, I am strongly addicted to unjust actions. I always intensely seek out wealth and gather attendants. Consequently, my thoughts arise due to a malevolent attitude that I am incapable of removing. Besides that, I have also thrashed others with sticks and struck them with weapons. Therefore, Amoghadarśin, I did not generate the mind of awakening. I generated a malevolent attitude toward others, even in my dreams. Amoghadarśin, I shall now generate with a sincere attitude the unsurpassed, complete, and perfect mind of awakening. Amoghadarśin, if I do not train in the precepts of bodhisattvas as they are delineated, it will amount to deceiving all the blessed buddhas who dwell in the world systems of the ten directions. In order to fully accomplish unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening, I shall act exactly as you have spoken.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-059-002-116}}}Thereafter eighty thousand beings, following after King Brahmadatta, generated the unsurpassed, complete, and perfect mind of awakening for the first time, and they also prayed to achieve the conduct of a bodhisattva as it was expounded. Twenty thousand beings acquired the pure eye of Dharma that is flawless and without defilements with respect to all phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-059-002-117}}}Then, King Brahmadatta said the following to the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin: “Amoghadarśin, out of your love for me and for the benefit of the people gathered here, please consent to remain here at my place to observe the summer retreat. 
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-059-002-118}}}“Amoghadarśin, we may not meet the conditions of being a vessel, {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-059-002-386,folio:F.15.a}}} we may not meet the conditions of having the scope of experience, and we may not be people of equal status to the fortunate ones. Also, since we do not see the Thus-Gone One or listen to the Dharma continuously, our accumulation of the roots of virtue may not be so large, and we may not have matured many sentient beings. Nevertheless, your presence will benefit us.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-059-002-119}}}Then, the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin, along with some five hundred other bodhisattvas, accepted King Brahmadatta’s request out of love for him. King Brahmadatta prepared a variety of bedding, cushions, mats, clothing, and food for the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin and his retinue of five hundred bodhisattvas. He also made various Dharma offerings to the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin.
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-059-002-120}}}At that time, there were sixty monks staying in that place. All of them were lazy, limited in their studies, full of hostile intent, and resentful when others received offerings. They claimed to be bodhisattvas themselves, but were coarse, crude bodhisattvas. They indulged their senses; they were wild, proud, and vain; they talked nonsense and were deceitful like crows. They had no regard for their next lives and no fear of karma; they enjoyed foolish talk, slept excessively, and had desire for what is not the Dharma. Their physical, verbal, and mental actions were without any restraint; they were argumentative, resented those with ethical discipline, and took no interest at all in the knowledge of others.
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-059-002-121}}}They did not even like to see the teacher, let alone fellow practitioners of pure conduct. Thus, they denigrated the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin in a manner that was not in accord with the Dharma. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-059-002-387,folio:F.15.b}}} Moreover, they spread such remarks by visiting the homes of brahmins and householders with little faith, who, as a result of listening, would be born and live as denizens of the great hells for eight hundred million eons. The bodhisattva Amoghadarśin did not tell this to King Brahmadatta because of his compassion for those sentient beings. 
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-059-002-122}}}At that time, King Brahmadatta had a court priest, a brahmin named Thorough Obscurer. He caused a rift between the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin and the monks who were there, and he made rude remarks that were at odds with the Dharma. He also secretly caused a rift between King Brahmadatta and the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin. He furthermore discouraged all those who had developed extraordinary joy in the Dharma and used every possible means to plant disdain for the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin in their minds. Even when he participated in Dharma discussions, he spoke in opposition to the Dharma, thereby carrying out by every means the activities of the crude bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-059-002-123}}}In this regard, bodhisattvas are crude when they possess four attributes. What are these four? They are as follows: (1) They are deceitful like a crow, talk nonsense, and do not accommodate other perspectives. (2) They praise themselves and criticizes others. (3) They are obsessed with this life and have negative thoughts. (4) They aggressively sow discord. Bodhisattvas are crude when they possess these four attributes. 
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-059-002-129}}}The bodhisattva Amoghadarśin completed the summer retreat there in both comfort and suffering, and with happiness and sadness. Why was this so? Well, someone who dwells with a lazy person tends to suffer. Thus, the bodhisattva great being Amoghadarśin observed the summer retreat, and after the three months had passed, he {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-059-002-388,folio:F.16.a}}} made and completed a Dharma robe. He then left, carrying his alms bowl and Dharma robe. After passing through several kingdoms, he finally arrived at the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, where the Blessed One was residing. Arriving there, he touched the Blessed One’s feet with his head to pay homage and sat to one side.
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-059-002-130}}}King Brahmadatta later heard the news that the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin had gone directly to the Blessed One because the resident monks had mistreated him. King Brahmadatta, along with ten thousand others, thus left the region of Pañcāla for Kośala where the Blessed One was residing. Arriving there, he touched the Blessed One’s feet with his head to pay homage and sat to one side. After he sat down, King Brahmadatta said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin left my country too soon.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-059-002-131}}}The Blessed One replied, “Great King, the Thus-Gone One and the hearers of the Thus-Gone One do not share a dwelling with individuals who are jealous, make no effort whatsoever, are fond of gossip, engage in excessive foolish talk, are very poorly behaved, and do not practice. Great King, know that there are ten causes for a person's lack of effort. What are these ten? They are as follows: (1) sleeping excessively, (2) cultivating the blatant pride of thinking oneself wise, (3) praising oneself, (4) criticizing others, (5) being fond of foolish talk, (6) being fond of gossip, (7) being fond of crowds, (8) clinging strongly to wealth, (9) clinging strongly to respect, and (10) being a hypocrite.
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-059-002-132}}}“Great King, an individual who possesses these ten causes {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-059-002-389,folio:F.16.b}}} is known as one who lacks effort.”
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-059-002-144}}}Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses:
“Those who are unreasonable are always inharmonious;
They remain as far from the wise ones
As a corpse in the ocean
Or a creature riding on a bird.
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-059-002-146}}}“Those without faith search for faults in others;
They speak foolishly and are fond of being in a crowd,
They do not respect the teachings of the conquerors,
And they will migrate to the lower realms immediately after death.
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-059-002-147}}}“Those who are lacking have neither mindfulness nor wisdom;
They will not pass into or reach nirvāṇa and do not have ethical discipline,

They stray farther and farther from the path of the noble ones. 
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-059-002-148}}}“Persons who are lacking will talk too much;
They like to laugh and their senses are always distracted;

{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-059-002-150}}}“When a donor makes an offering out of faith,

They will be forced to beg and will go mad. 
Despite obtaining this meritorious platform of the teachings,

With perfect restraint and without being deceptive,

Then the light rays returned, circled around the Blessed One three times, and dissolved into the crown of his head. 
{{milestone:{label:1.146,id:UT22084-059-002-305}}}Then the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin folded his hands and bowed in the direction of the Blessed One and asked him, “Blessed One, what are the causes of your smile? What are the conditions?” 
The Blessed One said, {{page:{number:25,id:UT22084-059-002-401,folio:F.22.b}}} “Amoghadarśin, King Brahmadatta will not fall into any bad state for thirty eons, and after enjoying the bounties of the gods and humans, he will please eight hundred million buddhas. In all his lives, he will be universal emperor. Forsaking the four continents completely, he will respect and revere the blessed buddhas with an intention free of any hostility.
{{milestone:{label:1.147,id:UT22084-059-002-307}}}“Thereafter, he will actually attain buddhahood—unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening—in a buddha field that will be equal in display to Sukhāvatī, and he will become a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha called King of Limitless Display.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.148,id:UT22084-059-002-308}}}Thus, King Brahmadatta felt contented, elated, jubilant, and overjoyed. Happy and blissful, he bowed down with the five points of his body at the feet of the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin. He then said, “Blessed One, because Amoghadarśin endured being with that community of monks for my sake, I sincerely appeal to him for forgiveness.” Out of his love for King Brahmadatta, the bodhisattva Amoghadarśin then forgave him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.149,id:UT22084-059-002-309}}}When the Blessed One spoke thus, King Brahmadatta, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas all rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.
