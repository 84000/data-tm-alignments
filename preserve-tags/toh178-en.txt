The Teaching on the Aids to Enlightenment
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-060-007-23}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-060-007-212,folio:F.240.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-060-007-24}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was residing on Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha accompanied by a great bhikṣu saṅgha of five hundred bhikṣus, and by bodhisattva mahāsattvas such as Maitreya and Mañjuśrī.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-060-007-170}}}At that time, the Bhagavān said to Youthful Mañjuśrī, “Mañjuśrī, having minds that are misguided by the four errors, sentient beings do not see the four truths of the noble ones  as they really are, and therefore they do not transcend saṃsāra, which is actually unreal.” {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-060-007-213,folio:F.241.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-060-007-26}}}When the Bhagavān had said this, Youthful Mañjuśrī requested the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, please explain how sentient beings perceive things and therefore do not transcend saṃsāra.”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-060-007-171}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, it is because they assume a self and something that belongs to a self that sentient beings do not transcend saṃsāra. Why is that so? Mañjuśrī, it is because anyone who considers things in terms of self and other will bring about karma. Mañjuśrī, unlearned and ignorant ordinary beings, not knowing that all phenomena have completely passed into nirvāṇa, perceive them in terms of self and other. With that perception, they bring about the three types of karma: corporeal, verbal, and mental. Reifying what does not exist, they think, ‘I am attached,’ ‘I am averse,’ ‘I am perplexed.’
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-060-007-28}}}“If they go forth under the dispensation of the Tathāgata, they think to themselves, ‘I possess ethics,’ ‘I practice the spiritual life,’ ‘I shall transcend saṃsāra,’ ‘I shall attain complete nirvāṇa,’ ‘I shall become liberated from suffering.’
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-060-007-201}}}“They think, ‘These phenomena are virtuous,’ ‘Those phenomena are nonvirtuous.’
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-060-007-202}}}“They think, ‘These phenomena are to be abandoned,’ ‘Those phenomena are to be brought about,’ ‘Suffering is to be known,’ ‘Its origin is to be abandoned,’ ‘Its cessation is to be realized,’ ‘The path is to be cultivated.’
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-060-007-203}}}“They think, ‘Conditioned states are impermanent,’ ‘Conditioned states are miserable,’ ‘Conditioned states are burning,’ ‘I shall escape from conditioned states.’
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-060-007-31}}}“Through concepts of this kind, they acquire a disenchantment induced by phenomenal characteristics,  and they bring to mind notions induced by phenomenal characteristics. With such thoughts, they think to themselves, ‘One who knows those phenomena is someone who knows suffering.’ {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-060-007-214,folio:F.241.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-060-007-33}}}“With that thought, they then think, ‘I must abandon the origin.’ They are disturbed by all those phenomena, and do not understand them; they are afraid, terrified, and will be further terrified. With such thoughts, they then think, ‘The bringing about of these phenomena, and being disturbed by those phenomena—these things are the origin that is abandoned.’
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-060-007-172}}}“With that thought, they then think, ‘I must actualize cessation,’ and they think, having investigated those phenomena, that they understand what cessation is. With those thoughts, they then think, ‘These are the things that actualize cessation.’
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-060-007-35}}}“With that thought, they then think, ‘I must cultivate the path.’ They go alone to an isolated place, and, by holding those phenomena in mind, they attain tranquility. Holding that disenchantment in mind and having attained tranquility, they disapprove of all phenomena, part from them, turn away from them, and, having withdrawn from them, they produce a mind of dislike.
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-060-007-173}}}“They think, ‘I am liberated from all suffering; what more is there for me to do? I am an arhat.’ Based on this presumption, when at the time of death they see their coming rebirth they become apprehensive, uncertain, and doubtful about the Buddha’s enlightenment. Having died with a mind mired in doubt, they are born in the great hells. 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-060-007-209}}}“Why is that so? It is because they conceive of all those phenomena, which are actually unproduced.”
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-060-007-37}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī then asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, how should one view the four truths of the noble ones?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-060-007-174}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, whoever sees all conditioned states as unproduced has understood suffering. Whoever sees all phenomena as unarisen has abandoned its origin.  Whoever sees all phenomena as having completely passed into nirvāṇa has realized cessation. Whoever sees all phenomena as having no existence has cultivated the path.{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-060-007-215,folio:F.242.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-060-007-39}}}“Mañjuśrī, whoever sees the four truths of the noble ones in this way does not mentally construct and conceptualize, thinking, ‘These phenomena are virtuous,’ ‘Those phenomena are nonvirtuous,’ ‘These phenomena are to be abandoned,’ ‘Those phenomena are to be realized,’ ‘Suffering is to be known,’ ‘Its origin is to be abandoned,’ ‘Its cessation is to be realized,’ ‘The path is to be cultivated.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-060-007-175}}}“Why is that so? It is because they see those phenomena to which ignorant ordinary beings become attached, averse, and perplexed as unproduced, and because they see them as falsely imagined and fabricated. So they do not adopt those phenomena at all, nor do they reject them.
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-060-007-41}}}“Mentally unattached to the three realms, they see all three realms as unproduced, like an illusion, a dream, an echo, and a visual aberration.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-060-007-176}}}“By seeing the nature of all phenomena in that way, they will become free from attachment and aversion toward all sentient beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-060-007-43}}}“Why is that so? They do not perceive the phenomena toward which they would have attachment or aversion. With minds equal to space, they do not perceive even the Buddha, nor do they perceive even the Dharma or the Saṅgha. They do not perceive all phenomena as empty, nor do they harbor doubt regarding any phenomenon. Because they do not harbor doubt, they will not appropriate. Because they do not appropriate, they will attain complete nirvāṇa without further appropriation.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-060-007-44}}}“Mañjuśrī, bhikṣu Subhūti understands all phenomena in such a way, and therefore he does not come to prostrate at the feet of the Tathāgata. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-060-007-216,folio:F.242.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-060-007-177}}}“Why is that so? It is because it would be impossible—if he does not perceive even himself, how would he perceive the Tathāgata?”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-060-007-46}}}Then, Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, how should one view the four applications of mindfulness?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-060-007-178}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, in the future I will teach the bhikṣus the application of mindfulness that carefully considers the body in its ugly aspect. I will teach the application of mindfulness that carefully considers feelings as arising and ceasing. I will teach the application of mindfulness that carefully considers the mind in this way: ‘Regard the mind as having the quality of arising and the quality of ceasing.’ I will teach the application of mindfulness that carefully considers phenomena in such a way that there will be no notion of them as wholes. These teachings will take place.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-060-007-48}}}When the Bhagavān had said this, Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, how should one view the four applications of mindfulness?”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-060-007-179}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, regard them in terms of the allusive speech of the Tathāgata, which is difficult to understand.” {{note:{index8,id:UT22084-060-007-50}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-060-007-51}}}“Bhagavān, please explain how to cultivate the four applications of mindfulness,” requested Mañjuśrī. 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-060-007-180}}}“Mañjuśrī,” replied the Bhagavān, “regarding the body to be like space is the application of mindfulness that carefully considers the body.
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-060-007-181}}}“Mañjuśrī, whoever does not perceive feelings—which, being neither inside, nor outside, are non-existent in both—is applying mindfulness that carefully considers feelings.
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-060-007-53}}} “Mañjuśrī, whoever understands mind to be no more than a mere name is applying mindfulness that carefully considers the mind. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-060-007-217,folio:F.243.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-060-007-182}}}“Mañjuśrī, whoever does not perceive virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral phenomena is applying mindfulness that carefully considers phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-060-007-183}}}“Mañjuśrī, this is how the four applications of mindfulness are to be viewed.”
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-060-007-57}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Bhagavān, how should one view the eightfold path of the noble ones?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-060-007-184}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, whoever sees all phenomena as not unequal, nondual, and not dualistically distinguishable has right view.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-060-007-185}}}“Mañjuśrī, whoever sees by way of not seeing—without conceptualizing, mentally constructing, or falsely imagining any phenomenon—has right intention.
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-060-007-60}}}“Mañjuśrī, whoever sees all phenomena as inexpressible due to having meditated on the sameness of all expressions has right speech.

{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-060-007-69}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Bhagavān, how should one view the five faculties?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-060-007-190}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, whoever has the confidence to see all phenomena as unproduced by virtue of their being intrinsically unproduced has the faculty of faith.
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-060-007-191}}}“Mañjuśrī, whoever does not mentally let go of any phenomenon due to being free from notions of far or near has the faculty of effort. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-060-007-218,folio:F.243.b}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-060-007-194}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, whoever sees all phenomena as devoid of existence because there is neither mindfulness nor attention has the branch of enlightenment of right mindfulness.

I proclaim that they have gone to the other shore, stand on dry land, have reached happiness, have obtained fearlessness, have laid down their burden, are free from dust, have nothing whatsoever, are free of afflictions, have no further appropriation, are arhats, are śramaṇas, are brahmins, are cleansed, are knowers, are those who have gone afar, are pure, are heirs of the Buddha, are Śākya heirs, have extracted the thorns, have crossed the pit, are completely steady, are free from fever, are bhikṣus, are noble ones, and are perfect banners.
