The Prophecy of Dīpaṅkara

Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, together with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks. At that time, the Blessed One, surrounded and attended by a retinue of many hundreds of thousands, was teaching the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-061-008-95}}}The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, you must make your motivation very pure by examining each root of virtue. If you ask why, Ānanda, though I respectfully venerated hundreds of thousands of buddhas, those blessed buddhas did not prophesy that I would achieve unsurpassed complete and perfect awakening, but after I saw the Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara and offered him five utpala flowers, I developed confidence in the selflessness of phenomena and gained the acceptance that phenomena are unarisen. That is why, Ānanda, you should not be content with your roots of virtue.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-061-008-96}}}“If you ask why, Ānanda, in the past, long ago—an uncountable, exceedingly uncountable, vast, immeasurable, and inconceivable number of eons ago—at that time, on that occasion, here in Jambudvīpa, there was a king known as Ajātaśatru, who was shapely, handsome, pleasant to behold, and provided with a supremely rich and fine complexion. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-061-008-97}}}“Ānanda, that king, Ajātaśatru, had eighty-four thousand cities, every one of them dazzling and pleasant to behold, with magnificent gardens, magnificent ponds, magnificent flowers, magnificent fruits, delightful good harvests, and a joyful atmosphere. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-061-008-332,folio:F.192.a}}} They were wealthy, prosperous, and filled with a great multitude of people.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-061-008-98}}}“Ānanda, that king, Ajātaśatru, had a royal palace known as Padmāvatī, and there the king, Ajātaśatru, resided. Now, there was a royal priest of King Ajātaśatru, the brahmin known as Endowed with Islands, who was dear to the king’s heart and never a disagreeable sight. At that time, Ānanda, Ajātaśatru gathered all the people of the four castes and summoned the brahmin Endowed with Islands. Having tied a crown upon his head, he then gave him half his kingdom and proclaimed, ‘Brahmin, you must return to your country and build a royal palace, which you should also name Padmāvatī.’
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-061-008-99}}}“Then, Ānanda, King Endowed with Islands built a royal palace in his country, and he also named it Padmāvatī. Thus, Ānanda, at that time, on that occasion, here in Jambudvīpa there ruled two kings. One was Ajātaśatru, and the other was Endowed with Islands. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-061-008-100}}}“Then, Ānanda, when Endowed with Islands’ principal queen was sleeping blissfully at the top of the palace, the bodhisattva Dīpaṅkara passed away and transmigrated from Tuṣita Heaven, transforming into a white elephant calf. He emanated light rays and entered his mother’s right side. At that time, the principal queen related this event to King Endowed with Islands. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-061-008-101}}}“Then, Ānanda, King Endowed with Islands gathered brahmins who were skilled in interpreting omens, those skilled in divination, and those skilled in making offerings, and he related to them the events of this dream. A brahmin who was skilled in interpreting omens said, ‘O great king, you have gained a great boon! A son of yours, a precious being, is to be born.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-061-008-102}}}“Then, Ānanda, when King Endowed with Islands heard this dream prophecy, he was transported with satisfaction and delight, and in his great joy he was elated and cheered. King Endowed with Islands gave gifts to everyone within the bounds of his kingdom: for those who desired food there was food, for those who desired drinks there were drinks, and for those who desired a vehicle there was a vehicle. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-061-008-333,folio:F.192.b}}} He gave what was suitable and not unwholesome—incense, garlands, ointments, and bedding—and he gave anything, whatever was desired. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-061-008-103}}}“Then, Ānanda, ten months passed and the son of King Endowed with Islands was born—shapely, handsome, pleasant to behold, and provided with a supremely rich and fine complexion. As soon as he was born, there emerged from his body a light such as this: by that light, the whole of the royal palace of King Endowed with Islands was illuminated. Then, at that time, Śakra, the lord of the gods, vanished from his own abode and went to where the child was. There, he spoke benedictions to that child, and he said, ‘As soon as he was born, there emerged from his body a light such as this: by that light, the whole of the royal palace of King Endowed with Islands was illuminated. Because of that, the child should be named Dīpaṅkara.’ Then the child was named Dīpaṅkara. 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-061-008-104}}}“Then, Ānanda, King Endowed with Islands was transported with satisfaction and delight, and in his great joy he was elated and cheered. Again, he gave gifts to everyone within the bounds of his kingdom: for those who desired food there was food, for those who desired drinks there were drinks, and for those who desired a vehicle there was a vehicle. He gave what was suitable and not unwholesome—incense, garlands, ointments, and bedding—and he gave anything, whatever was desired.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-061-008-105}}}“Later, Ānanda, King Endowed with Islands summoned Prince Dīpaṅkara. Having tied a crown upon his head, he gave him half the kingdom and proclaimed, ‘Youth, you must go and stay among the queen’s retinue and play. Be happy and enjoy yourself!’
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-061-008-106}}}“Shortly thereafter, Ānanda, Prince Dīpaṅkara went among the queen’s retinue and mounted a great carriage. Surrounded by a host of ladies, he went to the garden. One of the gods of the Śuddhāvāsa realm displayed people like us—one old and feeble, one struck by illness, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-061-008-334,folio:F.193.a}}} and one who was dead—and he also set a mendicant among them.{{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-061-008-107}}} Prince Dīpaṅkara, having seen this, asked the charioteer, ‘Hey, charioteer, what are these various sights?’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-061-008-108}}}“The charioteer replied, ‘Youth, these are so-called aging, illness, and death. Youth, as long as there are imputations placed upon the true nature, there will be the phenomena of aging, illness, and death. Youth, it is the same for you and the rest of us, for we are merely the residents of saṃsāra.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-061-008-109}}}“The youth asked, ‘Charioteer, who is this one whose head is shaven, who has donned maroon robes, and who is pacified and gazes the mere length of a yoke?’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-061-008-110}}}“ ‘Youth, this is a monk,’ said the charioteer. ‘Having relinquished all sin and developed the sense of delight in regard to liberation, he went forth into homelessness.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-061-008-111}}}“The boy replied, ‘Very good, charioteer! The path of this monk is to be desired,’ and then he turned around and went home.
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-061-008-113}}}“Then, Ānanda, right away, Prince Dīpaṅkara went again to the garden. In the garden he saw the seat of awakening, which had supported{{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-061-008-114}}} many hundreds of thousands of buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-061-008-115}}}“Then, Ānanda, the bodhisattva Dīpaṅkara, having seen that seat of awakening, left behind the entire assembly of men and women a short distance and proceeded in the direction of the seat of awakening. He saw the seat of awakening and circumambulated it three times, and then at the seat of awakening he sat down with his legs crossed. As soon as the bodhisattva Dīpaṅkara took his seat, at that moment, at the first break of dawn, he reached unsurpassed complete and perfect awakening, the highest perfect buddhahood. 
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-061-008-116}}}“Ānanda, as soon as the Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara reached unsurpassed complete and perfect awakening, the highest perfect buddhahood, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-061-008-335,folio:F.193.b}}} there emerged from his body a light such as this: by that light the entire trichiliocosm was illuminated. Then, at that time, Śakra, the lord of the gods, vanished from his own abode and went to where the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha Dīpaṅkara was. There he bowed his head at the feet of the Blessed One and, having made offerings to the Blessed One, he proclaimed these words: ‘Ah! The Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara has emerged in the world! Thus, by that light are all the world realms illuminated.’
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-061-008-117}}}“The Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara remained at the seat of awakening for fifty years, and not a single being approached to see him, pay homage to him, or serve him. If you ask why, because the residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands were happy, they did not approach to see him, pay homage to him, or serve him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-061-008-118}}}“Then, Ānanda, the Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara thought, ‘These residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands, because they are happy, have become exceedingly careless. Surely I should cause them a little distress.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-061-008-119}}}“Then, at that time, the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha Dīpaṅkara manifested a display of miraculous power such that through the manifestation of the display of miraculous power, among the residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands, he emanated a great city made of beryl that was pleasant to behold and filled with a great multitude of people. Those people, moreover, were more beautiful, more pleasant to behold, and adorned with all types of ornaments. However, the residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands, although they were troubled by the people dwelling in the city made of beryl, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-061-008-336,folio:F.194.a}}} were not in the least bit discouraged.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-061-008-120}}}“The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha Dīpaṅkara thought, ‘Since the residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands have become exceedingly careless, surely I should also generate in them a little discouragement.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-061-008-121}}}“Then the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha Dīpaṅkara again manifested a display of miraculous power such that through the manifestation of the display of miraculous power he took control of that great city of beryl so that it would blaze with a great fire. As soon as he took control of it, it caught fire. Then, at that time, those beings and that great city were destroyed, came to an end, and disappeared. Having seen this unpleasant sight, those beings{{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-061-008-122}}} were distressed.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-061-008-123}}}“Then, Ānanda, the residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands, having seen the fall of the beryl city, were frightened and discouraged such that their hair stood on end. They thought, ‘If there is a reason that that city was destroyed, came to an end, and disappeared, it will not be long before we, too, encounter the circumstances of impermanence in this way. Who will protect us?’
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-061-008-124}}}“The thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha Dīpaṅkara then thought, ‘Since these residents of the royal city of King Endowed with Islands have been matured, they are able to understand the Dharma taught by me, they have become worthy of it, and they have developed the competence for it.’
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-061-008-125}}}“At that moment the Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara, knowing the thoughts of those people, rose from the seat of awakening with mindfulness and alertness. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-061-008-337,folio:F.194.b}}} He then set out for the palace of King Endowed with Islands, together with Śakra, the lord of the gods, as his śramaṇa attendant.{{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-061-008-126}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-061-008-127}}}“Ānanda, as soon as the Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara arrived, then, at that time, on the occasion of the first Dharma teaching of the Thus-Gone Dīpaṅkara, twenty thousand beings went forth, and all their minds were liberated from defilements without further appropriation. At the time of the second Dharma teaching, thirty thousand beings went forth, and all their minds were liberated from defilements without further appropriation. At the time of the third Dharma teaching, forty thousand beings went forth, and for all of them the eye of Dharma was purified so that it became stainless and free of blemishes with regard to phenomena. At the time of the fourth Dharma teaching, fifty thousand beings went forth, and all their minds were liberated from defilements without further appropriation.

{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-061-008-131}}}“When that messenger heard from King Ajātaśatru, he traveled to the royal palace of King Endowed with Islands and then to King Endowed with Islands himself, and there, he relayed the message. King Endowed with Islands then went to the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha Dīpaṅkara, and having gone there he bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet. Having sat to one side, he informed him of the situation.
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-061-008-132}}}“The Blessed One replied, ‘Be at ease, great king, and return home. I will travel to the palace Padmāvatī.’
