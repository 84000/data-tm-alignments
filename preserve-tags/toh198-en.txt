Maitreya’s Setting Out
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-061-018-22}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-061-018-259,folio:F.274.b}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-061-018-24}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in the Jeta Grove, within the park of Anāthapiṇḍada at Śrāvastī, together with a great saṅgha of five thousand monks and a great saṅgha of ten thousand bodhisattvas. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-061-018-260,folio:F.275.a}}} All of them had developed the superknowledges, and all the bodhisattva great beings had reached the stage of irreversibility. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-061-018-25}}}At that time, Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta was present in the assembly. The bodhisattva Pratibhānakūṭa, the bodhisattva Playfulness, the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva Mahāsthāma­prāpta, the bodhisattva Candra­prabha­kumāra­bhūta, and the bodhisattva great being Maitreya had also come together and were sitting in the retinue. At one point, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms joined together, he bowed down toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, should I be granted the opportunity, I would like to ask a few questions to the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, so that the Blessed One may settle the matter of my inquiries.” After the bodhisattva Maitreya made his request, the Blessed One remained silent. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-061-018-26}}}Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta then said to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “Maitreya, if you proceed in the following way, the Thus-Gone One will grant you the opportunity so that the matter of your inquiries may be settled: If you do not ask him questions about the vehicle of the buddhas, the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, or the vehicle of the hearers, if you do not ask him questions about how to gain understanding about the aggregates, the elements, and the sense fields {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-061-018-261,folio:F.275.b}}} or to bring an end to desire, anger, and ignorance, and if you do not ask him questions about the perfections and the way to master them, the Thus-Gone One will grant you the opportunity so that the matter of your inquiries may be settled. If you do not ask him questions with the aim of transcending the karmic formations, achieving nirvāṇa, or comprehending the truths, if you do not ask him questions about the path and the way to meditate on the path, if you do not ask him questions with the aim of attaining the fruition, actualizing it, and reaching the state of nonabiding, and if you present your inquiries without using words, the Thus-Gone One will then give you the opportunity so that the matter of your inquiries may be settled. The reason for this, Maitreya, is that the more one imputes, the more attached one will be, and the Dharma teaching of the Buddha, the Blessed One, is nonattachment.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-061-018-27}}}At that moment the venerable Śāriputra said to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, “Mañjuśrī, you speak of ‘imputing.’ But Mañjuśrī, how does one impute?”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-061-018-28}}}“Venerable Śāriputra,” answered Mañjuśrī, “all phenomena are the same in terms of the sameness of emptiness. They are the same in terms of the sameness of signlessness. They are the same in terms of the sameness of wishlessness. They are the same in terms of the sameness of how things really are. They are the same in terms of the sameness of suchness. They are the same in terms of the sameness of the sphere of reality. They are the same in terms of the sameness of the limit of reality. They are the same in terms of their sameness in being nonarising, unceasing, and nonabiding. They are the same in terms of their sameness in being unborn and unoccuring. All phenomena are the same in terms of the sameness of space. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-061-018-262,folio:F.276.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-061-018-29}}}“Venerable Śāriputra, if, while all phenomena are the same, one thinks of them as not being the same, then one is imputing something that does not exist. Thus one might think, ‘This is the Buddha,’ ‘This is the Dharma,’ ‘This is the Saṅgha,’ ‘This is the self,’ ‘This is a sentient being,’ ‘This is a person,’ ‘This is a child of a man,’ ‘This is a human being,’ ‘This is a doer,’ ‘This is an experiencer,’ ‘This is interrupted,’ ‘This is permanent,’ ‘This is an ordinary being,’ ‘This is a hearer,’ ‘This is a solitary buddha,’ ‘This is a bodhisattva,’ ‘This is a wrongdoer,’ ‘This is someone free from wrongdoing,’ ‘This is defiled,’ ‘This is undefiled,’ ‘This is conditioned,’ ‘This is unconditioned,’ ‘This is thorough affliction,’ ‘This is complete purification,’ ‘This is virtue,’ ‘This is nonvirtue,’ ‘This is mundane,’ ‘This is supramundane,’ ‘This is saṃsāra,’ ‘This is nirvāṇa,’ ‘This is an entity,’ ‘This is a nonentity,’ ‘This is existent,’ ‘This is nonexistent,’ ‘This is attainment,’ ‘This is manifest realization,’ ‘This is actualization,’ ‘This is the path,’ or ‘This is the fruition of the path.’ All these are imputations. Why is it so? Because, Venerable Śāriputra, sameness is beyond thought. Those who think in terms of such concepts make imputations upon sameness. They do not make imputations upon a lack of sameness. Those who see sameness without seeing anything are seeing sameness, but those who create imputations perceive things as not sameness. Those who do not reify sameness perceive sameness, but those who impute do not.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-061-018-30}}}When this teaching was uttered, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-061-018-263,folio:F.276.b}}} the minds of two hundred monks were liberated from their defilements with no further grasping. The Blessed One remained silent in order to train those monks.
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-061-018-31}}}The bodhisattva great being Maitreya then said to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, “Mañjuśrī, I do not ask the Thus-Gone One any of these questions, from questions about the vehicle of the hearers, the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, and the vehicle of the perfect awakened ones to questions about the state of nonabiding. Mañjuśrī, I always present my inquiries to the Thus-Gone One in a way that does not contradict suchness. Mañjuśrī, I present my inquiries to the Thus-Gone One in a way that does not contradict suchness. Thus, I take into account the nonobservation of any phenomenon due to disengagement from all phenomena. I acknowledge freedom from the stains of desire, anger, and ignorance due to the immutability of the sphere of reality. I ask in the recognition that there is no transcending saṃsāra—because it cannot be observed—and no attaining nirvāṇa—because there is neither coming from nor going to anywhere at all. Mañjuśrī, I never use any words or verbal expressions. There is nothing to discern with insight, nor is there anything to understand. Here there is nothing at all that is liberated either. This is how I present my inquiries to the Thus-Gone One, since words are empty, and everything is unborn.”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-061-018-32}}}At that point, the bodhisattvas who had gathered in the retinue thought, “Ah! The bodhisattva great being Maitreya only teaches in that way, using indirect and oblique statements, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-061-018-264,folio:F.277.a}}} and yet everything he says is in harmony with reality. His wisdom is indeed profound!”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-061-018-33}}}The bodhisattva great being Playfulness then said, “Blessed One, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya’s certainty about the acceptance of the profound and his skills in teaching it with wisdom and eloquence are amazing! Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, in order to provide assistance and happiness to numerous beings, and to bring benefit and healing to gods and humans, please tell us how much time has passed since the bodhisattva great being Maitreya first gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. If you do so, the noble sons and daughters of the bodhisattva vehicle will, having heard about such events and this setting out, renew their exertion in order to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-061-018-34}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “the bodhisattva great being Maitreya has observed pure conduct for a long time. Noble son, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya has served the victorious ones of the past and accumulated roots of virtue. He has reached the acceptance of the profound. Noble son, I gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening for the first time eighty-four thousand eons after the bodhisattva great being Maitreya had genuinely set out on the path.”
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-061-018-35}}}“Blessed One,” said the bodhisattva great being Playfulness, {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-061-018-265,folio:F.277.b}}} “what is the name of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha in the presence of whom the bodhisattva great being Maitreya gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening? Thus-gone, worthy and perfect Buddha, please tell us about this!”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-061-018-36}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “listen carefully and keep in your heart what I will explain to you.” Receiving the full attention of the bodhisattva great being Playfulness and the entire retinue, the Blessed One began his account, “Playfulness, in the past, countless eons ago, so long ago that the amount of time cannot be measured, conceived, or fathomed, a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha appeared in the world. He was endowed with perfect knowledge and conduct. He was a bliss-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide who tames beings, a teacher of both gods and humans. This buddha, this blessed one was named Pure Golden Light. Noble son, many trillions of light rays shone from each pore of his hair. The light rays of that thus-gone one were pure like golden light, and each of them illuminated a great trichiliocosm. Each light ray filled the eastern, southern, western, northern, and intermediate directions, as well as above and below, with many trillions of lotuses. In each of these directions, many trillions of buddha fields were filled with thus-gone ones, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-061-018-266,folio:F.278.a}}} each one of them cultivating many trillions of beings to the Buddha and the Dharma and establishing them in the state of irreversibility. Noble son, the light rays of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light illuminated the world at all times. In his buddha field, the words sun and moon did not exist. Even the words heavenly bodies, planets, stars, and fire light were unknown.”
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-061-018-37}}}“Venerable One, Blessed One,” asked the bodhisattva great being Playfulness, “if this is so, how were the days and nights distinguished in that buddha field?”
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-061-018-38}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “in the buddha field of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light, the ground was made of the seven precious substances. It was smooth like the palm of the hand. Lotuses made of the seven precious substances and about the size of a chariot wheel grew out of that ground. They were beautiful, pleasant to look at, sweet smelling, fragrant, and delightful. The sweet and fragrant smell of each of these lotuses permeated a great trichiliocosm. Those who experienced these fragrances were certain to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Those lotuses blossomed in the morning and withered in the afternoon, enabling beings to know the time of day. Noble son, there was therefore a visible distinction between day and night in the buddha field of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-061-018-267,folio:F.278.b}}} Noble son, in that buddha field, even the names of the eight unfree states did not exist, and even the words suffering, hearers, and solitary buddhas were unknown. That buddha field was exclusively filled with bodhisattvas who were celibate and free from foul odors. Each assembly consisted of one thousand two hundred billion bodhisattvas. On top of these, the number of bodhisattvas who had gathered around that blessed one was uncountable. 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-061-018-39}}}“The thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light did not teach anything other than The Irreversible Wheel of the Bodhisattva Collection. What is this Dharma teaching? No phenomena whatsoever can be divorced from suchness. No phenomena whatsoever can be divorced from the sphere of reality. No phenomena whatsoever can be divorced from the limit of reality. Desire cannot be divorced from the essential nature of desire. Anger cannot be divorced from the essential nature of anger. Ignorance cannot be divorced from the essential nature of ignorance. Form cannot be divorced from the essential nature of form. Feeling, perception, karmic formations, and consciousness cannot be divorced from their essential nature. The eye cannot be divorced from the essential nature of the eye. The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mental faculties cannot be divorced from their essential nature. The essential nature is the absence of entity, and this absence of entity cannot be divorced from anything, nor can it engage in anything. Noble son, in that buddha field, {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-061-018-268,folio:F.279.a}}} the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light thus genuinely taught to the bodhisattvas the Dharma teaching called The Irreversible Wheel of the Bodhisattva Collection. 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-061-018-40}}}“At that time appeared a righteous Dharma king, a ruler of the four continents, a universal monarch named Golden Color. Noble son, for eight hundred forty million years that king Golden Color revered the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light and his great saṅgha of bodhisattvas, through all possible forms of offerings and respectful services. He honored, venerated, and worshiped them. Noble son, when the Four Great Kings, as well as Śakra, lord of the gods, and Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, together with their retinues, saw the attitude of the king Golden Color, they joined him and enthusiastically revered the blessed Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light. 
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-061-018-41}}}“Noble son, the king Golden Color created a courtyard with the length of eighty-four leagues. He draped it with silken fringes and covered it with flowers up to the knees. He adorned the space above with garlands of red pearls and fumigated it with the finest essential fragrances. Within the courtyard, he arranged for the Thus-Gone One a throne supported by legs decorated with precious substances. On that throne, he spread many trillions of cotton fabrics of inestimable value.{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-061-018-42}}} He also prepared seats of tremendous value{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-061-018-43}}} for each of the bodhisattvas. At that time, the Thus-Gone One was residing two thousand leagues away. Noble son, the king Golden Color ornamented majestically the path along these two thousand leagues to be traversed. On each side of the path, he built platforms adorned with various precious substances. He covered the path with so many flowers that they reached to the knees, and he hung canopies consisting of garlands of precious gems in the space above it. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-061-018-269,folio:F.279.b}}} On the platforms, he planted precious trees about the distance of a bowshot apart and hung strings of precious gems between each of them. Between each pair of precious trees, he built ponds surrounded by platforms made of precious gems and plastered with gold dust. The steps to these ponds were made of beryl, and the ponds themselves were filled with blue lotus flowers, pink lotus flowers, water lilies, and white lotus flowers, and with singing wild geese. Such ponds were created between each of the precious trees. 
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-061-018-44}}}“In front of each tree, he placed five hundred people carrying flower petals, five hundred people carrying vases filled with precious incense, five hundred people carrying various types of musical instruments such as great drums, clay drums, wooden kettledrums, kimpalas, lutes, and cymbals, and five hundred people carrying parasols, victory banners, and flags. Having placed in that way hundreds of people in front of each precious tree, he ordered them, ‘When the blessed Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light walks along this path, strew these flower petals and these sandalwood powders, make fumigations with these incense burners, play these cymbals, and raise up these parasols, victory banners, and flags!’ He also placed five hundred people carrying vases filled with precious flowers in front of every precious tree. Everyone remaining was also given the same role. He ordered them, ‘When the Thus-Gone One walks along this path, strew these precious flowers!’
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-061-018-46}}}“Noble son, the blessed {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-061-018-270,folio:F.280.a}}} Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light, then came out of his temple and began to walk toward that courtyard. As soon as he appeared from the temple, light began to shine from there, illuminating the bodhisattvas. Noble son, the two thousand leagues along the path were filled with bodhisattva great beings standing about one fathom away from one another. Noble son, when the Thus-Gone One walked along that path, through the power of the buddhas, white silver parasols with golden handles, covered with garlands of red pearls and surrounded by nets of small golden bells, followed the bodhisattvas in the space right above their heads, without anyone holding them. Each bodhisattva was followed by such a parasol. Shaken by the wind, the webs of small bells covering the precious parasols emitted beautiful and pleasing melodies, more delightful than the sounds of the cymbals that can produce a hundred thousand different tunes. 
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-061-018-47}}}“Through the power of that buddha, the melodies of different types of Dharma gateways were heard from the precious parasols, the small bells, the leaves of the precious trees, the strings of precious gems, the precious platforms, the cymbals, and the songs. Beings inclined toward generosity heard the melodies of generosity. Those inclined toward discipline heard the melodies of discipline. Those inclined toward patience, diligence, concentration, and insight heard the melodies of patience, diligence, concentration, and insight. Similarly, the melodies of emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonarising, and noncessation, as well as the melodies of the faculties, the powers, the branches of awakening, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-061-018-271,folio:F.280.b}}} the paths, the superknowledges, the powers, the fearlessnesses, the genuine discriminations, and the unique attributes of a buddha were heard. Those melodies manifested and were perceived in accordance with the different inclinations of sentient beings. When they heard these Dharma tunes, an uncountable number of sentient beings became certain to achieve unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-061-018-48}}}“Noble son, when the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light walked along that path, a divine precious parasol adorned with hundred thousands of precious gems rose up in the space right above his head and accompanied him along the way, without anyone holding it. Shaken by the wind, the precious parasol and its tiny bells emitted beautiful and pleasing melodies. These were the melodies of the Dharma teaching called The Seal of the Thus-Gone Ones.”
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-061-018-49}}}“Blessed One,” asked the bodhisattva great being Playfulness, “what is the Dharma teaching called The Seal of the Thus-Gone Ones that was heard from the precious parasol of the Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light? Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, please tell us about this!”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-061-018-50}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “listen carefully and keep these words in your heart. I shall but commence for you the explanation of The Seal of the Thus-Gone Ones. Noble son, all phenomena are marked by the seal of emptiness, the seal of signlessness, the seal of wishlessness, the seal of nonarising, noncessation, and nonabiding, the seal of the absence of entity, the seal of the sphere of reality, the seal of suchness, the seal of the limit of reality, {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-061-018-272,folio:F.281.a}}} the seal of how things are, the seal of nonattachment, the seal of voidness, the seal of complete liberation, the seal of the absence of characteristics, the seal of the absence of doing and going, the seal of nonapprehension, and the seal of baselessness. Noble son, all phenomena are marked by the seal of space. Noble son, for example, carving a seal out of space is not easy—there is nothing there that is a seal, and no imprint can be made. Why is it so? Because there is no basis, there are no causes and no conditions, nothing is produced, and there is no support. Noble son, similarly, a bodhisattva great being truly knows that all phenomena are similar to space, that they have the attributes of space and the essential nature of space, and that they display space. Phenomena cannot be affixed to space; they are mere imputations. As phenomena of space cannot be affixed and are mere imputations, a bodhisattva truly understands that all phenomena cannot be observed and are mere imputations. Someone who understands that all phenomena are mere imputations does not contradict suchness. Someone who does not contradict suchness understands The Seal of the Thus-Gone Ones. This is The Seal of the Thus-Gone Ones. With such an understanding, one will not be deluded about suchness.”
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-061-018-51}}}When they heard this teaching, five hundred bodhisattvas reached the acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-061-018-52}}}The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva great being Playfulness, “Noble son, when the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light, arrived in the courtyard with his saṅgha of bodhisattvas, hundreds of thousands of gods worshiped them enthusiastically by strewing {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-061-018-273,folio:F.281.b}}} blue lotus flowers, pink lotus flowers, water lilies, and white lotus flowers, scattering a rain of divine mandārava flowers, and playing a trillion cymbals. Noble son, when the Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light was staying in that courtyard, the Four Great Kings, as well as Śakra, lord of the gods, and Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, stayed in attendance to worship him, revere him, and honor him. What kinds of offerings were made to please the Thus-Gone One and his saṅgha of bodhisattvas? Each bodhisattva was attended by a white elephant decorated with all the ornaments. Staying behind them, these royal elephants held splendid and majestic precious parasols in their trunks, protecting the bodhisattvas from the wind and the sun. Necklaces of shining blue pearls dangled from their trunks. Cool drinking water resembling blue beryl and endowed with the eight qualities flowed from these pearl necklaces. Thus, the water performed its full function. As soon as the bodhisattvas took their seats, the gods caused alms bowls of precious gems to materialize in their right hands, and the gods would then hold the bodhisattvas’ alms bowls. Brahmā himself sat behind the Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light, carrying for him a precious parasol draped with pearl necklaces. Cool drinking water resembling blue beryl and endowed with the eight qualities flowed from these pearl necklaces, performing the full function of water for the Thus-Gone One. Śakra, the lord of the gods, carried the alms bowl of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-061-018-54}}}“Noble son, when the Thus-Gone One and his retinue of bodhisattvas sat down, {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-061-018-274,folio:F.282.a}}} a goddess stood in front of each of them and ground various types of divine fragrant substances into powder. During that process, a small breeze started to blow to and fro, covering the bodies of the bodhisattvas with these fragrant substances. Those holy beings were free from unpleasant odors, and since they did not even operate with the idea of goddesses or entertain the notion of perfumes, how could they become attached to any of that? That would be impossible. 
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-061-018-55}}}“Noble son, when the king Golden Color saw that the Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light had taken his seat, he was joined by one thousand boys, eighty-four thousand women, eighty-four thousand kings, eighty-four thousand householders, eighty-four thousand merchants, eighty-four thousand ministers, eighty-four thousand girls, and many other groups of people, as he personally applied himself to feeding the Thus-Gone One and the bodhisattvas to their full satisfaction, offering them plenty of the finest and most delicious foods and drinks. After they finished eating and were satiated, their plates were removed, and they concealed their hands. When the king saw this, he offered cotton fabrics of inestimable value{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-061-018-56}}} to the Thus-Gone One and cotton fabrics of tremendous value{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-061-018-57}}} to each of the bodhisattvas. Having made those offerings, the king, those great groups of beings, and all the prominent citizens joined their palms together and sat down respectfully in front of the Thus-Gone One to listen to the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-061-018-58}}}“Noble son, understanding that the great assembly of devoted people and the gathering of bodhisattvas wished for the Dharma, the Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light taught them the Dharma teaching called The Individual Gateways.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-061-018-59}}}“Blessed One,” asked the bodhisattva great being Playfulness, {{page:{number:17,id:UT22084-061-018-275,folio:F.282.b}}} “what is this Dharma teaching taught by the Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light and called The Individual Gateways of the Bodhisattvas? Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, please tell us about this! If you do so, the noble sons and daughters of the bodhisattva vehicle will also train in this Dharma teaching of The Individual Gateways.”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-061-018-60}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “listen carefully and keep these words in your heart. I shall but commence for you the explanation of the Dharma teaching of The Individual Gateways. Noble son, the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas are nothing other than the six perfections: the perfection of generosity, the perfection of discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, the perfection of concentration, and the perfection of insight. Noble son, these are the six individual gateways of the bodhisattvas. Why is it so? Because the thus-gone ones of the past have awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood by training in these six perfections. They have then turned the Dharma wheel, brought beings to maturity, and finally passed into nirvāṇa. The future thus-gone ones will also awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood by training in these individual gateways. Right now, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas residing and remaining present in an uncountable number of worlds {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-061-018-276,folio:F.283.a}}} are also turning the Dharma wheel after having awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood by training in this Dharma teaching of The Individual Gateways. 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-061-018-61}}}“Noble son, the true teaching of the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas is the true teaching of the six perfections. What are the particularities of these individual gateways? What are the faults associated with those? What is the subjugation of these faults? What is the definitive emancipation? 
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-061-018-62}}}“Miserliness is a fault for bodhisattvas. Strong clinging is a fault for bodhisattvas. Intense grasping is a fault for bodhisattvas. Guarding one’s wealth without sharing it is a fault for bodhisattvas. When bodhisattvas have subjugated and defeated their miserliness, and when they have given rise to a generous mindset, then these faults have been subjugated. Bodhisattvas who practice generosity must share their possessions, whether they are few or many, with mendicants, priests, and beggars. With an enthusiastic and joyful attitude, and without any sense of clinging or hope for reward, they must develop the charitable attitude of giving away beneficial things out of compassion for all sentient beings. Such bodhisattvas are training in the individual gateways. This is the definitive emancipation of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-061-018-63}}}“Noble son, corrupted discipline is a fault for a bodhisattva, as are damaged discipline, adulterated discipline, broken discipline, torn discipline, and polluted discipline. What is meant by ‘corrupted discipline,’ ‘damaged discipline,’ ‘adulterated discipline,’ ‘broken discipline,’ ‘torn discipline,’ and ‘polluted discipline’? A bodhisattva who develops the attitude of the hearers and the solitary buddhas {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-061-018-277,folio:F.283.b}}} or a frame of mind that adheres to concepts, who wishes for the vehicles of the hearers, the solitary buddhas, or conceptual views, and who enjoys the discourses of the hearers, the solitary buddhas, or other conceptual discourses, is said to have ‘corrupted discipline,’ ‘damaged discipline,’ ‘adulterated discipline,’ ‘broken discipline,’ ‘torn discipline,’ and ‘polluted discipline.’ Not applying or training in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas is the worst form of corrupted discipline.”
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-061-018-64}}}“Blessed One,” asked the bodhisattva great being Playfulness, “why is it that the discipline of a bodhisattva great being who transgresses the other trainings of the thus-gone ones is not considered corrupted, but a bodhisattva who develops the attitude of the hearers and the solitary buddhas, or a frame of mind that involves concepts, is said to observe the worst form of corrupted discipline?”
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-061-018-65}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “even if bodhisattvas have transgressed the other trainings of the thus-gone ones, have engaged in the four types of transgression causing downfall that I have taught, have completely taken up the path of the ten nonvirtues, or have committed the five acts of immediate retribution, if those bodhisattvas do not give up the mind set on awakening but maintain it continuously, and if they do not develop a frame of mind that involves concepts, then they are observing genuine discipline. You should understand that these bodhisattvas maintain undamaged, unadulterated, {{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-061-018-278,folio:F.284.a}}} unbroken, intact, and unpolluted discipline. They apply and train in in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas. Why is it so? Because these do not create obstacles to the bodhisattvas’ awakening. Even if such bodhisattvas have engaged in negative actions and thus generated new rebirths in cyclic existence, all such rebirths in existence will bring accomplishment of the practices of the six perfections. On the other hand, even if they train in accordance with the thus-gone ones’ trainings but adopt the attitude of the hearers and the solitary buddhas or involve concepts, the discipline of a bodhisattva will still become corrupted. Noble son, for these reasons bodhisattvas who do not give up the mind set on awakening and do not develop a frame of mind that involves concepts apply and train in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-061-018-66}}}“Noble son, furthermore, the harmful and negative attitude of ill will is a fault for a bodhisattva. The lack of equanimity toward sentient beings is a fault for a bodhisattva. Perceiving sentient beings and phenomena as being distinct is a fault for a bodhisattva. Biased, conceptually based loving kindness toward sentient beings is a fault for a bodhisattva. Nonacceptance of emptiness is a fault for a bodhisattva. Thinking ‘I will be generous to this person but not to that one’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. Thinking ‘I will make offerings to this person but not to that one’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. {{page:{number:21,id:UT22084-061-018-279,folio:F.284.b}}} Thinking ‘I will explain the Dharma to this person but not to that one’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. Thinking ‘I will revere this person but not that one’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. Judging and looking down on others’ discipline, thinking ‘This person’s discipline is pure but that one’s is corrupted’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. Why is it so? Because bodhisattvas must maintain an attitude of equanimity toward all sentient beings and all phenomena. Bodhisattvas must be impartial in the manner of the sun and the moon, or like earth, water, fire, wind, and space. They must also have acceptance of emptiness. Bodhisattvas do not abandon any sentient being. With a baseless mind that does not set up definite limits, they must be dedicated to the benefit of all sentient beings out of compassion and loving kindness. Bodhisattvas who observe such all-embracing practice, and who can also bear to think that all phenomena are empty, apply and train in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-061-018-67}}}“Furthermore, conceiving of definite limits to saṃsāra is a fault for a bodhisattva. Thinking ‘I shall circle in saṃsāra for such and such a number of eons’ or ‘For such and such an amount of eons I shall not circle in saṃsāra’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. Thinking, ‘I will liberate so and so many sentient beings’ or ‘So and so many sentient beings I will not liberate’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. Thinking ‘This is diligence, I am diligent, I shall awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood’ is a fault for a bodhisattva. How does a bodhisattva subjugate those faults? Noble son, a bodhisattva must put on the armor of diligence, thinking, ‘I have continuously circled in saṃsāra since beginningless time. {{page:{number:22,id:UT22084-061-018-280,folio:F.285.a}}} Even if, for the benefit of every single sentient being, I must continue to circle in saṃsāra for the same number of eons, I will do that happily. Likewise, for the sake of all sentient beings, I will happily continue to circle in saṃsāra until the end of time if necessary. I will give up clinging to diligence, pride, and awakening, and I will joyfully wear the armor of diligence beyond reference point.’ A bodhisattva who puts on the armor of diligence in that way applies and trains in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-061-018-68}}}“Noble son, furthermore, if bodhisattvas go to villages, cities, towns, countries, and royal palaces and, in those places, have the ability to benefit beings and are capable of handling that task, then going to those places is appropriate. On the other hand, if, while staying in solitude, they enjoy this isolation, become attached to the experience of concentration, and remain absorbed in that bliss, this is a fault for bodhisattvas. If bodhisattvas do not get tired of practicing generosity, do not rely on conceptual references, develop their qualities while resting inwardly, and are not attached to the experience of concentration but cultivate baseless concentration, they apply and train in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-061-018-69}}}“Noble son, furthermore, take the case of bodhisattvas who practice the perfection of insight and understand all phenomena to be empty of intrinsic nature, thinking, ‘Here there is no self, no sentient being, no life force, and no person at all.’ Those bodhisattvas may put effort into taming themselves and into the practice of tranquility, yet if the bodhisattvas do not speak of, point out, or use symbols to communicate this mode of emptiness and selflessness to other sentient beings caught by the mistaken habit of clinging to reference points, then understand that such bodhisattvas have no skill in means. {{page:{number:23,id:UT22084-061-018-281,folio:F.285.b}}} This is, however, not considered to be a fault. Take now the case of bodhisattvas who practice the perfection of insight and understand all phenomena to be devoid of and empty of essential nature, thinking, ‘Here there is no self, no sentient being, no life force, and no person at all.’ When those bodhisattvas have a physical experience of all these phenomena that are empty of essential nature, their minds do not fixate on any of them. On the other hand, so that sentient beings who are possessed of errors and adhere to concepts may be freed from their errors and focal points, those bodhisattvas teach them the Dharma—explaining that all phenomena are devoid of essential nature and leading them to the realization that all phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature. You should understand that bodhisattvas are skilled in means and that they apply and train in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.

When that blessed one uttered this Dharma teaching, countless sentient beings became certain to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Noble son, if I were to teach the Dharma of The Individual Gateways of the Bodhisattvas for an eon, or even longer than that, my inspiration and these Dharma gateways would never be exhausted. Nevertheless, here I have at least commenced this Dharma teaching.

Noble son, after these eight hundred forty million years had passed, on the very last day, the king Golden Color offered food and presents to the Thus-Gone One. Afterward, when he saw that the Thus-Gone One was about to depart, he wondered, ‘Should I dedicate my roots of virtue to become Śakra, to become Brahmā, or to reach the level of a universal monarch?’ The blessed Thus-Gone One Pure Golden Light knew the thought that had arisen in the mind of the king. Hence, in front of the king and those many groups of beings, the Thus-Gone One emanated in the sky an exact replica of his body, perfect in all aspects.

The eighty-four thousand kings also gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The eighty-four thousand householders, {{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-061-018-291,folio:F.290.b}}} the eighty-four thousand merchants, the boys, the girls, the wives, those great groups of beings, and eighty-four thousand sons of gods also followed the example of the king Golden Color, and all of them gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Noble son, the king Golden Color then enthroned his eldest son as king, and surrounded by ten million beings, he and the boys, girls, wives, merchants, householders, ministers, and vassal kings all faithfully renounced their households to become monastics. For ten thousand years, they all observed pure conduct. The king Golden Color developed the superknowledges, mastered extensive studies, and practiced the absorption on loving kindness. Through those roots of virtue and his superior intent, he was reborn as a universal monarch and pleased twenty thousand buddhas. He revered and honored all those buddhas, those blessed ones, by offering clothes, food, bedding, cushions, medicines, and useful appliances. Then, in front of all of them, he faithfully renounced his household to become a monastic.

Noble son, do not be skeptical; do not have any hesitation or doubts about that fact, thinking that this was someone else. Noble son, at that time, I myself was born as Śakra, the lord of the gods, and I enthusiastically revered and venerated the Blessed One Pure Golden light. {{page:{number:34,id:UT22084-061-018-292,folio:F.291.a}}} Noble son, do not be skeptical; do not have any hesitation or doubts about that fact, thinking that this was someone else.

Noble son, among all the beings who, at that time, gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening together with the king Golden Color, I have not seen a single one of them who has turned away from that unsurpassed and perfect awakening. All of them without exception possessed great insight and great diligence. They practiced the factors of awakening genuinely, and after mastering the six perfections, all of them became thus-gone ones under different names, in different buddha fields. They all appeared in the world, turned the Dharma wheel, and then passed into nirvāṇa. I, you, the bodhisattva Maitreya, and all these bodhisattva great beings who have gathered in this retinue have seen, worshiped, and revered all those thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas.

What do I mean by this? At that time such myriads of beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening under the teachings of the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light, but the Blessed One did not do so.”
{{milestone:{label:1.103,id:UT22084-061-018-135}}}“Thus it is, noble son,” replied the Blessed One. “As you said, it takes a long time to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and it is also hard to give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Noble son, I remember that before and after the time of the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Pure Golden Light, I venerated, worshiped, served, and honored myriads of buddhas. However, during all that time I never gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Thinking, ‘It is amazing how these buddhas, these blessed ones, are beautiful, pleasant to look at, and attractive,’ I merely developed attraction, delight, and respect toward them, but I did not give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Therefore, noble son, you should understand this point along these lines: although bodhisattvas may worship countless myriads of buddhas, solitary buddhas, {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-061-018-294,folio:F.292.a}}} and hearers, they may not necessarily give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening.

{{milestone:{label:1.117,id:UT22084-061-018-150}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “in the past, countless eons ago, so long ago that the amount of time cannot be measured, a thus-gone, worthy, and perfect buddha appeared in the world. He was endowed with perfect knowledge and conduct. He was a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide who tames beings, a teacher of both gods and humans. That buddha, that blessed one, was named Ratnacchatra. Noble son, when the Thus-Gone One Ratnacchatra walked seven steps just after being born, {{page:{number:38,id:UT22084-061-018-296,folio:F.293.a}}} the gods of the pure abodes held a parasol made of the seven precious substances in the sky above him. That precious parasol illuminated the entire great trichiliocosm. The Thus-Gone One Ratnacchatra received his name from these gods who proclaimed, ‘Oh! This child will be known as the Thus-Gone One Ratnacchatra!’
{{milestone:{label:1.118,id:UT22084-061-018-152}}}“At that time, there was a monk named Dṛḍhamati who had renounced life as a member of his merchant caste to become a monastic under the teachings of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Ratnacchatra. Noble son, at the time of the Thus-Gone One Ratnacchatra’s doctrine, when the monk Dṛḍhamati went begging for alms, there were in this world eighty-four thousand villages, eighty-four thousand cities, eighty-four thousand towns, eighty-four thousand countries, and eighty-four thousand marketplaces. The monk Dṛḍhamati wandered around in all those villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces to beg for alms. During his wanderings, he promised himself, ‘I will not eat any food until I establish a total of one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts.’ Noble son, with such a commitment, the monk Dṛḍhamati wandered around in those villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces to beg for alms, and he never ate any food before he had established a total of one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts. Noble son, on some occasions it took him one day to establish one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts. On other occasions it took him two days. {{page:{number:39,id:UT22084-061-018-297,folio:F.293.b}}} In the latter case, he would fast until the third day, when he would then eat again. Sometimes it took him three days to establish one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts. Noble son, sometimes it took him four, five, six, or seven days. Even if he had to fast for seven full days, he never lost courage due to his compassion for sentient beings. He would simply eat food on the eighth day. Noble son, for eighty-four thousand years the monk Dṛḍhamati followed this principle and wandered in those big towns, villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces, establishing sentient beings in the five fundamental precepts without ever loosing courage. Noble son, when those eighty-four thousand years had passed, the monk Dṛḍhamati had established thirty-six quintillion men, women, boys, and girls in the five fundamental precepts.
{{milestone:{label:1.119,id:UT22084-061-018-153}}}“Noble son, the monk Dṛḍhamati then thought, ‘I have established all those beings in the five fundamental precepts. Now, I must definitely lead them to the level of unsurpassed and perfect awakening.’ For forty-two thousand years, he proclaimed in front of them the praises of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Saṅgha, and the Great Vehicle. Among those sentient beings who had been established in the five fundamental precepts, there were three hundred million who had generated roots of virtue with the buddhas of the past and were inspired by the vast approach. Over another eighty-four thousand years he led those three hundred million {{page:{number:40,id:UT22084-061-018-298,folio:F.294.a}}} into unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The rest of them were inspired by the inferior approach, and by the power of such conditions they gave rise to the mind set on the solitary buddhas’ awakening and the vehicle of the hearers.

Noble son, the monk Dṛḍhamati gave them oral instructions to make sure they would all practice the absorption on loving kindness. Noble son, when the monk Dṛḍhamati went to a town, he would enter absorption on loving kindness. Within that absorption, he would go for alms in the villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces. The very moment he stepped onto a threshold, those beings observing loving kindness would enter absorption on loving kindness. Noble son, this was due to the special qualities of an extraordinary resolve, trust in the roots of virtue, and interest in emptiness. Therefore, whenever the monk Dṛḍhamati placed his feet on the steps of an entrance, those sentient beings entered the absorption on loving kindness, just as he had shown them. {{page:{number:41,id:UT22084-061-018-299,folio:F.294.b}}}
