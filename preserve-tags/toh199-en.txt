 Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying in Prince Jeta’s Grove at Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, along with a great congregation of monks and many bodhisattva great beings. Then, during the first watch of the night, golden light rays emerged from the Blessed One’s body and circled the Jeta Grove seven times. The light made contact with the householder Sudatta and others; then a golden light filled the sky like clouds, raining down golden flowers all over Śrāvastī. Amidst this golden light appeared an immeasurable number of hundreds of thousands of emanated thus-gone ones. They spoke in unison about the one thousand bodhisattvas to awaken in this eon, from the awakening firstly of Krakucchanda until the awakening finally of Roca. {{note:{index9,id:UT22084-061-019-24}}}{{note:{index10,id:UT22084-061-019-25}}}{{note:{index11,id:UT22084-061-019-26}}}{{note:{index12,id:UT22084-061-019-27}}}{{note:{index13,id:UT22084-061-019-28}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-061-019-29}}}After they had spoken, the light of the thus-gone ones roused an entire retinue, which gathered around them like cloud banks. The retinue consisted of Venerable Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya, who arose from absorption, with a retinue of two hundred fifty monks; Venerable Mahākāśyapa, with a retinue of two hundred fifty monks; Venerable Maudgalyāyana, with a retinue of two hundred fifty monks; Venerable Śāriputra, with a retinue of two hundred fifty monks; one thousand fully ordained nuns including Mahāprajāpatī; three thousand laymen including the householder Sudatta; two thousand laywomen including Viśākhā; the sixteen bodhisattvas of the Fortunate Eon including Samantabhadra; and five hundred bodhisattvas including the Dharma prince Mañjuśrī; as well as gods, nāgas,  yakṣas, and asuras.{{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-061-019-231,folio:F.297.a}}}{{note:{index14,id:UT22084-061-019-30}}}{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-061-019-31}}}{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-061-019-32}}}{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-061-019-33}}}{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-061-019-34}}}{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-061-019-35}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-061-019-36}}}The Blessed One then produced a thousand light rays from his tongue. Each ray of light had a thousand colors, and within each color appeared an immeasurable number of emanated thus-gone ones. All these thus-gone ones then taught in unison the profound dhāraṇīs that show the purity of all phenomena, which all great bodhisattvas possess. They included the dhāraṇī called limitless gateway, the dhāraṇī called wisdom of emptiness, the dhāraṇī called unobscured nature, and the dhāraṇī called great liberation without marks. With a single voice, they spoke billions of such dhāraṇī gateways. When they had spoken those dhāraṇī gateways, Maitreya, who was present in the retinue, attained ten trillion dhāraṇī gateways at the very instant that he heard what the Blessed One taught. He rose from his seat, adjusted his robes, joined his palms together, and then settled himself before the Blessed One. {{note:{index20,id:UT22084-061-019-37}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-061-019-38}}}

Ajita is not yet free from the body of an ordinary person, and his defilements have not yet been exhausted. He has gone forth in this life but has neither cultivated absorption nor abandoned the afflictions. Yet, the Blessed One has said that he is certain to become awakened. Therefore, when Ajita’s life is over, in which realm will he be reborn?”{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-061-019-40}}}{{note:{index23,id:UT22084-061-019-41}}}{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-061-019-42}}}

Since the Thus-Gone One is omniscient, I have prophesied that within this retinue, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Twelve years from now, he will pass away and undoubtedly take birth in the Heaven of Joy. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-061-019-232,folio:F.297.b}}}{{note:{index25,id:UT22084-061-019-44}}}

Thus, the gods have used the power of their divine merit to construct celestial palaces to worship this bodhisattva who has only one birth remaining. To do so, they first removed their robes, sandalwood jewelry, and precious crowns. They knelt, joined their palms together, and prayed: ‘With our priceless jewels and divine crowns, we wish to worship the great bodhisattva. We have heard the prophecy that Ajita will awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood not long in the future, so may our precious crowns transform into substances for the worship of his fully adorned buddha-realm!’ Each god knelt and made this prayer. {{note:{index26,id:UT22084-061-019-46}}}{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-061-019-47}}}

Each precious palace contained seven parks, each of which was made of seven precious substances. Each precious substance emitted five billion rays of light, from each of which came five billion lotuses. From each lotus emerged five billion rows of trees made of the seven precious substances. The leaves of each tree held five billion light rays in dazzling colors, and each of these dazzling colors emitted a further five billion light rays the color of Jambū river gold.  From each of these Jambū-gold light rays emerged five billion precious goddesses. Each goddess sat beneath the trees, holding in her hands five billion garlands with countless gems, and singing the loveliest songs about the Dharma wheel of the nonregressing level. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-061-019-233,folio:F.298.a}}}{{note:{index28,id:UT22084-061-019-49}}}

As all the light rays swirled clockwise, many pleasant voices could be heard teaching the Dharma of great love and great compassion. Each palace was sixty-two leagues in height and fourteen leagues in width. Five billion nāga kings encircled each palace, beautifying it from above by causing rain to fall over the five billion trees made of the seven precious substances. Natural breezes caused the trees to sway to and fro, so that they resounded with the words of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, selflessness, and all the perfections. {{note:{index29,id:UT22084-061-019-51}}}{{note:{index30,id:UT22084-061-019-52}}}{{note:{index31,id:UT22084-061-019-53}}}

Ninety million gods and five billion goddesses, born miraculously, stood among these railings. In the hands of each god were immeasurably many hundreds of millions of lotuses, each made of the seven precious substances. Above each lotus shone immeasurably many millions of lights. Inside these lights were divine musical instruments that spontaneously resounded without being played. As the music played, the goddesses rose, took hold of the musical instruments, danced, and sang lovely songs about the ten virtues, the four aspirations, and so on. All the gods who heard this generated the mind set upon unsurpassed awakening.{{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-061-019-234,folio:F.298.b}}}

The interior of each reservoir was made of five billion jewels and filled with water possessing the eight qualities that spouted up from below. Outside the four entrances were four miraculously arisen lotuses. The water that emerged around these lotuses flowed with the color of the precious blossoms. Atop each lotus were twenty-four goddesses of wondrous beauty, adorned and bearing physical marks like bodhisattvas. Five billion jeweled vessels appeared in their hands. Each vessel was filled to the brim with divine ambrosia. Draped over their left shoulders were countless garlands, and balanced against their right shoulders were countless musical instruments. Like clouds, they hovered in the sky and came forth from the water. The goddesses extolled the six perfections of the bodhisattvas. Any god born in the Heaven of Joy was naturally served by these goddesses. {{note:{index34,id:UT22084-061-019-60}}}{{note:{index35,id:UT22084-061-019-61}}}{{note:{index36,id:UT22084-061-019-62}}}

A retinue of countless hundreds of thousands of gods and goddesses brought forth a great variety of jeweled lotus flowers and scattered them over the throne.

Without being played, they spontaneously emit limitless beautiful music that pleases the minds of beings. The second king is known as Flower Scatterer. A rain of manifold flowers is released from his body, forming parasols of flowers that cover the entire palace. Each parasol has hundreds of thousands of flags and streamers that guide one along the way. The third king is known as Incense Voice. From the pores of his body, he rains down a wondrous incense of the sandalwood found at the ocean shore. The incense forms a cloud with hundreds of colors, which circles the palace seven times. The fourth great king is known as Joyous Bliss. A rain of wish-fulfilling jewels is released from his body. Each jewel naturally finds its place atop the flags and streamers, where it resounds with teachings on seeking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, as well as the five branches of discipline, countless virtuous qualities, all the perfections, and the aids to Maitreya’s awakening. The fifth great king is known as Fierce Voice. He rains down water from all the pores of his body. Five billion lotus flowers float on each water drop, and each lotus supports twenty-five crystal goddesses.

{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-061-019-119}}}The Blessed One then spoke to Upāli, “Upāli, if you have such a view, it is said to be right view. Any other view would be a wrong view.”
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-061-019-333}}}The venerable Ānanda then rose from his seat, knelt down, joined his palms, and addressed the Blessed One, “Excellent! The Blessed One has wonderfully explained Maitreya’s qualities. In the future, we shall strive to become such beings who attain the results of creating such merit. Therefore, Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma discourse? How should we retain it?”
The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, you should retain what the Thus-Gone One has taught without forgetting anything.  For the sake of future times, you shall reveal the path that leads to rebirth in the divine realms, disclose the marks of awakening, and prevent the lineage of the thus-gone ones from being interrupted. This discourse shall be known as The Nirvāṇa of the Bodhisattva Maitreya. It shall also be known as The Bodhisattva Maitreya’s Birth in the Heaven of Joy and Encouragement for the Seat of Awakening. You must retain it!”{{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-061-019-243,folio:F.303.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-061-019-122}}}When the Blessed One said this, a million bodhisattvas who had arrived from other pure lands attained the śūraṃgama absorption. Eight hundred thousand gods generated the mind set upon unsurpassed awakening. They all made the aspiration to follow Maitreya and be reborn in Jambudvīpa. {{note:{index73,id:UT22084-061-019-123}}}{{note:{index74,id:UT22084-061-019-124}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-061-019-125}}}After the Blessed One had spoken, the four retinues, as well as the eight classes of nonhuman beings—gods, nāgas, and so forth—rejoiced in what the Blessed One had said. They bowed to the Blessed One and then departed.
