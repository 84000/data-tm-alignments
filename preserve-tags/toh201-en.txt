{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-062-001-14}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in an abode of the thus-gone ones, a secluded Dharma hermitage, a luminous mansion. This mansion had amassed gatherings of ornaments of great merit. It was beyond reproach, possessed boundless qualities, and was built as solid as vajra. The indestructible ground was ornamented with flowers studded with every type of precious gem and decorated with a lattice of jewels that shone immaculately. A vast ocean of precious gems of myriad colors glimmered brilliantly; it was made up of the kings of precious gems that rained down in an unceasing shower. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-062-001-712,folio:F.2.a}}} There were rivers swirling with a variety of flowers with jeweled stems and branches. The land was arrayed with webs of every kind of flower, incense, and gemstone. Resplendent with all these adornments, this environment had been emanated by the blessings of the Buddha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-062-001-15}}}It was a vast seat of awakening, pure and adorned with an immense amount of gold and jewels in every direction. Its vast mass was adorned with beryl gemstones and encircled by a ring made of the king of precious gems. It was decorated with heaps of precious pearls, and arrayed with parasols, victory banners, flags on poles, and canopies made of a lattice of large and small bells. It was perfumed with uragasāra sandalwood, covered in precious wish-fulfilling gemstones, arrayed as a pure oceanic abode, filled with a network of luminous pillars of jewels, and overlaid with planks made of precious “lion’s mane” jewels. This mansion was adorned with vestibules made of precious “lion’s banner” jewels, architraves, and windows, and decorated with tufts of silk. There were also many scattered flowers of various types: mandārava, mahāmandārava, mañjuṣaka, mahāmañjuṣaka, roca, mahāroca, cakra, mahācakra, jasmine, agarwood, aloe, valla aloe, surabhi, dhanuṣkārika, ravishing divine blue lotus flowers, pink lotuses, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-062-001-713,folio:F.2.b}}} water lilies, and white lotuses, and other large flowers. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-062-001-16}}}On a lion throne at the center of this arrangement sat the Blessed One, unattached and with utterly pure mind. He was without duplicity in his behavior and entirely immersed in the Dharma free of characteristics. He was grounded in the way of the buddhas and had attained a level on a par with all buddhas. As he had no obscurations, he had achieved realization. He possessed the qualities of non-regression and his domain was inalienable. He rested in an inconceivable manner. He had reached the full measure of the equality of the three times. He had a body that pervaded every universe. He possessed wisdom that harbored no doubts about anything, and intelligence regarding every behavior. He had no uncertainty about awakened wisdom and possessed a non-conceptual body. He had genuinely perfected the wisdom of all bodhisattvas. He had reached the true transcendence of the non-dual way of the buddhas. He had brought to culmination the unshared liberating wisdom of the thus-gone ones. He had comprehended the equality of the state of buddhahood that is without center or periphery. He was as limitless as the realm of phenomena. He had gone to the limit of space. Through spontaneous wisdom, all of his awakened activities unfolded unceasingly. He blessed all the numerous future eons with the turning of the Dharma wheel of non-regression. He demonstrated the essential, boundless display. He possessed boundless wisdom. He never parted from, nor dwelled in, the knowledge that is supreme in every respect. He was skilled in displaying, simultaneously within all the infinite universes, the processes of dwelling in the supreme Heaven of Joy, dying and passing on, being born, departing, practicing austerities, going to the seat of awakening, vanquishing the demons, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-062-001-714,folio:F.3.a}}} fully awakening, turning the wheel of Dharma, and passing into parinirvāṇa, as well as the remaining and eventual waning of the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-062-001-17}}}Moreover, all of the assembled bodhisattva great beings, as numerous as the atoms in all the ineffably, inexpressibly many trillions of buddha realms, were sporting in the absorption of the heroic progress. They attained a form that actualized the perfection of limitless bodily hues. They were skilled in displaying the emergence of a buddha in worlds where otherwise there were none. Each one of them had purified the defiled worlds. Together with them was an unfathomable, countless number of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakras, Brahmās, world protectors, humans, and non-human beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-062-001-18}}}Then Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together he bowed toward the Blessed One and requested him, “Will the Blessed One please teach the ways of gaining inspiration, which prepares one for the first bodhisattva level?”
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-062-001-19}}}The Blessed One replied to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, “Mañjuśrī, there are five ways to gain inspiration that prepares one for the first bodhisattva level. What are the five, you may ask? They are as follows. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-062-001-20}}}“(1) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by a motivation, thereby inspiring others toward that motivation.’ In this case, motivation means to have undivided trust in specific aspects of the different roots of virtue undertaken. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-062-001-715,folio:F.3.b}}}

Such demonic activity is no different from buddha activity. Why? Because buddha activity is inseparable from the nature of demonic activity. And therefore, since there is no buddha activity apart from the nature of demonic activity, the nature of demonic activity is buddha activity.

Because form is nothing other than the absence of characteristics. Since there is no other absence of characteristics than the nature of form, the nature of form is the absence of characteristics. Thus, by knowing the nature of form to be the absence of characteristics, all phenomena are devoid of characteristics.

{{milestone:{label:1.302,id:UT22084-062-001-365}}}“(1) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by understanding the middle way, thereby inspiring others to understand the middle way.’ In this case, understanding the middle way refers to understanding purity from extremes. Why? Because the nature of extremes is nothing other than the middle way. Since the middle way is nothing other than the nature of extremes, the nature of extremes is the middle way.
{{milestone:{label:1.303,id:UT22084-062-001-366}}}“(2) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the dictum that all phenomena are permanent, thereby inspiring others with the dictum that all phenomena are permanent.’ In this case, all phenomena are permanent because there is no middle and no extremes. All phenomena have no middle or extremes because this is nothing other than the nature of conditioned phenomena. Since there is no absence of middle and extremes other than the nature of conditioned phenomena, the nature of conditioned phenomena is the absence of middle and extremes. That which is devoid of middle and extremes is permanent, stable, and eternal.

Why? Because the unconditioned is nothing other than the nature of the conditioned. Therefore, since the unconditioned is nothing other than the nature of the conditioned, the nature of the conditioned is unconditioned. By recognizing that the nature of the conditioned is unconditioned, it is known that all phenomena are unconditioned. 
{{milestone:{label:1.306,id:UT22084-062-001-369}}}“(5) One can find inspiration by thinking, ‘I will live by the fact that all phenomena are empty, thereby inducing in others the fact that all phenomena are empty.’ In this case, emptiness is a reference to views.

For instance, while space surely does not arise or cease, and has no center or periphery, we nevertheless conceptualize it as being small, medium, or vast. In this way we say, ‘This is the eye of a needle,’ ‘This is the interior of a vase,’ or ‘The sky is immeasurable.’ Nonetheless, because it is beyond arising and ceasing, space itself is not subject to any such categories. And while space surely has no thoughts or concepts, it nonetheless has unique qualities that allow it to function spontaneously and without thought.

It has equal proportions on all sides and is covered in lotus petals. On that lake there is someone speedily driving an iron chariot that has thousand-spoked wheels and is pulled by an extraordinary horse that can run faster than a garuḍa can fly. As the fast chariot rolls along its wheels do not touch the water, nor do the horse’s hooves damage the lotus petals. {{page:{number:97,id:UT22084-062-001-806,folio:F.49.b}}} Then as this chariot is speeding along, a venomous snake emerges from the great lake and in a single moment it circles the chariot ten times. Mañjuśrī, in the same amount of time that the venomous snake takes to circle the chariot once, the monk Ānanda can expound on—and cause others to understand—ten Dharma topics. In the same time that it takes the monk Ānanda to teach one Dharma topic, the monk Śāriputra is able to teach—and cause understanding of—one thousand Dharma topics. In the same time that it takes the monk Śāriputra to teach one Dharma topic, the elder Maudgalyāyana can travel beyond eighty thousand world-systems. In the same time that it takes the elder Maudgalyāyana to travel beyond one world-system, the Thus-Gone One is able to demonstrate—on every continent in all the infinite world-systems throughout the ten directions—dwelling in and descending from the Heaven of Joy, being born, departing, practicing austerities, endeavoring, going to the seat of awakening, taming the demons, fully awakening, turning the wheel of Dharma, displaying the great passing of nirvāṇa, and the persistence and eventual disappearance of the Dharma. He appears simultaneously in all his lives, including those where he practices among people living in non-Buddhist communities. Why? Because he is inseparable from unimpeded knowledge and unimpeded vision, as well as from the non-abiding state.
