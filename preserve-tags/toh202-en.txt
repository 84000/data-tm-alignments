Evaluating Whether Progress is Certain or Uncertain
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-062-002-16}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-062-002-217,folio:F.63.a}}}
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha, along with a great saṅgha of 1,250 bhikṣus. Together with them were six septillion bodhisattvas, including such bodhisattvas as Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, Avalokiteśvara, Mahāsthāmaprāpta,  Bhaiṣajyarāja, Bhaiṣajyasamudgata, and the bodhisattva King of the Sound Emanated by a Stūpa. The entire group of six septillion bodhisattvas all dwelled in the absorption of the miraculous power of certain tranquility; had attained the absorption that is like an ocean tide of deep, steady water; had attained the dhāraṇī of conferring empowerment; and had attained the dhāraṇī of achieving the limitless colors of the buddhas. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-062-002-218,folio:F.63.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-062-002-19}}}Then Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta asked the Blessed One, “How can one evaluate whether, for these bodhisattvas, it is uncertain that they will attain unsurpassable, perfect awakening, for they may turn back from the path leading to unsurpassable wisdom? And how can one evaluate whether, for those bodhisattvas, it is certain that they will attain unsurpassable, perfect awakening, and they will not turn back from the path leading to unsurpassable wisdom? Please teach the Dharma discourse that is called evaluating whether a bodhisattva’s progress is certain or uncertain, so that I will understand it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-062-002-20}}}“Mañjuśrī,” the Blessed One replied, “there are five types of progress that bodhisattvas may make. They are a bodhisattva’s progress that is like travel using a cattle cart, like travel using an elephant chariot, like travel using the moon and sun, like travel using the magical power of the śrāvakas, and like travel using the magical power of the Tathāgata. These are the five types of progress that bodhisattvas may make. Mañjuśrī, in that regard, for two types of bodhisattva it is not certain that they will reach unsurpassable, perfect awakening, while for three types of bodhisattva  it is certain that they will reach unsurpassable, perfect awakening.”{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-062-002-219,folio:F.64.a}}}{{note:{index6,id:UT22084-062-002-21}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-062-002-22}}}“Blessed One, which are the bodhisattvas who are not certain to reach unsurpassable, perfect awakening, and who will turn back from the path leading to unsurpassable wisdom?” asked Mañjuśrī. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-062-002-23}}}“Mañjuśrī,” the Blessed One answered, “they are those bodhisattvas whose progress is like travel using a cattle cart and like travel using an elephant chariot. Those are the bodhisattvas who are not certain to reach unsurpassable, perfect awakening, and who will turn back from the path leading to unsurpassable wisdom. But the bodhisattvas whose progress is like travel using the moon and sun, like travel using the magical power of the śrāvakas, and like travel using the magical power of the Tathāgata—these three are the bodhisattvas who are certain to reach unsurpassable, perfect awakening, and who will not turn back from the path leading to unsurpassable wisdom.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-062-002-24}}}“Mañjuśrī, you may wonder how one should understand bodhisattvas whose progress is like travel using a cattle cart. Mañjuśrī, they are like this: Suppose someone wished to travel across as many world systems as are equal in number to the atoms in five hundred buddhafields, and suppose that they had business, important business, an objective, an important objective, urgent affairs, or extremely urgent affairs to attend to there. They would think, ‘In what kind of vehicle shall I travel across those world systems?’ and then they might consider, ‘Well then, let me go by cattle cart. I am sure to be able to travel across those world systems that way.’ Suppose they then climbed onto their cart and set off. After they had traveled for a very long time, they might have managed to travel a hundred yojanas, but then suppose they were driven back eighty yojanas by a great cyclone.  In the best case, Mañjuśrī, what do you think? Could that person ever travel across those world systems, even if they traveled for an eon, or a hundred eons, or a thousand eons, or a trillion eons, or an inexpressible number of inexpressibly many eons? Or could they travel across even one world system?” {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-062-002-220,folio:F.64.b}}}{{note:{index7,id:UT22084-062-002-25}}}

That would be impossible!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-062-002-28}}} “Mañjuśrī, in the same way,” continued the Blessed One, “if certain sons or daughters of good family, having conceived the thought of attaining unsurpassable, perfect awakening, do not uphold or recite the Mahāyāna scriptures, but stay instead with followers of the Śrāvaka Vehicle and support, follow, and honor those followers of the Śrāvaka Vehicle; and accustoming themselves to staying with them, they apply themselves to and practice that tradition; and staying in the same gardens, monasteries, or walking places with them, they read the śrāvaka scriptures, recite them, reflect on them, and understand them, encouraging others to read them, recite them, reflect on them, and understand them—through that conditioning of having produced a root of virtue by upholding the Śrāvaka Vehicle, their discriminating wisdom would become dull, and that would make them turn back from the path leading to unsurpassable wisdom. The faculty and eye of discriminating wisdom that arise from those bodhisattvas cultivating the mind of awakening would be dulled and destroyed by the conditioning of having produced a root of virtue by upholding and maintaining the Śrāvaka Vehicle. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-062-002-221,folio:F.65.a}}}{{note:{index8,id:UT22084-062-002-29}}}

If, for the sake of restoring the eye’s ability to open and close again, the eye were examined for one month, and if after a month had passed, rather than the eye being made to open and close, instead that person’s enemy or adversary filled that eye with a handful of powdered long pepper and thus blinded that eye, just so Mañjuśrī, the faculty and eye of discriminating wisdom that arise from those bodhisattvas cultivating the mind of awakening would be dulled and destroyed by the conditioning of having produced a root of virtue by upholding and maintaining the Śrāvaka Vehicle.

And if they then attached to it a lump of iron five thousand yojanas tall, Mañjuśrī, what do you think?  Would that huge tree trunk be able to move through the ocean or be used by beings to cross it?”{{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-062-002-223,folio:F.66.a}}}
