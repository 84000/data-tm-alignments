Dependent Arising
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-062-012-8}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas! {{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-062-012-81,folio:F.125.a}}}{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-062-012-88}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-062-012-9}}}Thus did I hear at one time.  The Blessed One was in the Realm of the Thirty-Three Gods, seated on the throne of Indra. With him were great hearers such as the venerable Aśvajit; bodhisattva mahāsattvas such as noble Maitreya, noble Avalokiteśvara, and Vajrapāṇi, who were adorned with immeasurable precious qualities; as well as various gods such as the great Brahmā, who is the lord of the Sahā world, Nārāyaṇa, the great Īśvara, Śakra, who is the chief of the gods, and Pañcaśikha, who is the king of the gandharvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-062-012-10}}}On that occasion, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara rose from his seat and, having draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt down with his right knee on the peak of Mount Meru. His palms together, he then bowed toward the Blessed One and addressed to him these words: 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-062-012-11}}}“Blessed One, these gods all really wish to build a stūpa. Now that they are present in this entourage, please teach them the Dharma in such a way so that their merit of Brahmā  will increase, and the merit of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will increase much more than that of all types of beings in the world of gods, māras, and Brahmā, including renunciants and brahmins.”{{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-062-012-85,folio:F.125.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-062-012-12}}}At this, the Blessed One spoke the verses of dependent arising: 
ye dharmā hetuprabhavā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hy avadat 
teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃvādī mahā­śramaṇaḥ{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-062-012-76}}}
“All phenomena that arise from causes, 
The Tathāgata has taught their cause,
And that which is their cessation; 
Thus has proclaimed the Great Renunciant. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-062-012-13}}}“Avalokiteśvara, it is like this. This dependent arising is the dharmakāya of all the tathāgatas. A person who sees dependent arising sees the Tathāgata. Avalokiteśvara, if a faithful son or daughter of a noble family, who has built in an uninhabited place a stūpa—even one no bigger than a gooseberry fruit, with a central pillar the size of a needle and a parasol the size of a flower of the bakula tree—inserts into it this verse of dependent arising which is the dharmadhātu, he or she will generate the merit of Brahmā. When such persons pass on from here and die, they will be reborn in the world of Brahmā. When they pass on from there and die, they will be reborn with fortunes equaling those of the gods of the Pure Abodes.”{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-062-012-77}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-062-012-14}}}After the Blessed One had thus spoken, the hearers, bodhisattvas, the whole assembly, and the universe of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised his words.
