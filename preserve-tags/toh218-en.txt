Purification of Karmic Obscurations 
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-062-018-8}}}Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas! {{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-062-018-202,folio:F.284.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-062-018-9}}}Thus have I heard at one time. The Bhagavān was dwelling at Āmrapālī’s Grove in Vaiśālī, in the company of a great monastic assembly of about five hundred monks and thirty-two thousand great bodhisattva mahāsattvas, such as the bodhisattva mahāsattvas Destroyer of Pride, Sublime Knowledge Displayed with Luminosity, Like a Lotus Flower, King of Light Diffusion, Embodiment Always Appearing Like an Honorable Image, All Doubts Diminished, He Whose Intelligence is Like an Ocean of Arrayed Jewels, Abode of Myriad Flowers, King of Utterly Clear Melody, Lamp of the Light King, Golden Light of the Glorious Essence, Mighty One, Subjugator of All Places, King of Openly Proclaiming Melody, Embodiment of Enchanting Splendor, the great bodhisattva mahāsattva Youthful Mañjuśrī, and others. In all he was accompanied by thirty-two thousand great bodhisattva mahāsattvas. {{note:{index1,id:UT22084-062-018-181}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-062-018-10}}}At that time, the monk called Stainless Light came to the great city of Vaiśālī to beg for alms.  As he made his alms round, he arrived at a prostitute’s home, not knowing whose it was.{{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-062-018-203,folio:F.284.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-062-018-11}}}The moment the monk went into her home, lustful intentions were aroused in the prostitute, who thought, “I will not let this monk go without sleeping with him. If I fail, I will die.” Once the monk had come inside, she immediately shut the door and told him, “It would be wrong for you not to sleep with me. Unless you sleep with me, I will die.” 
The monk Stainless Light protested to the prostitute, “Auntie! I must train in the great precepts prescribed by the Buddha. I dare not engage in sexual activity. Please let me go! I would rather die than engage in sexual activity.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-062-018-12}}}At this the prostitute thought, “If I use a certain secret mantra and drug to seduce this monk, he will surely engage in blissful acts with me; I shall definitely use that secret mantra and drug on this monk.” But she said to him, “I, too, have no desire to destroy or impair the Buddha’s prescribed precepts. Most graciously accept my alms.”{{note:{index2,id:UT22084-062-018-182}}}
With these words she went inside, bewitched the food with magic spells and secret mantras, and poured it into the monk’s begging bowl. As soon as she had poured out his food, the monk suddenly gave rise to immoral thoughts. Fantasizing, he gave rise to enormous longing. When the prostitute noticed the change in the monk’s expression, she grabbed him with her right hand, led him to the bed, and they slept with each other. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-062-018-13}}}After the monk had had his pleasure from dallying with the prostitute, he collected his alms, went to the main temple, and thought, “Oh, woe is me! I have just violated all that is contained in the Buddha’s great teaching of moral conduct!  As I have violated my moral conduct, I am no longer worthy to partake of faithful people’s offerings. I shall fall into the great hell realms.”{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-062-018-204,folio:F.285.a}}}
He approached his monastic companions and said, “I have neglected my moral conduct. As I am no longer an ordained devotee, I shall fall into the great hell realms.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-062-018-14}}}His monastic companions asked, “Why did you neglect your moral conduct?” So he recounted to them exactly how it had happened. 
 “Venerable Stainless Light,” his monastic companions said, “the bodhisattva mahāsattva called Youthful Mañjuśrī is expert in expunging all wrongdoings. He is expert in dispelling all obscurations. He has attained patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarising. Even the Bhagavān speaks well of him, praising and extolling him. So, venerable one, please come. We shall go to meet Youthful Mañjuśrī. He will be able to dispel your distress.” {{note:{index3,id:UT22084-062-018-183}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-062-018-15}}}Then, without eating his food, the monk Stainless Light, together with his monastic companions, left for the abode of Youthful Mañjuśrī. When they entered the presence of Youthful Mañjuśrī, they exchanged some joyful and delightful conversation, and then recounted to Youthful Mañjuśrī what had happened.
After these explanations, Youthful Mañjuśrī told the monk Stainless Light, “Monk, eat some of this food. Once you have eaten, tell the Bhagavān about this and follow the Bhagavān’s instructions.”
As soon as the monk Stainless Light had eaten, he and his monastic companions, together with Youthful Mañjuśrī, left for the abode of the Bhagavān. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-062-018-16}}}Upon entering his presence, they touched their heads to the feet of the Bhagavān, and after circumambulating the Bhagavān three times, they sat down to one side of him.  The monk Stainless Light was too ashamed to be able to speak to the Bhagavān, so Youthful Mañjuśrī rose from his seat, draped his outer robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, joined his palms before the Bhagavān, and relayed to the Bhagavān everything that had happened. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-062-018-205,folio:F.285.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-062-018-17}}}When he had been told what had happened, the Bhagavān asked the monk Stainless Light, “Monk, is it true that you did thus?” 
“Bhagavān, yes, it is true,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk,” asked the Bhagavān, “did you have a prior intention to engage in lustful conduct?” 
“Bhagavān, no, I did not,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk,” asked the Bhagavān, “if lustful thoughts did not arise, how did you come to engage in lustful conduct?” 
“Bhagavān, my lustful mind arose later on,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk,” asked the Bhagavān, “did you engage in your passionate act with that mind?” 
“Bhagavān, no, I did not,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, when their minds are afflicted, sentient beings become controlled by their afflictions; when their minds are purified, they become pure. Is this not the Dharma I taught?” asked the Bhagavān. 
“Bhagavān, yes, it is,” replied Stainless Light.
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-062-018-18}}}“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “In your sleep, when dreaming, did you ever engage in passionate acts?” 
“Bhagavān, yes, I did,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk,” asked the Bhagavān, “do you not know that it is your mind that engaged in passionate conduct?” 
“Bhagavān, I do know that,” replied Stainless Light. {{note:{index4,id:UT22084-062-018-184}}}
“Monk,” asked the Bhagavān, “do you think that there is a difference such that your dreaming mind and your waking mind are separate and distinct?”{{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-062-018-206,folio:F.286.a}}}{{note:{index5,id:UT22084-062-018-185}}}
“Bhagavān, I do not see the slightest distinction between the dreaming mind and the waking mind,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Have I not taught that all phenomena are like dreams?” 
“Bhagavān, yes, you have,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Are dreams true?” 
“Bhagavān, no, they are not,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Are not the dreaming mind and the waking mind nonexistent?” 
“Bhagavān, they are indeed nonexistent. Sugata, they are indeed nonexistent,” replied Stainless Light.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-062-018-19}}}“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Could something nonexistent exist anywhere?” 
“Bhagavān, no, it could not,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Could something nonexistent arise?” 
“Bhagavān, no, it could not,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Could something nonarising arise or cease? Could it become controlled by afflictions, or cleansed?” 
“Bhagavān, no, it could not,” replied Stainless Light.
“Monk, what do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “Could nonarising phenomena go to the hell realms, or to the birthplace of an animal, or to the realm of the Lord of Death?” 
“Bhagavān, since things that are nonarising do not exist, it would be impossible for them to go to the lower realms,” replied Stainless Light.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-062-018-20}}}“Monk,” continued the Bhagavān, “while all phenomena are luminous in this way, childish ordinary beings construct unreal phenomena, construct erroneous qualities, and have constructed all phenomena, which are in fact insignificant and worthless. And thus they will go to hell, animal states of birth, and to the realm of the Lord of Death.  Monk, furthermore, all phenomena are untrue; they have the characteristic that once created they do not remain. Monk, all phenomena are compounded; childish ordinary beings have given rise to attachment, hatred, and delusion. Monk, all phenomena arise from distorted perceptions. Monk, all phenomena lack existence, their very essence is like a mirage. Monk, all phenomena lack a core, they are like space. Monk, as all phenomena are devoid of reality, they are not real entities. Monk, as all phenomena are deep like space, they are deep. Monk, as all phenomena are unperceived, they are wide open. Monk, as all phenomena are utterly void, they are nonabiding. Monk, as all phenomena have no worth for anything at all, they are unreliable. Monk, as all phenomena are without worth whatsover, they are baseless. Monk, as all phenomena are devoid of afflicted concepts, they are unfettered. Monk, as all phenomena are nonarising by nature, they are entirely free from pain. Monk, as all phenomena are void, they are unobscured. Monk, as all phenomena are free of hatred by nature, there is no hatred. Monk, as all phenomena are luminous by nature, there is no delusion. Monk, as all phenomena are like hallucinations, there is no karmic maturation. Monk, as all phenomena appear mistakenly, they are like illusions. Monk, as all phenomena are constructed falsely, they are nonabiding.{{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-062-018-207,folio:F.286.b}}}{{note:{index6,id:UT22084-062-018-186}}}{{note:{index7,id:UT22084-062-018-187}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-062-018-21}}}“Monk, as childish ordinary beings project existence onto nonexistent phenomena, they act completely blindly. Monk, as all phenomena are mutually contradictory conditions, they are nonarising. Monk, as all phenomena are without path, they are unattached. Monk, as all phenomena are not truly afflicted, they are free from afflictions.  Monk, as all phenomena are as immaculate as space, they are stainless. Monk, as phenomena are nothing but void, they are nothing whatsoever. Monk, as all phenomena are inherently nonarising, they are tamed. Monk, as all phenomena are devoid of an earlier limit, a later limit, and a middle, they are untrue. Monk, as no phenomenon is the cause of another, phenomena are liberated. Monk, as all phenomena are like grass, wood, walls, and clods of dirt, they are material substance. Monk, as all phenomena are like space, they are essenceless. Monk, as no phenomenon is anything to be attached to, phenomena are equal. Monk, as all phenomena are like a body of space and an empty hand, they cannot be grasped. Monk, as all phenomena have been the objects of thorough searches by those endowed with exalted wisdom, they are unobtained. Monk, as all phenomena are free of the three times, they are timeless. Monk, as all phenomena are nothing to be benightedly attached to, they are not to be engaged with. Monk, as all phenomena are devoid of obscurations, they are free of pain. Monk, as all phenomena are like nirvāṇa, they are blissful. Monk, as all phenomena are without fearsomeness, they are not to be feared. Monk, as all phenomena are unobserved on this side, there is no other side. Monk, as all phenomena are incalculable, they are beyond measure. Monk, as the signs of all phenomena are insignificant, they are signless. Monk, as all phenomena lack wishes, they are wishless. Monk, as all phenomena have the nature of false formations, they are without actual formation.  Monk, as all phenomena are undisturbed by discursive thought, they are unelaborated. Monk, as all phenomena are free of abiding, they are nonabiding. Monk, as all phenomena are always clear, they are unsullied. Monk, as the arising of all phenomena is unperceived, as their arising is insignificant, as their arising is worthless, as their arising is empty, and as their arising is peaceful, they are final nirvāṇa. Monk, for these reasons, these phenomena are exactly as I have taught. Monk, dwelling within the essence of enlightenment, I have not perceived even the slightest phenomenon that arises, that perishes, that is afflicted, cleansed, obscured, fettered, regretful, or miserable. Why is that so? Monk, as all phenomena are at all times unafflicted, they are perfectly pure by nature.”{{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-062-018-208,folio:F.287.a}}}{{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-062-018-209,folio:F.287.b}}}{{note:{index8,id:UT22084-062-018-188}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-062-018-22}}}When the monk Stainless Light heard this of the nature of phenomena, he felt satisfied, and rejoiced. He was very happy, and felt joy and relief. Delighted to have no obscurations, he joined his palms before the Bhagavān, bowed, and spoke these verses to the Bhagavān: 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-062-018-23}}}“Ah! Ah! Buddha powerful,

Homage to you, who are unstained and clean!

{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-062-018-29}}}“I shall suffer for inconceivable myriads of eons,
But shall not forsake the bodhi mind.

And his strengths, awakened intent does not arise.
They turn away from awakening, and strive on the hearers’ path.

On suffering, to help the worldly ones;{{note:{index9,id:UT22084-062-018-189}}}
May they seek the wisdom, true and sublime,
That is not the ground of common hearers.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-062-018-39}}}Hearing these verses of faith spoken by the monk Stainless Light, forty-two thousand sons of gods gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed, perfectly complete enlightenment. Tossing mandārava blossoms toward the Bhagavān, Youthful Mañjuśrī, and the monk Stainless Light, they proclaimed, “Monk, very good, very good. To thus pursue the enlightenment of a buddha is to reciprocate the Tathāgata’s kindness.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-062-018-40}}}At that moment the Bhagavān smiled. An attribute of bhagavān buddhas is that whenever they smile, light radiates from their mouths in myriad colors such as blue, yellow, red, white, vermillion, crystalline, and silver. Diverse colors emerged, permeated infinite limitless world systems with light, and extended up to the brahmā worlds. Outshining even the light of the sun and moon, the light then returned, circled around the Bhagavān three times, and vanished into the crown of the Bhagavān’s head. 
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-062-018-41}}}Then the venerable Ānanda rose from his seat. Draping his Dharma robe over one shoulder, he placed his right knee on the ground, faced the Bhagavān, joined his palms, and asked him,  “As the bhagavats, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas do not smile without causes and conditions, what is the cause of your smile, and what are the conditions for it?” {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-062-018-212,folio:F.289.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-062-018-42}}}“Ānanda,” replied the Bhagavān, “the monk Stainless Light has given rise to the mind set on enlightenment with noble intent. I therefore predict that the monk Stainless Light will attain unsurpassed, perfectly complete enlightenment. Ānanda, in the future, after ten eons have passed, the monk Stainless Light will make offerings to two hundred and twenty million buddhas and attain patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarising, in the presence of the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha Maitreya. He will also make offerings to all the bhagavān buddhas of the Fortunate Eon. Thereafter, having fully matured, he will become the Tathāgata He Who Proclaims the Lion’s Roar of Conduct That Is Renowned to Be the Lotus of Good Qualities. Ānanda, the buddhafield of that tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha, He Who Proclaims the Lion’s Roar of Conduct That Is Renowned to Be the Lotus of Good Qualities, will be made with seven precious attributes. There will be no hearers or solitary realizers, only bodhisattvas will gather there. Furthermore, in this buddhafield he will teach them the Dharma called ‘The Wheel of No Return.’ Also, those bodhisattvas will swiftly awaken truly and completely into unsurpassed, perfectly complete enlightenment. Thus their buddhafield will become utterly purified by the excellence of exalted wisdom, and this world system will then be called Endowed with Infinite Discourses.”{{note:{index10,id:UT22084-062-018-190}}}{{note:{index11,id:UT22084-062-018-191}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-062-018-43}}}The Bhagavān then said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, it is like this. In the same way that all darkness disappears when the sun rises, Ānanda, so, likewise, whoever hears this Dharma discourse will attain full illumination, and will also attain nonobscuration with regard to all phenomena.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-062-018-44}}}At this, the venerable Ānanda asked the Bhagavān,  “Bhagavān, how does one become obscured, and how nonobscured?” {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-062-018-213,folio:F.289.b}}}
But the Bhagavān told him, “Never mind, Ānanda! What use is it for you to ask questions on that point? Ānanda, if the tathāgata explained everything about obscuration and nonobscuration, the world and its gods would become confused.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-062-018-45}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī, however, made this plea to the Bhagavān: “Bhagavān, by hearing about obscuration and nonobscuration, the bodhisattvas of the final five hundred years will no longer give rise to desire for worldly affairs. Therefore, please do explain them!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-062-018-46}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, as for ‘obscuration,’ attachment is an obscuration, hatred is an obscuration, ignorance is an obscuration, generosity is an obscuration, moral conduct is an obscuration, patience is an obscuration, diligence is an obscuration, meditation is an obscuration, transcendent awareness is an obscuration, perceiving the Buddha is an obscuration, perceiving the Dharma is an obscuration, perceiving the Saṅgha is an obscuration, perceiving emptiness is an obscuration, perceiving signlessness is an obscuration, perceiving wishlessness is an obscuration, perceiving the actual absence of formations is an obscuration, perceiving nonarising is an obscuration, and perceiving enlightenment is an obscuration. Mañjuśrī, in brief, whether they are viewed as totally afflicted or fully cleansed, you should regard them all as obscurations.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-062-018-47}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Bhagavān, how is generosity an obscuration? How are moral conduct, patience, diligence, meditation, and transcendent awareness obscurations?” 
“Mañjuśrī,” replied the Bhagavān, “in all phenomena there is indeed no obscuration. Nevertheless, conditioned by their thoughts, childish ordinary beings engage in obscured activity with regard to generosity, and they engage in obscured activity with regard to moral conduct, patience, diligence, meditation, and transcendent awareness. How is this so? {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-062-018-214,folio:F.290.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-062-018-48}}}“Mañjuśrī, when childish ordinary beings practice generosity, they do it with disrespect toward miserly sentient beings. Due to their disrespect, those who practice giving get angry and give rise to the fault of resentfulness. The faults of anger and resentfulness plunge them into the hell realms. 
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-062-018-49}}}“When childish ordinary beings observe moral conduct they speak ill of those neglecting moral conduct, disparaging and treating them contemptuously. When these disparaging remarks are repeated to others it causes disrespect in many ordinary beings, who will go to the lower realms due to their disrespect. 
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-062-018-50}}}“When they practice patience, they declare, ‘We have patience, while those others bear harmful thoughts.’ Intoxicated with the arrogance of patience, they create all the suffering that results from fundamental heedlessness. 
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-062-018-51}}}“When they exert themselves in diligence, they extol themselves and think, ‘Those other monks are lazy and lack diligence, yet they enjoy the offerings of the faithful. They are not worthy of even enjoying water from a water container.’ As they exert themselves in diligence, they praise themselves and disparage others. I say that they are childish beings. 
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-062-018-52}}}“When they spend their time in the equilibrium of meditation, they give rise to attachment to the joyful bliss of meditation and think, ‘We spend our time in equipoise. Those other monks spend their time in mental distraction. They spend their time enjoying frivolous entertainments. As they enjoy frivolous entertainments, how will they ever become buddhas? They are far from the enlightenment of a buddha.’ Those who take attitudes like these, as long as they think such contemptuous thoughts, will cling tightly to saṃsāra for eons. Later, if they engage in enlightenment, even if they have great learning, they will imagine that, among all letterless phenomena, the mind is existent. {{note:{index12,id:UT22084-062-018-192}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-062-018-53}}}“When they observe transcendent awareness they disdain others.

{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-062-018-54}}}“If they enter the Mahāyāna, again they will think, ‘We are foremost in this world, we are the best in this world, we are supreme in this world.’ When they see followers of the Hearers’ Vehicle they give rise to disrespect, disparage them, denigrate them, and speak ill of them. Due to these evil thoughts and condemnations they will be reborn in the lower realms.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-062-018-55}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, are the bodhisattvas not praised because of the Buddha’s teachings?” 
“Mañjuśrī, what do you think?” replied the Bhagavān. “Do the bodhisattvas not regard all sentient beings affectionately? Do they not naturally give rise to altruism?” 
“Bhagavān, yes, they do,” answered Mañjuśrī.

One morning he put on his lower garment, took his begging bowl and robes, and went to the great city of Vijaya in order to beg for alms. As he walked around the city begging for alms, he came to a merchant’s home. In that merchant’s home  was the merchant’s daughter.

I will fall into the hell realms.’ He felt great physical pain, and he thought, ‘It is certain that when I die I will go to the hell realms.’ Reflecting thus, he wondered, ‘Is there anyone who can liberate me from this misery?’ He wandered from temple to temple, and would collapse to the ground like a felled tree, weeping, ‘Oh no!

He prostrated with his head to the Bhagavān’s feet, cast mandārava flowers toward the Bhagavān, and said to him, “Bhagavān, if the evil Māra deliberately tries to make this Dharma discourse decline, Bhagavān, then I shall comprehend this Dharma discourse; I shall hold it, and perfectly master it. And after you, the Bhagavān, and the venerable Ānanda have passed into parinirvāṇa, I shall cause this Dharma discourse to be practiced in Jambudvīpa. I shall command the Four Great Kings and the host of yakṣas, together with their retinues, to guard, protect, and shield this teaching. I, too, shall guard, protect, and shield those who comprehend, hold, read, and perfectly master this Dharma discourse.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.106,id:UT22084-062-018-113}}}Thereupon the Bhagavān said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, comprehend this Dharma discourse, establish it, assemble it, perfectly master it, and teach it widely to others.  Because, Ānanda, it is the Dharma mirror of all phenomena.”{{page:{number:28,id:UT22084-062-018-229,folio:F.297.b}}}{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-062-018-199}}}
 Ānanda said, “Bhagavān, just as the Tathāgata commands, I shall comprehend this Dharma discourse. Bhagavān, what is the name of this Dharma discourse? How shall it be retained?” 
The Bhagavān answered, “Ānanda, for all these reasons, retain this Dharma discourse with the name ‘Purification of Karmic Obscurations.’ Also retain it with the name ‘Entering the Unobscured Exalted Wisdom.’ ”

Eighty bodhisattvas attained patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as nonarising. When the Bhagavān had thus spoken, Youthful Mañjuśrī, the venerable Ānanda, the monks, and the worlds of gods, humans, demigods, and gandharvas rejoiced and highly praised the Bhagavān’s words. {{note:{index20,id:UT22084-062-018-200}}}
