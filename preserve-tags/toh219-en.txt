Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavat was residing with a great saṅgha of one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikṣus and seventy thousand bodhisattvas in Śrāvastī, in Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park.

{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-062-019-94}}}After Venerable Śāriputra had asked that, the Bhagavat said these words to him: “Śāriputra, a noble son or noble daughter who has entered the Śrāvakayāna, or has entered the Pratyekabuddhayāna, or has entered the Mahāyāna, or any other being who wishes for the highest most complete enlightenment of buddhahood, should three times each day and three times each night, with the upper robe over one shoulder, kneel on the right knee, place their palms together in homage, and say these words:

With malicious intent, I have caused a tathāgata to bleed, I have forsaken the Dharma, I have caused a division of the Saṅgha, I have slain a bhikṣu arhat, I have slain my parents, and I have followed the path of the ten bad actions—the three physical, the four verbal, and the three mental. I have made others commit them, I have rejoiced in their accomplishment, and I have spoken harshly to certain beings. I have maligned. I have cheated with weights. I have cheated with measures. I have made my parents unhappy. I have stolen the wealth of individuals, of stūpas, of saṅghas, and of the saṅghas of bhikṣus in the four directions. I have transgressed the vinaya and the foundations of the training. I have disobeyed the upādhyāyas and the ācāryas. I have been unpleasant to those who have entered the Śrāvakayāna, entered the Pratyekabuddhayāna, entered the Mahāyāna, and every other being—I have reviled and beaten them with a mind that is obstinate, angry, envious, and miserly. I have spoken harsh words to buddha bhagavats, have said that the sublime Dharma is not the Dharma, and have said that that which is not the Dharma is the sublime Dharma.
