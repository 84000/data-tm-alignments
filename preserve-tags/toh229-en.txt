Discussions of Thus-Gone Ones
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-063-010-18}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-063-010-647,folio:F.226.b}}}
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Śrāvastī in the Jeta Grove, the park of Anāthapiṇḍada, together with a great monastic assembly of one thousand two hundred fifty monks. At that time, the Thus-Gone One remained in meditative seclusion for three months, sustained by a single alms meal. When those three months had elapsed, youthful Mañjuśrī went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. Venerable Śāriputra also went to the Blessed One when those three months had elapsed, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. In the same way, everyone else among the one thousand two hundred fifty hearers—including the elders venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, venerable Mahākāśyapa, venerable Mahākātyāyana, venerable Mahākauṣṭhila, venerable Kapphiṇa, venerable Amogharāja, venerable Subhūti, venerable Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, venerable Upāli, venerable Revata, venerable Kālodāyin, venerable Ānanda, venerable Yaśodeva, venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, venerable Śroṇakoṭīviṃśa, and venerable Rāhula—all went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. Moreover, a total of five thousand bodhisattvas—including the noble sons Bhadrapāla, Ratnasambhava, Guṇagupta,  Holder of the Swords, Naradatta, Varuṇa, Indradatta, Giving Faith, and Naradatta—all went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. Śakra, king of the gods, together with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, also went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. The gods Santuṣita, Śrībhadra, and Nirmāṇa also went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. Brahmā, the lord of the Sahā universe, together with many thousands of gods, also went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. The gods Īśvara, Maheśvara, and Praśāntavinīteśvara, along with many thousands of divine beings from the pure realms, also went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. Moreover, the gods Sūrya and Candra also went to the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-063-010-648,folio:F.227.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-063-010-22}}}At that point youthful Mañjuśrī rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, and knelt with his right knee on the ground. With his palms joined, he bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, “Blessed One, how did you spend the last three months? The faculties of the Blessed One are so clear,  your face is so pure, and your complexion is so bright!”{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-063-010-649,folio:F.227.b}}}
The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī, I have spent three months having discussions about buddhas. Mañjuśrī, I have spent three months having discussions about thus-gone ones and having discussions about the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-063-010-24}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Blessed One, how were your discussions about buddhas, discussions about thus-gone ones, and discussions about the Dharma? Blessed One, what was the essence of those discussions about buddhas, thus-gone ones, and the Dharma? Blessed One, it would be excellent if you would share the discussions between yourself and the thus-gone ones with us, if we are suitable recipients.”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-063-010-25}}}The Blessed One gave his approval to youthful Mañjuśrī, saying, “Mañjuśrī, excellent, excellent! Mañjuśrī, it is excellent that you thought to ask the Thus-Gone One about the essence of my discussions with the thus-gone ones. Mañjuśrī, you have served the victorious ones of the past and generated roots of virtue with many hundreds of thousands of buddhas. Even though you already served many hundreds of thousands of buddhas, Mañjuśrī, it is because of the strength of these noble sons and daughters that you now speak about those Dharma discussions. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-063-010-26}}}“Mañjuśrī, those individuals who encounter this teaching on the discussions about buddhas, discussions about thus-gone ones, and discussions about the Dharma will not encounter the wicked Māra. Mañjuśrī, those noble sons and daughters who encounter this teaching on the discussions about buddhas, thus-gone ones, and the Dharma will behold the Thus-Gone One before them.  You should know that I will also see them. Mañjuśrī, I will see those noble sons and daughters who encounter this teaching on the discussions about buddhas, discussions about thus-gone ones, and discussions about the Dharma, and I will see those who reject it as well.{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-063-010-650,folio:F.228.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-063-010-27}}}“Mañjuśrī, those noble sons and daughters who do not reject this teaching will be faithful, trusting, sincere, and honest, and they will have perfect behavior and motivation. Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, those noble sons and daughters will develop discipline. They will not be lazy, covetous, or malicious. They will not be careless or stingy. Mañjuśrī, such noble sons and daughters will develop discipline. They will be free of laziness, covetousness, malice, and stinginess. They will develop mindfulness, intelligence, and understanding. They will have perfect modesty, they will act diligently, and their trust will be great.”
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-063-010-28}}}To that Mañjuśrī replied, “Blessed One, in that case, now is the time for the Blessed One to teach and explain the absorption of the teaching on the discussions about buddhas, discussions about thus-gone ones, and discussions about the Dharma, right here before the gods, humans, and asuras—here before the whole world including its gods. Well-Gone One, the time has come for it. When we have heard it from the Blessed One, we will remember what you say.” {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-063-010-651,folio:F.228.b}}}
The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī, for that reason, listen carefully and pay attention. I shall now explain.”
Youthful Mañjuśrī replied, “Very well, Blessed One,” and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-063-010-31}}}The Blessed One continued, “Mañjuśrī, to the east, beyond one thousand buddha fields, is the world known as Abhirati. There, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Akṣobhya resides, flourishes, prospers, and teaches Dharma. Mañjuśrī, there I asked the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Akṣobhya, ‘On what basis did the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Akṣobhya fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone Akṣobhya replied to me, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the basis of childish, ordinary beings’ perception of a self.’ Mañjuśrī, I then asked the thus-gone Akṣobhya, ‘What is the basis for childish, ordinary beings’ perception of a self?’ He replied to me, ‘Since it is based on ignorance, childish, ordinary beings’ perception of a self is baseless. It is on such a basis that I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.’ Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone Akṣobhya then asked me, ‘On what basis did the greatest of the Śākya kings, Śākyamuni, fully awaken to  unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ Mañjuśrī, I then replied to the thus-gone Akṣobhya, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on the manifestation of the sixty-two convictions that childish, ordinary beings maintain.’ Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone Akṣobhya asked me, ‘On what basis do the sixty-two convictions of childish, ordinary beings manifest?’ Mañjuśrī, I replied to the thus-gone Akṣobhya, ‘The sixty-two convictions of childish, ordinary beings manifest based on fully engaging in the phenomena of the mind and mental factors that are the basis of illusory beings. I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on that same basis.’ Such were the questions in the discussion we had by means of the mind.{{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-063-010-652,folio:F.229.a}}}{{note:{index5,id:UT22084-063-010-32}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-063-010-33}}}“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, in the eastern direction, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Well Protected asked me, ‘On what basis did the Thus-Gone One, the greatest of the Śākya kings, Śākyamuni, fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ Mañjuśrī, I said to the Thus-Gone One, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on the manifestation of desire, aversion, and delusion, which form the basis for childish, ordinary, ordinary beings.’ Mañjuśrī, the Thus-Gone One then asked me, ‘On what basis do the desire, aversion, and delusion of childish, ordinary beings manifest?’  Mañjuśrī, I replied to the Thus-Gone One, ‘The desire, aversion, and delusion of childish, ordinary beings manifest on the basis of the realm of the inconceivable.’ ”{{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-063-010-653,folio:F.229.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-063-010-34}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, why is it that the realm of the inconceivable is inconceivable”?
The Blessed One said, “Mañjuśrī, it is based on the absence of a basis known as baseless that the desire, aversion, and delusion of childish, ordinary beings manifest. {{note:{index6,id:UT22084-063-010-777}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-063-010-36}}}“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, I asked the thus-gone Well Protected, ‘On what basis did the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Well Protected fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ The Thus-Gone One told me, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on the manifestation of the acts of immediate consequence of childish, ordinary beings.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-063-010-37}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Blessed One, “On what basis do the acts of immediate consequence of childish, ordinary beings manifest?”
The Thus-Gone One said, “Mañjuśrī, the acts of immediate consequence of childish, ordinary beings manifest on the basis of nonexistence. Mañjuśrī, it is like this: when sleeping, a person may dream that they grab a poisonous snake, get bitten, and die there. Due to the pain of their brush with death and the agony of dying, the person may then awaken. However, as soon as they awaken, they will understand that painful experience to be nonexistent.  In that case, tell me, Mañjuśrī—was that person bitten by a poisonous snake?”{{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-063-010-654,folio:F.230.a}}}
“No, Blessed One, they were not.”
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-063-010-40}}}“Tell me, Mañjuśrī—since they were not bitten, did they suffer?”
“No, Blessed One, they did not. Why is that? Blessed One, just as that poisonous snake did not exist, the one who was bitten also did not exist. Therefore, how could their agony and experience exist?”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-063-010-42}}}“In the same way, Mañjuśrī, all phenomena are devoid of a basis. Just as all phenomena are devoid of a basis, so are the bite and the agony. Just as that agony is, so too is the poisonous snake. Just as the poisonous snake is, so too are all phenomena. Just as all phenomena are, so too are the acts of immediate consequence. Just as the acts of immediate consequence are, so too is awakening. Just as awakening is, so too is any basis. It is on such a basis that I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. Such were the questions in the discussion we had by means of the mind.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-063-010-43}}}“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, in the east, I asked the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Sumerukalpa, ‘On what basis did the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Sumerukalpa fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone Sumerukalpa replied, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on the limits of the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the wind element, and the space element.’  Mañjuśrī, thus-gone Sumerukalpa continued, ‘On what basis did the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, the greatest of the Śākya kings, Śākyamuni, fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ I replied, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the same basis from which the thus-gone Sumerukalpa teaches the six classes of beings.’ Such were the questions in the discussion we had by means of the mind.”{{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-063-010-655,folio:F.230.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-063-010-44}}}“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, in the east, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Samantakusuma resides, flourishes, prospers, and teaches Dharma. I asked him, ‘On what basis did the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Samantakusuma fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood? Furthermore, how was this buddha field manifested?’ Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Samantakusuma replied, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the basis of the first arousal of the intention to attain awakening. This buddha field was manifested in the same way that illusory beings have manifested the eight liberations.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-063-010-45}}}Then youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how did the thus-gone Samantakusuma fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the basis of the first arousal of the intention to attain awakening?”
The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī, that arousal of the intention to attain awakening is unarisen, and it is also not arising now.  So, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Samantakusuma fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the basis of the first arousal of the intention to attain awakening, which is like that. Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone Samantakusuma asked me, ‘On what basis did the Thus-Gone One, the greatest of the Śākya kings, Śākyamuni, fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ Mañjuśrī, I replied to that thus-gone one that I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the basis upon which all desires are known. Such were the questions in the discussion we had by means of the mind.{{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-063-010-656,folio:F.231.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-063-010-47}}}“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, in the east, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Transcendent Over All Misery resides, flourishes, prospers, and teaches Dharma. I asked him, ‘On what basis did the thus-gone Transcendent Over All Misery fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ The Thus-Gone One told me, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on that which is the basis for the manifestation of existence for childish, ordinary beings.’ Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone Transcendent Over All Misery asked me, ‘On what basis did the Thus-Gone One, the greatest of the Śākya kings, Śākyamuni, fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’ I replied, ‘I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood based on that which is the basis for the indiscernible beginning of all beings as they rotate through saṃsāra.’ ” {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-063-010-657,folio:F.231.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-063-010-48}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Blessed One, “What is the basis for the indiscernible beginning of all beings as they rotate through saṃsāra?”
The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī, it is upon ignorance that the indiscernible beginning of all childish, ordinary beings is based.”
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-063-010-50}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Blessed One, why is the beginning indiscernible?”
The Blessed One replied, “It is like this, Mañjuśrī: all phenomena lack substance. I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood on the basis of that lack of substance.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-063-010-52}}}Mañjuśrī asked, “Thus-Gone One, based on what absorption did you discuss these topics?”
The Blessed One responded, “Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones discuss these topics by abiding in the inconceivable and stainless absorption of the completely pure seal. Mañjuśrī, even if there is not a single embodied buddha present, if one rests in that absorption, several embodied buddhas will appear. Mañjuśrī, even if there is not a single buddha field present, if one rests in that absorption, a variety of buddha fields will appear. Mañjuśrī, even if there is not a single hearer present, if one rests in that absorption, a variety of hearers will appear. Mañjuśrī, even if there is absolutely no buddha speech in existence, if one rests in that absorption, a variety of buddha speech will resound. Mañjuśrī, even if there is not a single piece of knowledge present, if one rests in that absorption, a variety of things will be known. Mañjuśrī, even if there is not a single being present, if one rests in that absorption, many beings will be liberated.”
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-063-010-54}}}Mañjuśrī said, “Blessed One, how wonderful! This absorption is so vast!  Blessed One, how wonderful—this absorption is inconceivable! Blessed One, how wonderful—this absorption is unobstructed! Blessed One, how wonderful—this absorption is difficult to comprehend! Blessed One, how wonderful—this absorption is profound! Blessed One, how wonderful—this absorption is transcendent!”{{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-063-010-658,folio:F.232.a}}}
The Blessed One responded, “Mañjuśrī, it is like that; it is just as you have said. Mañjuśrī, this absorption is vast. Mañjuśrī, this absorption is inconceivable. Mañjuśrī, this absorption is unobstructed. Mañjuśrī, this absorption is difficult to comprehend. Mañjuśrī, this absorption is profound. Mañjuśrī, this absorption is transcendent. 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-063-010-56}}}“Mañjuśrī, because of resting in this absorption, I do not go from this buddha field to any other buddha field in order to ask questions to those blessed buddhas. Likewise, those blessed buddhas do not have to come to me. I ask them questions, and they, likewise, ask me questions. Furthermore, while abiding in this world, I can ask questions to those blessed buddhas who abide in the various other worlds. Likewise, those blessed buddhas who abide in various other worlds can ask me questions while I abide here. Mañjuśrī, while abiding in this absorption, my voice can be understood in all buddha fields, and that sound reaches those blessed buddhas without interference. Mañjuśrī, while abiding in this absorption, the voices of those blessed buddhas can also be understood in all buddha fields, and they reach me without interference. Mañjuśrī, while abiding in this absorption, I can also respond to those blessed buddhas, and while they abide in this absorption they can respond to me. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-063-010-659,folio:F.232.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-063-010-57}}}“Mañjuśrī, it is like this analogy: A person might leave from here and go to a large and great city where people are having conversations. As people are talking to each other, echoing sounds can be heard. Tell me, Mañjuśrī—will one such echo communicate with another echo? Or will the former echo be understood by the subsequent echoes? Or will they mutually hear or know each other?”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-063-010-58}}}Mañjuśrī responded, “Blessed One, the subsequent echo will not hear or know the sound of the earlier echo. Why is that? Blessed One, it is because echoes do not have conscious awareness. Not having conscious awareness is a topic for discussion by means of the mind.”{{note:{index7,id:UT22084-063-010-59}}}{{note:{index8,id:UT22084-063-010-60}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-063-010-63}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, where does the so-called ‘nature of beings’ reside?”
The Blessed One responded to youthful Mañjuśrī, “Mañjuśrī, I will give an analogy so that you can understand this. Some others will also understand the meaning of this analogy.  Mañjuśrī, it is like this analogy: If a magician or a magician’s skilled apprentice conjures a host of elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, and human forms that move back and forth, or if he displays an army of the four kinds of troops, what do you think about that, Mañjuśrī? Is that army of the four kinds of troops present somewhere? As that army is displayed, does something appear there?”{{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-063-010-661,folio:F.233.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-063-010-65}}}Mañjuśrī replied, “No, Blessed One. If that army is completely nonexistent, how could it manifest, be present, or appear in actuality?”
“Likewise, Mañjuśrī, if beings or those labeled as beings are utterly nonexistent, how could they be present? How could they appear in actuality? Mañjuśrī, it is on such a basis that I fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. Such were the questions in the discussion we had by means of the mind.”{{note:{index9,id:UT22084-063-010-67}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-063-010-68}}}When this teaching was given, sixty thousand gods of the desire realm and form realm attained the purified Dharma eye, free from dust and blemish. Three million two hundred thousand brahmins with excessive pride developed a mind free from excessive pride. Four hundred thousand gods developed acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. 
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-063-010-69}}}At this point the Blessed One smiled. As is the case whenever blessed buddhas smile, a variegated array of blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystal, and silver-colored rays of light emanated from his mouth and filled infinite, limitless world systems with light. After traveling as far as the abode of Brahmā, the light rays returned, circled the Blessed One three times, and disappeared into the crown of his head.  As soon as the Blessed One smiled, all the world systems of the great trichiliocosm were illuminated and filled with bright light.{{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-063-010-662,folio:F.234.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-063-010-70}}}Youthful Mañjuśrī then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed buddhas do not smile without cause or reason. Therefore, what is the cause for the Blessed One’s smile just now? What is the reason?”
The Blessed One responded, “When I gave that teaching, sixty thousand gods of the desire realm and form realm attained the purified Dharma eye, free from dust and blemish. Three million two hundred thousand brahmins with excessive pride developed a mind free from excessive pride. Four hundred thousand gods developed acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. When thirty-two thousand of those gods die and transmigrate from their divine realms, they will be reborn in the buddha field of the thus-gone Akṣobhya. From that buddha field they will also travel to other buddha fields. Accomplishing unexcelled and perfect buddhahood after limitlessly and immeasurably many eons, they will fully awaken to buddhahood and all become known as the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Samantaprabha. The buddha fields of those fully awakened buddhas will become filled with light. Just as the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three are always adorned with beautiful things, so will the worlds where these beings attain awakening always be adorned. Mañjuśrī, that is the cause for my smile. That is the reason.

Mañjuśrī, in this very place within space, the thus-gone Maitreya will also deliver this Dharma teaching on the discussions about buddhas, discussions about thus-gone ones, and discussions about the Dharma. Mañjuśrī, spoken by the Buddha means truthful speech.

Great king, the more you engage with them, the more you do not conceive of them as phenomena. Great king, that which is called not conceiving of phenomena is the source of ignorance. If you observe conceptualization, it becomes nonconceptualization. Great king, if conceptualization is transformed, it becomes nonconceptualization. Great king, conceptualization is a symbolic designation. Great king, conceptualization is attachment. Great king, if there is conceptualization, it is called childishness. Great king, childishness perpetuates childishness.  Why is it called perpetuating childishness? Because it perpetuates childishness. How is it perpetuated? It perpetuates conceptualization. What is that conceptualization? It is the perpetuation of the concept of a self, the concept of existence, the concept of a being, and everything from the concept of form up to the concept of consciousness. It is the perpetuation of everything from the concept of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and the mind up to all concepts, even as far as the concept of nirvāṇa. Great king, why is nirvāṇa called nirvāṇa? Because it is a conceptualization of nirvāṇa.{{page:{number:32,id:UT22084-063-010-678,folio:F.242.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.99,id:UT22084-063-010-167}}}“Great king, the concept of nirvāṇa does not exist. Great king, for childish, ordinary beings, nirvāṇa is enacted in the manner of a wheel or a river eddy. Great king, why is the term ‘manner’ used? Because it is not within the realm of experience. It cannot be the experience of anyone anywhere. Since it is not the experience of anyone, it is not in the realm of conceptualization. Great king, why is it called the realm of experience? Because it conceals that mind, that great experience, and that inauthentic experience. What is inauthentic? Anything that is not real is inauthentic. Nonexistent things are all inauthentic, which is why they are called nonexistent. Great king, why are nonexistent things called nonexistent? Because, great king, they lack substance. Why do inauthentic things lack substance? Because inauthentic things are impermanent, because they are painful, because they lack a self, and because they are an impure reality. Anything that is not true is inauthentic. {{note:{index12,id:UT22084-063-010-168}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.100,id:UT22084-063-010-169}}}“Likewise, great king, conceptualization is mistaken. Why is it called mistaken?  Because, great king, what is mistaken is neither here, nor there, nor anywhere in between. Hence, great king, how could there be any conceptualization? What is conceptualization? It is the conceptualization of impermanence, suffering, selflessness, and ugliness. Great king, why is there no conceptualization here, there, or in between? Consider how the conceptualization of impermanence is just the same as the conceptualization of permanence!{{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-063-010-679,folio:F.242.b}}}

Great king, if there is no in-between, then one cannot determine the middle. How, then, could one determine the edge? Great king, where one cannot observe the middle, one cannot observe the edge. If one cannot determine the edge, one has also eliminated movement. Where movement is eliminated, no one can go. If no one can go, then no one will proceed. If no one can proceed, there can be no rebirth. Where there is no rebirth, the only continuation is the abode of awakening. The abode of awakening is devoid of grasping. Being devoid of grasping is called a sentient being. That is why bodhisattvas are known as supreme sentient beings. Therefore, bodhisattvas are without grasping. Why is it called devoid of grasping? It is known as devoid of grasping because there is no grasping at observations. Great king, that is the supreme teaching. In this way, I teach the profound Dharma and give explanations. 
{{milestone:{label:1.102,id:UT22084-063-010-171}}}“In this way, phenomena are uncreated, unchanging, and unceasing; they are empty of essential nature. Great king, as for ‘essential nature,’ why do we speak of being empty of essential nature? It is because all phenomena lack intrinsic substance that they are said to be empty of essential nature. Great king, why is that Dharma known as profound? Because, great king, it leads to the stable states. Great king, what are those stable states? They are states in which bodhisattva great beings engage.  What is meant by engage? Engaging with all phenomena as being empty—whoever engages with emptiness understands that. That is why it is said that all phenomena are emptiness. {{page:{number:34,id:UT22084-063-010-680,folio:F.243.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.103,id:UT22084-063-010-172}}}“As for saying that all phenomena are inconceivable, it means that they are devoid of characteristics. Great king, why are they devoid of characteristics? Great king, all phenomena are selfless. What is selfless cannot be demonstrated. What cannot be demonstrated cannot be disturbed. What cannot be disturbed is grounded. What is grounded is unestablished. What is unestablished will not be squandered. What will not be squandered is known as all phenomena’s abiding realm of phenomena. 
{{milestone:{label:1.104,id:UT22084-063-010-173}}}“Great king why is the abiding realm of phenomena known as abiding phenomena? Great king, phenomena do not abide. That ‘nonabiding’ has been unobservable since the very beginning, and even the beginning is unobservable. What is without an observable basis is also without observable going or coming. What is without an observable becoming is known as the space of emptiness. Great king, why is that space unobservable? If a space is observed within a space, it becomes the space itself. Great king, in that way, childish, ordinary beings will run toward liberation. Great king, why is it called liberation? Liberation is inexhaustible. Those who run toward the inexhaustible will become exhausted. Those who are exhausted will become utterly exhausted. Those who become utterly exhausted are weakened. How are they weakened? They are weakened with respect to the true nature. Those who are weakened are distant from the gateways to liberation. Great king, why are they called gateways? They are gateways because they are well disposed toward two sides. Great king, this use of the term gateway of liberation is a symbolic expression.  Great king, why is it called a symbolic expression? Because in this there is nothing whatsoever to express and nothing to understand. Where there is nothing to be understood, there is also nothing to cognize.{{page:{number:35,id:UT22084-063-010-681,folio:F.243.b}}}

They accept and reject where there is nothing to accept and nothing to reject. Those who reject are running. Where are they running to? They are running toward awakening. They are running toward emptiness. Those who are running are distant from this teaching and far from being near to awakening. Great king, why is it called being near? It is neither near to awakening nor not near to it. What is awakened is not established anywhere. Therefore, it is not known as either peace or nonpeace. Great king, why are those who are at peace and awakened called awakened? Because they are lions. What is a ‘lion’? It is to be unafraid. Why are they said to be unafraid? Because, great king, they have transcended fear. Great king, with regard to those who are unafraid, why are thus-gone ones called thus-gone ones? Thus-gone ones are called thus-gone ones because they come and go. Great king, why else are they called thus-gone ones? Because they have not gone, nor have they not gone. That is why they are called thus-gone ones. Great king, why are discussions about buddhas known as discussions about buddhas and discussions about thus-gone ones? Because buddhas understand that all phenomena are unmoving. How do they understand that? They understand it in the same way they understand that there is no coming and no going.”

Great king, it is like this analogy: Imagine that in the presence of a group of people a magician or a magician’s skilled apprentice conjures up two kings with armies of the four kinds of troops, fully prepared and armored, who are assembled to fight a battle. Great king, one of those two kings conjured by the magician is then defeated, and the other king, after that conjured battle has been fought, emerges victorious.

This Dharma is the very absence of flaws. In this regard, the thus-gone ones speak the truth. They speak just as it is. They speak correctly. They speak incontrovertibly. They apply terms in accordance with the unborn nature of all phenomena. Great king, in accordance with the way in which childish, ordinary beings apprehend, the thus-gone ones teach what cannot be demonstrated. Great king, the thus-gone ones completely eliminate all conventions. Why do thus-gone ones completely eliminate all conventions? Because all conventions are equal. It is said that what is equal is eliminated, and what is eliminated is equal. The complete elimination of all conventions is the unborn nature of phenomena.

Moreover, great king, even though one syllable can produce many other syllables, those syllables do not appear in that one syllable. Moreover, great king, for a monk who has great miraculous powers, one can be transformed into many, and many can become one. In the same way, great king, when the thus-gone ones have obtained the powers, fearlessnesses, and all the perfections, they teach the Dharma in order to instruct beings. As they do so, they employ worldly conventions and ways of calculation to declare ‘I have trained such-and-such many beings.’ However, great king, the method of training, those who are trained, and those who do the training are actually nondual from the perspective of the thus-gone ones.

Pūrṇa, this is neither a ‘natural way’ nor an ‘unnatural way.’ Therefore, it is called a natural way. Pūrṇa, these are the essential words. Pūrṇa, why are the essential words called the essential words? Pūrṇa, it is because, for example, they are like the literal meaning of the liberations.

Pūrṇa, as far as manifesting action and ripening, what is action? What is ripening? Pūrṇa, actions may be white, black, and those that are neither white nor black. Ripening is abandonment. That is how it manifests. All phenomena are indivisible, and that is why it is known as correct knowledge. Why is it called correct knowledge? Because it is correct knowledge of meaning.

That is how they manifest. In order for ripening to occur, actions appear to be generated. That generation is manufactured and produced. Why is it said to be ‘produced’? Because suffering is produced. What is suffering? It is craving and views. What is attachment to views? Even though there is no going and no abiding, childish, ordinary beings become attached to views—even though there are no views—and so they rush forth. Those beings who rush forth become immersed. Those who become immersed deteriorate. Those who deteriorate become immersed. Those who become immersed cause arguments. Why do they cause arguments?

The Blessed One said, “Mañjuśrī, there is no realm in the realm of phenomena. Mañjuśrī, it is from that perspective that I use the phrase realm of phenomena. Mañjuśrī, departure from all phenomena refers, Mañjuśrī, to the fact that all phenomena have been emancipated from the elements.”

This absorption is not shared by solitary buddhas. Blessed One, this absorption is not even shared by those who profess the teachings of the buddhas. Therefore, Blessed One, there is no possession or nonpossession of this absorption. Why is that? Blessed One, it is because any phenomena that one encounters, as well as those one does not encounter, are nonexistent. Whenever there is a phenomenon, it is like this. Hence, what does not exist in any way is not something that one can either encounter or not encounter. Therefore, Blessed One, this absorption is uncommon.{{page:{number:66,id:UT22084-063-010-712,folio:F.259.a}}}

“Furthermore, Blessed One, this absorption cannot be attained by anyone at all. Why is that? Blessed One, it is because the accumulation of sameness does not exist. Blessed One, it is because the sameness of all phenomena is not observable.
“Furthermore, Blessed One, this absorption is shared in the same way that all beings are shared. This absorption is also inalienable in the same way that all beings are inalienable. 
“Furthermore, Blessed One, that absorption that is disengaged from beings is common to all beings.  Why is that? Blessed One, disengagement itself is absorption. {{page:{number:67,id:UT22084-063-010-713,folio:F.259.b}}}
“Furthermore, Blessed One, this absorption is inconceivable. Why is that? Because it is beyond the realm of mind. This absorption is inconceivable.

Heart of the Glorious Lotus said, “Venerable Śāriputra, if I truly saw any qualities of the buddhas, then the qualities of the buddhas would have become substantive things. However, venerable Śāriputra, no phenomenon is substantive. Venerable Śāriputra, if the qualities of the buddhas existed, they would also be understood as something other than the qualities of the buddhas. The qualities of the buddhas would become a product of the mind.”
The Blessed One praised youthful Heart of the Glorious Lotus saying, “Excellent!” {{page:{number:69,id:UT22084-063-010-715,folio:F.260.b}}}

“Venerable Śāriputra, I do not. Why is that? Venerable Śāriputra, if I did, that awakening would involve clinging to a self. Venerable Śāriputra, that being so, why would I think, ‘I will fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood’?”

Venerable Śāriputra said, “Heart of the Glorious Lotus, what actions do you engage in?”
{{milestone:{label:1.218,id:UT22084-063-010-365}}}At that moment youthful Heart of the Glorious Lotus produced miraculous displays.  When he produced those miraculous displays, the entire retinue became suffused with rays of light, and then he himself disappeared.

“Youthful one, it is not.”

“Heart of the Glorious Lotus, they do not.”
“Venerable Śāriputra, symbolic designations of words are not words. The actions of that which is not a word are not knowable. They do not exist in this vehicle or in another vehicle. They do not exist over here, or over there, or in between. Therefore, those actions have truly passed beyond suffering. Venerable Śāriputra, the actions of bodhisattvas are like that.”

After traveling as far as the abode of Brahmā, the light rays returned, filling infinite and limitless world systems with light.

He will become consumed with anger at such unwelcome words. (2) Furthermore, Ānanda, that monk will be attached to the self and have no boundaries. Ānanda, a monk who has these two qualities will reject the awakening of a buddha and become consumed with anger at such unwelcome words. (3) Furthermore, Ānanda, a monk with flawed discipline will behave improperly. Because their discipline is flawed, he will become timid when he hears lectures on discipline. Ānanda, a monk who has these three qualities rejects the awakening of a buddha and is consumed with anger at such unwelcome words. (4) Furthermore, Ānanda, a monk who has a view with reference points will assert the existence of a self. If he hears lectures on emptiness, he will become scared, fearful, and frightened with regard to nonattachment.
