{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-064-005-135}}}One who desires to produce a great rainfall  should first go to an open, clean area and erect a blue canopy, decorating it with blue pennants.  The Dharma practitioner should bathe their body, abide by the eightfold precepts, and don clean blue garments. Having anointed themselves with pleasant-smelling incense, they should consume the three white foods and seat themselves upon a blue cushion, facing east. After supplicating all the tathāgatas, they should read aloud this chapter on the array of winds from The Great Cloud, day and night without interruption.
{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-064-005-136}}}They should set out four vases filled with blue water, together with as much offering cakes, incense, and flowers as they can gather. The Dharma practitioner should then use liquified cow dung to draw figures in the four directions. {{page:{number:26,id:UT22084-064-005-506,folio:F.263.a}}} In the eastern direction they should use cow dung to draw a three-headed nāga king, three cubits tall, with a retinue of various nāga attendants. In the southern direction they should draw a five-headed nāga king, five cubits tall, with a retinue of various nāga attendants. In the western direction they should draw a seven-headed nāga king, seven cubits tall, with a retinue of various nāga attendants. In the northern direction they should draw a nine-headed nāga king, nine cubits tall, with a retinue of various nāga attendants. The Dharma practitioner should guard their own body, abiding in loving-kindness, and establish an attitude of compassion toward all sentient beings.

The ocean may recede with the tides, but this ritual for bringing rainfall, the speech of the Great Sage, will never change.
