Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying in an incomparable mansion that was so vast as to be indistinct from the center of the expanse of phenomena that extends throughout the domain of space. It was a miraculous emanation of his own accumulation of merit and wisdom, and it was unlike any contrived phenomena in the three worlds. Completely beyond comparison, it was born from the Thus-Gone One’s inconceivable karmic ripening. He resided there together with a great assembly of 1,250 monks, most of whom were arhats who had attained correct discernment, and all of whom were liberated from the two factors. Also present were exceedingly pure bodhisattva great beings who were constantly in samādhi, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-065-001-1224,folio:F.2.a}}} who maintained the scope and referents of omniscient wisdom, who reached the culmination of the sublime expanse of phenomena that is without center or edge, who had perfected all of the aims and intentions of a bodhisattva, who had mastered the realization of all the bodhisattva powers, who had attained the ten culminations, who were adorned with infinite ornaments of good qualities, and who had mastered the realization of the samādhi, dhāraṇī, patience, and correct discernments of a bodhisattva. There were also hundreds of thousands of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, śakras, brahmās, and many hundreds of thousands of resplendent world guardians, along with many hundreds of thousands of attendants.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-065-001-103}}}On that occasion, the Blessed One was teaching the great approach to the Dharma called Entering the Gate of the Progressive Approach to All Dharmas:

{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-065-001-116}}}This is what the Blessed One taught as the great Dharma discourse called Entering the Gate of the Progressive Approach to All Dharmas.
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-065-001-117}}}Present in that assembly inside the mansion were two bodhisattvas with their many servants. One was named Nirārambha and the other Mativikrama. They met and shared this thought: “There is a Dharma discourse of bodhisattvas called Vast Intelligence.” They then said aloud, “We should discuss it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-065-001-118}}}The bodhisattva great being Mativikrama then inquired of the bodhisattva great being Nirārambha, “Child of good family, how should bodhisattva great beings understand the arising of the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas? How should bodhisattva great beings understand the essence of the thus-gone ones? How should they understand the different conditions through which thus-gone ones arise? Child of good family, how should bodhisattvas understand the state of the thus-gone ones? Child of good family, how should bodhisattvas understand the great final nirvāṇa of the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas? How should they understand the approach?

{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-065-001-122}}}When the bodhisattva great being Mativikrama finished speaking, the bodhisattva great being Nirārambha said to him, “Child of good family, you have asked about this exceedingly excellent Dharma discourse of bodhisattva great beings.

(5) The Thus-Gone One does not have hunger or thirst, he does not defecate or urinate, nor does he have a weak body. He goes for alms but does not ask for or request food.

What are these ten? (1) Take the example of the sun. It rises equally for and shines equally on all inferior, average, and superior beings, and on all of those with and without faith. Similarly, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha also equally rises for and shines the light of wisdom on inferior, average, and superior beings, and on those with and without faith. (2) Take the example of space. Its essential quality is that it does not obstruct any being in any way. Otherwise, it would always appear to have fleeting obscurations like smoke, clouds, dust, and fog. Similarly, the Thus-Gone One, like space, is essentially unobscured for all beings. Otherwise, because of being obscured by grasping at ‘I’ and ‘mine,’ which are comparable to fleeting smoke, clouds, dust, and fog, the Thus-Gone one would not be visible or accessible to beings. (3) Take the example of fire. Although fire can be found in all wood, without all the right conditions and effort it will not ignite, thus not fulfilling its own potential. Similarly, the Thus-Gone One is present in all objects of knowledge, but without all the right conditions, like faith and so forth, and without effort, he will not appear and will not perform awakened activities. (4) Take the example of pouring different colors into a single vessel, and then soaking different strips of cloth in those many colors. The colors will take based on the potency of the container,{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-065-001-142}}} but the colors have no conscious influence.

It flows downward when praised, and still flows downward when spoken to with enmity and curses. Similarly, whether one is praising or speaking badly of the Thus-Gone One, he proceeds with wisdom, not with pride. (6) Take the example of sugarcane. It is cut into many pieces but does not lose its sweet taste. Similarly, it does not matter if the Thus-Gone One is worshiped or not, when one attends to him the sweet taste of liberation is not lost. (7) Take the example of the earth. It persists without thinking or changing. Those who want profit from it plow it, cultivate it, and sow seeds so that their harvest will be abundant. Those who do not plow it, cultivate it, or sow seeds will not have an abundant harvest. Similarly, the Thus-Gone One, like the earth, persists without thinking or changing. Those who wish for good qualities and arouse faith, sincerity, and respect toward the Thus-Gone One will have an abundant harvest of good qualities. Those who do not arouse faith, sincerity, and respect toward the Thus-Gone One will not have an abundant harvest of good qualities. (8) Take, for example, the fact that some people disparage sandalwood and camphor and say that it is bad, while still smearing their bodies with them. Sandalwood and camphor make them fragrant and not smell bad. Similarly, people say nasty things about the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, but after disparaging him, they serve and rely on him. The Thus-Gone One instills in those who revere him the fragrance of awakened qualities. (9) Take, for example, how a bridge, {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-065-001-1240,folio:F.10.a}}} causeway, or royal road{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-065-001-143}}} does not obstruct inferior, average, or superior people, but rather permits easy travel equally. Similarly, the Thus-Gone One shows no bias for inferior, average, or superior beings, is not obscured, and engages them equally by moving with ease among them. (10) Take, for example, the king of medicines called beautiful to behold, found on the snowy king of mountains. As soon as it is seen, all the illnesses that beset all beings will disappear. Similarly, as soon as the Thus-Gone One is seen, all of the illnesses that beset all beings will be cured. Child of good family, bodhisattvas should understand the examples and comparisons of the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas through these ten approaches to the way of the Dharma.

{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-065-001-147}}}“What is the buddha as a supporting cause? This refers to the buddha as the supporting cause of the perfections and that which causes the accomplishment of the quality of perfection. That which is accomplished through those two is the accomplished buddha, thus it is called ‘the buddha as a supporting cause.’

This refers to the samādhi settled into—to the samādhi that, once settled into, produces one hundred thousand buddhas naturally and effortlessly. Because this buddha arises from samādhi through the blessings of that samādhi, this is called the buddha of samādhi. This is what is meant by ‘the buddha of samādhi.’
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-065-001-150}}}“What is the buddha of aspirations? After a bodhisattva makes the aspiration, ‘May beings be tamed through whatever forms, colors, and actions will tame them,’ the beings who can be tamed by a buddha are tamed by the physical form of a buddha. Because of arising from that aspiration, it is called the buddha of aspiration. This is what is meant by ‘the buddha of aspiration.’
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-065-001-151}}}“What is the buddha of mind? It is the power over the mind that, once attained by a bodhisattva, allows them to bring into being whatever they imagine. When they see beings who have been tamed by a buddha, they form the resolve, ‘May I take the form of a buddha.’ Because this arises from the mind, it is the buddha of mind. Those who were tamed also purify their own minds and come to see and know the buddha. This is what is meant by ‘the buddha of mind.’
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-065-001-152}}}“What is the essential buddha? The essential buddha is the inconceivable transformation of negative states appearing as a buddha body with a variety of stainless forms as an expression of different aspects of the expanse of phenomena. It has various forms, appearances, and shapes, and is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great person. This is what is meant by ‘the essential buddha.’

If the aggregate of form were to exist ultimately, existence would cease upon its abandonment. Something that is freed through being abandoned would then either exist as something that remained or exist as something that changed. This is not the case, therefore the teaching on the aggregate of form is a conventional teaching. In the same way, teachings on the aggregates of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are conventional teachings. The aggregate of consciousness does not ultimately exist. If the aggregate of consciousness were to exist ultimately, existence would cease upon its abandonment. Something that is freed through being abandoned would then either exist as something that remained or exist as something that changed.

If the performance of actions were to exist, the performance of actions would not be created, like space. But, if it were compounded like the aggregates, it would not be created, just like space. That which is uncreated could not be created, entailing that no actions could ever be performed. If actions do not exist, how could actions ever come about? {{page:{number:22,id:UT22084-065-001-1244,folio:F.12.a}}} For these reasons, the teaching on actions is a conventional teaching.

If birth were to exist ultimately, it would be perpetual, and birth would not entail birth. That which is born through birth, and also that which is tormented by birth, would not exist. Therefore, the teaching on birth is a conventional teaching.
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-065-001-166}}}“How is the teaching on old age a conventional teaching? Old age does not ultimately exist. If old age were to exist ultimately, no one would become old. Those who are aged could not have been young, old, or very old. There would be no aging for a child, and thus a child would never age. If there were no old age, how would one become old? In such circumstances one who is not old would never age. If an old person aged, then why would a young person not age? Therefore, the teaching on aging is a conventional teaching.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-065-001-167}}}“How is the teaching on death a conventional teaching? Death does not ultimately exist. If death were to exist ultimately, it would be something acquired. It would then be logical that if a single living being acquired it, then all other living beings would not die; however, there is no one who does not die. Since it is taught that death does not come from anywhere or go anywhere, the teaching on death is a conventional teaching.

If transmigration upon death were to exist ultimately, the very same being who died would be the being who is born, entailing that the one who died would have two bodies upon birth: the body that transmigrated and the body in which they transmigrate. If transmigration were to exist, the five aggregates would also exist. Why? Because the consciousness that was freed from the aggregates would not have a point of access. {{page:{number:23,id:UT22084-065-001-1245,folio:F.12.b}}} It is consciousness that approaches and enters form, and consciousness that approaches sensation, approaches perception, and approaches formations. It is consciousness that depends on them, observes them, and enters them. An unsupported consciousness would not enter for even a moment.

The pacification of saṃsāra is called nirvāṇa. Saṃsāra is not itself nirvāṇa, nor is nirvāṇa distinct from saṃsāra. Saṃsāra, like a dream or an illusion, neither exists nor does not exist, nor does it arise because of being both existent and nonexistent. Just as saṃsāra does not exist or not exist and does not arise through being both existent and nonexistent, it does not cease because of not existing, not not existing, or being both existent and nonexistent. Alternatively, the cessation of perception and sensation is called nirvāṇa. Perception is just like a mirage; sensation is like a water bubble. Just as a mirages and water bubbles arise and cease, so it is with saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Therefore, the teaching on the peace of nirvāṇa is a conventional teaching.

They sustain all beings by ripening the harvest of the roots of virtue without seeking the slightest recompense from anyone.

The sun forms no concepts at all and does not seek the slightest recompense from anyone. In the same way, when bodhisattvas who propound the Dharma appear, the deep darkness of all beings’ ignorance vanishes, and by their shining light beings cultivate their respective roots of virtue. Followers of the Dharma form no concepts at all and do not seek the slightest recompense from anyone.

They do not apprehend any phenomena that fall outside the scope of dependent arising, or of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, or that fall outside the scope of space. This undiminished diligence for awakening and ripening beings is a bodhisattva’s practice of insight.

It is their continuous efforts to ripen beings while not conceptually fixating on beings. It is their continual guarding of the senses while not conceptually fixating on the afflictive emotions. Though forms that are not even slightly different than a buddha’s form do not appear to them, they continually wish to see a buddha. Though sounds that are not sounds of the Dharma do not ring out to them, they are continually unsatiated by the Dharma they hear. They do not conceptually fixate on saṃsāra, but continually fear saṃsāra. They do not conceptually fixate on nirvāṇa, but they give away all their wealth in order to realize nirvāṇa. They do not conceptually fixate on the Buddha or awakening, but they strive to make hundreds of thousands of aspirations to realize the awakening of buddhahood. This is known as a bodhisattva’s practice of skillful means.
{{milestone:{label:1.195,id:UT22084-065-001-389}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s practice of aspiration? Bodhisattvas do not observe any phenomena that decrease or increase, and yet they rejoice in the roots of virtue of all beings and dedicate them to unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening. They first share their own roots of virtue with all beings, and then dedicate them to unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening by saying, ‘May I perfectly and completely awaken to unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening. May my buddhafield be like this. May my perfect assembly be like that.’ These aspirations of theirs will be perfectly fulfilled; they will not go unfulfilled. Their discipline will not be broken, weaken, break down, or be contaminated. It will be praised and protected by the wise. {{page:{number:74,id:UT22084-065-001-1296,folio:F.38.a}}} Bodhisattvas mentally fulfill their aspirations by maintaining this discipline.

{{milestone:{label:1.196,id:UT22084-065-001-390}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s practice of strength? Even if someone were to take the form of a buddha and then approach a bodhisattva and try to turn them away from awakening to buddhahood, turn them away from their intention, and to separate them from it, the bodhisattva would not turn away from their intention. They would call to mind awakening and the seat of awakening, and would actualize the taming of Māra, turning the wheel of Dharma, and the experience of great compassion. Bodhisattvas will not get angry even when beings try to turn them away from their intention, separate them from it, or reverse their course. Instead, they will feel great love and great compassion for them. The strength of their faith, diligence, mindfulness, and samādhi will not falter. Therefore, due to the strength of such irreversibility, they will set and establish an infinite, incalculable number of beings in the awakening of buddhahood. This is known as a bodhisattva’s practice of strength.
{{milestone:{label:1.197,id:UT22084-065-001-391}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s practice of wisdom? Bodhisattvas think, ‘There is no birth, death, or old age here. These are just the way of phenomena. They are free of “I” and “mine.” ’ Thinking this, they perfectly understand exactly how things are. Through exactly this strength of wisdom they establish an infinite, incalculable number of beings in that strength of wisdom. No being has the capacity to turn them away from this basic reality and set them in worldly ways. This is known as a bodhisattva’s practice of wisdom.

For eight thousand gods, dust fell away from their Dharma eye that sees phenomena, and they became stainless and pure. 
{{milestone:{label:1.252,id:UT22084-065-001-462}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Nirārambha addressed the bodhisattva great being Mativikrama: “Child of good family, a bodhisattva should privilege the truth. Child of good family, a bodhisattva’s discourse on the Dharma is a discourse on the truth.{{note:{index:104,id:UT22084-065-001-463}}} Child of good family, what is this truth that compels a bodhisattva who has generated the mind set on unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening to not forsake that mind even at the cost of their life and to not act adversely toward beings? It is the truth of a bodhisattva. It would be a despicable lie to say that a bodhisattva would generate the mind set on unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening only to forsake it later and act adversely toward beings.”{{note:{index:105,id:UT22084-065-001-464}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.253,id:UT22084-065-001-465}}}Mativikrama asked, “Once they have generated the mind set on unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening, why will they not later forsake it and not act adversely toward any being?”
{{milestone:{label:1.254,id:UT22084-065-001-466}}}Nirārambha replied, “When bodhisattvas understand the truth of suffering, when they understand the truth of its origin, the truth of its cessation, and the truth of the path, they will not forsake that mind and will not act adversely toward any being.” {{page:{number:87,id:UT22084-065-001-1309,folio:F.44.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.255,id:UT22084-065-001-467}}}“What is the suffering that bodhisattvas know?” asked Mativikrama.
Nirārambha answered, “Suffering is the ripening of the experiences of pleasant and unpleasant in relation to the five aggregates that are the bases for clinging. This is suffering. When bodhisattvas know that this suffering is dependently originated, empty, unwavering, and devoid of ‘I’ and ‘mine,’ they are said to ‘know suffering.’ When they see that suffering merely in terms of its origin, as insubstantial and immaterial, as essenceless and without agency, they are said to ‘know its origin.’ When they know that there is nothing that comes from the previous life, migrates to the next life, or that arises in the present, when they know that suffering is beginningless and is naturally in a state of cessation, naturally empty, and naturally isolated, they are said to ‘know its cessation.’”
{{milestone:{label:1.256,id:UT22084-065-001-469}}}“Child of good family, what’s another word for cessation?” asked Mativikrama.
“Child of good family,” replied Nirārambha, “there is nothing that can express cessation.”
“Child of good family, if nothing can express cessation, why do we say ‘cessation’?” asked Mativikrama.
“Child of good family,” answered Nirārambha, “cessation is free of adventitious obscurations; it is false, nonexistent, and an imputation. When something is false, it is an imputation. That is considered cessation. A phenomenon that is false, an imputation, and ceases cannot be destroyed in any way. Therefore, all phenomena are said to have utterly ceased.”
{{milestone:{label:1.257,id:UT22084-065-001-473}}}Mativikrama then said, “Child of good family, the Blessed One also said, ‘A bodhisattva does not actualize cessation. A bodhisattva who actualizes cessation has fallen to the level of a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha.’ What did the Blessed One mean when he said that?”
{{milestone:{label:1.258,id:UT22084-065-001-474}}}“Child of good family,” answered Nirārambha, “the term actualize cannot be explained. Another way to put it would be see directly. {{page:{number:88,id:UT22084-065-001-1310,folio:F.45.a}}} The Blessed One also said, ‘Cessation is a phenomenon that cannot be explained.’ Any phenomena that cannot be explained cannot possibly be actualized. Therefore, the Blessed One said, ‘A bodhisattva can neither actualize nor directly see cessation.’ With that intended meaning in mind, he also said,{{note:{index:106,id:UT22084-065-001-475}}} ‘A bodhisattva does not actualize cessation. A śrāvaka has an intellect that grasps at a phenomenon’s attributes and thereby actualizes cessation. They remain that way and understand it as such.’ Those who apprehend and fixate their minds understand cessation in this way and see it as such. This kind of established certainty is what is known as knowing the path.
{{milestone:{label:1.259,id:UT22084-065-001-476}}}“Furthermore, child of good family, suffering is to cling to the notion of ‘I.’ Its origin is the arising of clinging to ‘mine’ along with the causes of that clinging. Knowing cessation is the recognition that there are no restrictive determinations{{note:{index:107,id:UT22084-065-001-477}}} of phenomena when they arise. Knowing the path is recognizing that and pursuing it.
{{milestone:{label:1.260,id:UT22084-065-001-478}}}“Furthermore, child of good family, arrogance is suffering. Why? Child of good family, the Blessed One said, ‘The nature of arrogance is suffering.’ Arrogance is always false; therefore, the origin of arrogance is the origin of suffering, the absence of suffering is cessation, and the wisdom through which arrogance ceases to be arrogance is the path.
{{milestone:{label:1.261,id:UT22084-065-001-479}}}“Child of good family, for an eon and more I have not been able to fully realize this teaching on knowing the truth of a bodhisattva.”{{note:{index:108,id:UT22084-065-001-480}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.262,id:UT22084-065-001-481}}}When he finished explaining this teaching on truth, six thousand bodhisattvas realized the state of irreversible cultivation of the truth. For ten thousand goddesses present in the sky, dust fell away from their Dharma eye that sees phenomena, and they became stainless and pure.
{{milestone:{label:1.263,id:UT22084-065-001-482}}}The bodhisattva great being Mativikrama then asked the bodhisattva great being Nirārambha, {{page:{number:89,id:UT22084-065-001-1311,folio:F.45.b}}} “Child of good family, what is the application of mindfulness? What is mindfulness? What are the modes of mindfulness?”
{{milestone:{label:1.264,id:UT22084-065-001-483}}}The bodhisattva great being Nirārambha answered the bodhisattva great being Mativikrama, “Child of good family, for bodhisattvas, mindfulness is knowing that no phenomena arise. Bodhisattvas aspire to know the lack of arising. Their mindfulness is made pure by knowing the lack of arising. It is, in all situations, unwavering, direct, unmoving, and recognizes neither the depths nor the shore. It is difficult for worldly beings, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas to know. The mindfulness of a bodhisattva—which is the mindfulness that fully comprehends the words of all the buddhas—is the immediate experience of the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha. This is what the mindfulness of a bodhisattva is like.
{{milestone:{label:1.265,id:UT22084-065-001-484}}}“A bodhisattva’s mindfulness has ten modes: (1) the application of mindfulness of the body, (2) the application of mindfulness of sensations, (3) the application of mindfulness of mind, (4) the application of mindfulness of phenomena, (5) the application of mindfulness of recollecting the Buddha, (6) the application of mindfulness of recollecting the Dharma, (7) the application of mindfulness of recollecting the Saṅgha, (8) the application of mindfulness of recollecting discipline, (9) the application of mindfulness of recollecting giving, and (10) the application of mindfulness of recollecting divinities. These are the ten applications of mindfulness.
{{milestone:{label:1.266,id:UT22084-065-001-485}}}“What is the bodhisattvas’ application of mindfulness of the body? Bodhisattvas apply mindfulness to the body by thinking as follows: ‘This body did not come from a previous life, it does not migrate to the next life; it was not present in the previous life, and it will not be present in the next life. Otherwise, it would be false, and would arise from error. It would be devoid of one who acts and one who feels, and it would have no beginning, no end, and no middle. {{page:{number:90,id:UT22084-065-001-1312,folio:F.46.a}}} There is no fundamental root{{note:{index:109,id:UT22084-065-001-486}}} or governing power. There is no “mine” and no appropriation. Notions of “collection,” “body,” “enjoyment,” “basis,”{{note:{index:110,id:UT22084-065-001-487}}} “corpse,” and “sense base” are conventional designations based on superficial conventions. This body is without essence; it comes from the father’s semen and the mother’s blood. It is innately unclean, putrid, and foul-smelling. It is confounded by the thieves of desire, anger, dullness, fear, and sloth. It is continuously beset by decay, collapse, disintegration, decomposition, and destruction, and it is host to a hundred thousand different diseases.’{{note:{index:111,id:UT22084-065-001-488}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.267,id:UT22084-065-001-489}}}“Furthermore, child of good family, bodhisattvas think about what the body is like and apply mindfulness to the body as follows:{{note:{index:112,id:UT22084-065-001-490}}} ‘This body is just a collection composed of the feet, toes, calves, thighs, sacrum,{{note:{index:113,id:UT22084-065-001-491}}} abdomen, navel, spine, heart, sides, ribs, palms,{{note:{index:114,id:UT22084-065-001-492}}} forearms, shoulders, neck, cheeks, forehead, and skull. It has been gathered through the impetus of karma’s arising and persists as the hundred thousand different afflictive emotions, secondary afflictive emotions, notions, and concepts. It is a collection of many substances: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, bone, skin, muscle, marrow, tendons, omentum, fat, serum, liver, urine, feces, stomach, intestines,{{note:{index:115,id:UT22084-065-001-493}}} blood, saliva, bile, pus, mucus, skull, and brain.’
{{milestone:{label:1.268,id:UT22084-065-001-494}}}“Bodhisattvas analytically think, ‘This body is equal to space,’ and apply mindfulness to the body that is space-like. They see everything as being space-like. {{page:{number:91,id:UT22084-065-001-1313,folio:F.46.b}}} They neither apply mindfulness to anything apart from that which comprehends the body, nor do they avoid it.{{note:{index:116,id:UT22084-065-001-495}}} This is known as sustaining mindfulness by neither applying it nor avoiding it. To sustain mindfulness in this way is to correctly know that the body accords with awakening. There is nothing that obstructs this. Why? Because anything that obstructs it is not fundamental to it. This is what is known as a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of the body. 
{{milestone:{label:1.269,id:UT22084-065-001-496}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of sensations? A bodhisattva thinks, ‘Sensations are something understood; that knowledge{{note:{index:117,id:UT22084-065-001-497}}} is either erroneous, correct, or free of both.’ The sensations of naive, ordinary people, whose minds are distracted and in error, are also in error. They experience the impermanent as permanent, suffering as happiness, selflessness as the self, and the impure as pure. These are erroneous sensations. Experiencing the impermanent as impermanent, suffering as suffering, selflessness as selflessness, and the impure as impure are the sensations of śrāvakas. Experiencing the impermanent as neither impermanent nor not impermanent, suffering as neither suffering nor happiness, selflessness as neither selfless nor not selfless, and the impure as neither impure nor not impure are the sensations of bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.270,id:UT22084-065-001-498}}}“A bodhisattva does not recognize an experiencer of these sensations, and in not recognizing one, does not in any way recognize sensations either. A bodhisattva thinks, ‘The Blessed One said, “All compounded things involve sensation.” If all compounded things involve sensation,{{note:{index:118,id:UT22084-065-001-499}}} there would be something referred to as an “experiencer.” Sensations are not the cause of sensations; there is nothing to be sensed, no sensation, and no cause of sensation. {{page:{number:92,id:UT22084-065-001-1314,folio:F.47.a}}} Even the uncompounded is not the cause of sensation for the compounded. There is nothing at all that causes sensation that is independent of the compounded and uncompounded. Thus, a bodhisattva recognizes that there is no sensation in any of those sensations.’ A bodhisattva does not recognize any kind of effort derived through sensation. This correct recognition of how sensation accords with awakening is what is known as a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of sensations.
{{milestone:{label:1.271,id:UT22084-065-001-500}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of the mind? A bodhisattva thinks, ‘A sensation is merely the mind, and that mind has no location, has no grasping, and has no body. What would the location be for that which has no status, no grasping, and no body?’ The bodhisattva sees that the mind is not known by the mind, the mind is not seen by the mind, and that a mind that arises on the basis of something is dependent on something other and has no independent agency. Even awakening is not known separately from the mind.{{note:{index:119,id:UT22084-065-001-501}}} By knowing awakening as merely the mind, bodhisattvas attain power over the mind, and through their power over the mind they master the Great Vehicle. They regard all beings equally and cannot be dissuaded by others from the Great Vehicle. This is known as a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of the mind.
{{milestone:{label:1.272,id:UT22084-065-001-502}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of phenomena? Bodhisattvas whose mindfulness has fully comprehended, fully trained in, fully gathered, fully mastered, and taken full independent control over any phenomena to which mindfulness can be applied—virtuous and nonvirtuous, fallible and infallible, defiled and undefiled, mundane and transmundane phenomena, as well as the phenomena of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary people—will consider them equal insofar as they do not arise or cease. {{page:{number:93,id:UT22084-065-001-1315,folio:F.47.b}}} They do not recognize any phenomenon that transcends being unarisen and unceasing, that transcends dependent arising, or that transcends being empty, signless, and wishless.
{{milestone:{label:1.273,id:UT22084-065-001-503}}}“The bodhisattva thinks, ‘All phenomena lack something that possesses them; they are naturally isolated. All phenomena lack a self; they are naturally nondual. All phenomena are unobscured; they have the nature of space. All phenomena are nonconceptual; they are free of mind, thought, and the mind consciousness. All phenomena are essentially liberated; they are naturally free of the afflictive emotions. All phenomena are indescribable; they are naturally inexpressible. All phenomena are inarticulable; they are naturally uncontrived. All phenomena are incalculable; they completely transcend all calculations. All phenomena are straightforward; they completely transcend all conceptual elaborations. All phenomena are rootless because they are seedless. All phenomena are faultless because they are purified at the root. No phenomena arrive because they are incorporeal. No phenomena depart because they are not located anywhere. All phenomena are unobstructed because they are empty. All phenomena are empty because they originate dependently. All phenomena escape because they are nonconceptual. All phenomena are independent because they are understood in whatever manner is desired. All phenomena are fully realized because they are innately knowable. All phenomena are mere designations because they are immaterial. All phenomena are unobservable because they are innately unsupported. All phenomena are unfettered because they are incorporeal. All phenomena are unliberated because they are essenceless. All phenomena are not impervious because of their essential state of suchness. {{page:{number:94,id:UT22084-065-001-1316,folio:F.48.a}}} All phenomena are of a single scope because of the indivisibility of the expanse of phenomena. And all phenomena are undifferentiated because they are equal to the limit of reality.’ Thinking this, bodhisattvas examine phenomena in this way and sustain that examination.
{{milestone:{label:1.274,id:UT22084-065-001-504}}}“Bodhisattvas who examine phenomena as such and sustain that examination do not differentiate between beings. They do not differentiate between phenomena, vehicles, buddhas, or buddhafields. They do not recognize inferior and superior, bondage and release, or saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. They lack abandonment, grasping, engaging, avoiding, accepting, and rejecting. They attain and maintain a state of nondistraction. Those bodhisattva great beings who sustain peace will be seen by the blessed buddhas residing in their different buddhafields, and will be prophesied by them to attain unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening. This is known as a bodhisattva’s application of mindfulness of phenomena.

A bodhisattva’s application of the mindfulness of recollecting the Buddha is to cultivate the following: After bringing all beings immediately to mind, they apply mindfulness with the thought, ‘May I and all beings achieve unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening. To that end I will achieve the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas’ ten strengths of a thus-gone one, four kinds of fearlessness, and eighteen unique qualities.’ Through that mindfulness, bodhisattvas recollect the mindfulness of the blessed buddhas, which is inconceivable, stainless, pure, luminous, and free of latent impressions; in which the entire nexus of habitual patterns has been severed; which is based in wisdom, governed by wisdom, and governed by all the buddhas, the Dharma, {{page:{number:95,id:UT22084-065-001-1317,folio:F.48.b}}} and the divine; in which all types of certainty have been obtained; which lacks the stains that obscure objects of knowledge and so cannot be comprehended by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; and which is spontaneously present, of unhindered power, is sustained without obstruction, enhances the thoughts of all beings, and is unchanging like space. They recollect the buddhas through these ways of recollection. They recollect with modes of mindfulness that are the precious jewels of the buddhas, the treasury of the buddhas. For that reason, this is known as the recollection of the Buddha.

A bodhisattva endeavors in gathering the conventional saṅgha, serving the ultimate saṅgha, liberating the modest saṅgha, taming the immodest saṅgha, and worshiping and venerating the noble saṅgha; endeavors just as the Buddha did with the exalted saṅgha; and endeavors for the sake of Dharma instruction among the irreversible saṅgha.’
{{milestone:{label:1.284,id:UT22084-065-001-530}}}“Furthermore, a bodhisattva thinks, ‘The saṅgha of a buddha’s heirs upholds the lineage. The saṅgha of excellent fields yields pleasing fruit. The saṅgha of the fearless frees from bad rebirths. The saṅgha of those devoid of the ordinary mind forsakes and casts aside grasping. The exalted saṅgha tames intently. The saṅgha that is free of afflictive emotions is uncontaminated. The saṅgha of the modest is free of evil. {{page:{number:101,id:UT22084-065-001-1323,folio:F.51.b}}} The saṅgha of disciples takes pleasure in instruction. The saṅgha that lacks the notion of “mine” fully understands the self. The saṅgha devoid of arrogance is peaceful. The saṅgha that is free of error has few desires. The saṅgha free of illness cuts through conceptual thought. The saṅgha that remains on level ground has reached the other shore. The saṅgha that has attained happiness remains on level ground. The saṅgha of the vigilant sees things as they are. The saṅgha of the forest dwellers is not interested in faults. The saṅgha of those dedicated to awakening is vast. The saṅgha of those who seek training knows the ways of the three trainings. The saṅgha of the mindful falls within the scope of the applications of mindfulness. The saṅgha of those compelled by diligence falls within the scope of correct abandonment. The saṅgha of the unwearied falls within the scope of the bases of miraculous power. The saṅgha of the unrelenting falls within the scope of power. The saṅgha of the untroubled falls within the scope of strength. The saṅgha of the unobscured falls within the scope of the branches of awakening. The saṅgha of those with correct view falls within the scope of the path. The saṅgha of noble ones falls within the scope of truth. The saṅgha of those with meditative composure falls within the scope of meditative stability. The saṅgha that turns the wheel of Dharma falls within the scope of dependent arising. The irreversible saṅgha possesses great compassion. And the saṅgha of those with only a single birth remaining has accumulated the requisite of all merit.’ A bodhisattva who calls the saṅgha to mind in this way will think, {{page:{number:102,id:UT22084-065-001-1324,folio:F.52.a}}} ‘May I and all beings accomplish these perfect qualities of the saṅgha.’
“This is what is known as a bodhisattva’s application of the mindfulness of recollecting the Saṅgha.
{{milestone:{label:1.285,id:UT22084-065-001-532}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s application of the mindfulness of recollecting discipline? A bodhisattva thinks, ‘I see that all that is excellent and perfect, both mundane and transcendent, arises from discipline. How so? Discipline is the basis for all that is excellent and perfect. The earth, for example, is the basis for all medicinal plants, grasses, and forests. Just so, discipline is the basis for all that is excellent and perfect. Bodhisattvas who maintain a basis of discipline are worthy recipients of worship by the world and its gods. Doing so also perfects the practice of generosity. Bodhisattvas who maintain a basis of discipline experience joy. Joyful in mind, they have no regrets, and without regrets, they attain supreme joy. Through their supreme joy they become physically and mentally pliable, and they reach a stage of bliss through that physical and mental pliancy and attain samādhi. Resting in meditative composure they see everything exactly as it is. Bodhisattvas who see everything exactly as it is act with great compassion for beings.’
{{milestone:{label:1.286,id:UT22084-065-001-533}}}“A bodhisattva also thinks, ‘For the sake of all beings I should accomplish this gateway of samādhi and be able to see phenomena exactly as they are. Motivated with that kind of great compassion, one perfects the trainings of higher discipline, higher intention, and higher insight, and then awakens to unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening. {{page:{number:103,id:UT22084-065-001-1325,folio:F.52.b}}} Therefore I too will be unshakeable and steady in maintaining discipline. I will guard my discipline with all beings in mind.’{{note:{index:134,id:UT22084-065-001-534}}} Why do they think this? The discipline of bodhisattvas benefits all beings and is a support for happiness. It does not fail as a support for it.
{{milestone:{label:1.287,id:UT22084-065-001-535}}}“Furthermore, a bodhisattva thinks, ‘A bodhisattva’s discipline of leaving home brings about the perfection of a mind without harmful intent. A bodhisattva’s discipline as a renunciant perfects the abandonment of all possessions. A bodhisattva’s discipline of maintaining their trainings and vows perfects purity in body, speech, and mind. A bodhisattva’s discipline of contemplation perfects the six higher cognitions. A bodhisattva’s discipline of settling internally perfects the factors of awakening. A bodhisattva’s discipline of listening to the Dharma perfects the four correct discernments. A bodhisattva’s discipline of seeking learning perfects the absence of pride. A bodhisattva’s discipline of serving a spiritual friend perfects the indestructibility of their virtuous qualities. A bodhisattva’s discipline of the perfections perfects omniscient wisdom. A bodhisattva’s discipline of teaching the Dharma just as they heard it perfects their status as a Dharma reciter. A bodhisattva’s discipline of reflecting on the Dharma just as they heard it perfects their dhāraṇī and confident eloquence. A bodhisattva’s discipline of the mind set on awakening perfects their transcendence of all births. {{page:{number:104,id:UT22084-065-001-1326,folio:F.53.a}}} A bodhisattva’s discipline of not feeling hostile toward any being perfects the indestructibility of the mind set on awakening. A bodhisattva’s discipline of the indestructible mind set on awakening perfects the indestructibility of the Three Jewels.’ They also think, ‘Those who have guarded their discipline have guarded all that needs guarding.’

{{milestone:{label:1.289,id:UT22084-065-001-537}}}“What is a bodhisattva’s application of the mindfulness of recollecting giving? A bodhisattva thinks, ‘All that can be given is included in the two types of giving: giving material goods and giving the Dharma.’ By giving material goods, bodhisattvas perfect the purity that completes the major and minor marks, purify buddhafields, and ripen beings. By the giving of Dharma, bodhisattvas perfect the ten strengths, the four kinds of fearlessness, and the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha. Habitual patterns are also destroyed.

{{milestone:{label:1.292,id:UT22084-065-001-540}}}“Giving material goods brings about ripening. Giving the Dharma brings about release. Giving material goods gathers the requisites. Giving the Dharma brings liberation. By giving material goods bodhisattvas give up wealth. By giving the Dharma, they give up everything. By giving material goods bodhisattvas effect liberation from the obscurations of the afflictive emotions. By giving the Dharma, they effect liberation from cognitive obscurations.
{{milestone:{label:1.293,id:UT22084-065-001-541}}}“Another way giving is defined as ‘giving’ is in terms of giving up conceptual designations. That is to say, this mode of giving is supreme among all modes of giving. Why? By giving up conceptual designations one is known as an authentic bodhisattva.”
{{milestone:{label:1.294,id:UT22084-065-001-542}}}Mativikrama then asked, “Child of good family, what does conceptual designation refer to?”
“Child of good family,” replied Nirārambha, “a conceptual designation is false and an imputation based on nothing.”
“How is it false and an imputation based on nothing?” asked Mativikrama.
{{milestone:{label:1.295,id:UT22084-065-001-545}}}Nirārambha replied, “All imputations, such as thinking ‘I am attached,’ ‘I am angry,’ ‘I am dull,’ ‘I am afflicted,’ ‘I am pure,’ ‘I am fettered,’ ‘I am free,’ ‘I am in saṃsāra,’ ‘I have passed into nirvāṇa,’ and similar thoughts are false and are conceptual designations based on nothing. How so? They are all circumstantial; there is no ‘I’ or ‘mine,’ no being, no life force, no person, no human being, no humankind. They are all circumstantial, and naturally empty. They are naturally isolated and free of mind, thought, and the mental consciousness. {{page:{number:106,id:UT22084-065-001-1328,folio:F.54.a}}} They are not sentient but are conceptual designations. They are not afflicted or pure and are not related to saṃsāra or nirvāṇa. Bodhisattvas do not form imputations on what does not exist. Giving up imputations is known as perfect giving. When bodhisattvas recollect this quality, it is known as the recollection of giving.
{{milestone:{label:1.296,id:UT22084-065-001-546}}}“Furthermore, child of good family, a bodhisattva’s practice of giving is of three types: giving, great giving, the supreme giving.

It is the giving of food to those who need food, and the giving of drink, conveyances, clothes, lamps, incense, fragrances, garlands, ointments, powders, cloth, parasols, banners, flags, chariots, ornaments, and so forth. There is no object bodhisattvas do not give to beings apart from that which would harm or ruin them. This is known as the bodhisattvas’ practice of giving.

All their appearances, many states of bliss, and sensory gratifications are the ripening of the path of the ten virtuous deeds.’ Bodhisattvas will then rejoice in that divine bliss, and dedicate themselves to unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening for the benefit of all beings. They wish that all beings would have divine bliss, and through the wish that all beings have that divine bliss, then establish the great diligence required to accomplish the roots of virtue.

“Honorable Śāriputra,” replied the bodhisattva Nirārambha, “I do not act in pursuit of a purpose or of something meaningless. Why? One who acts in pursuit of a purpose acts in relation to an object of reference, and one who acts in relation to an object of reference displeases the buddhas. How so? One who acts in relation to an object of reference has not attained concordant acceptance. Lacking this acceptance, they displease the buddhas.

“Honorable Śāriputra,” replied the bodhisattva Nirārambha, “all ordinary childish people certainly act in pursuit of the very same things that the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas pursue, but they do not think, ‘We act in pursuit of the very same things that the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddhas pursue.’
{{milestone:{label:1.354,id:UT22084-065-001-619}}}“Child of good family,” countered the venerable Śāriputra, “ordinary childish people lack the circumstances to be within the scope of a buddha.

Form, sound, scent, taste, texture, and phenomena are the apprehended objects. ‘Omniscience’ refers to the capacity to know these phenomena of the apprehended objects and apprehending subjects in all their aspects and modes, to understand them, and to reveal them.

Because they believe in a self and think, ‘I teach, they listen.’ Those lacking the perception of a self do not teach the Dharma after imputing a self, after imputing an other, or after imputing both. They do not teach after forming latent impressions. Why? Blessed One, it is because all imputations are imputations based on nothing. Blessed One, an imputed phenomenon does not substantially exist. To elaborate, the Dharma is an imputation made by bodhisattva great beings who understand imputations. How so? Blessed One, the imputations of a bodhisattva who understands imputations are similar to describing a magical illusion. Blessed One, an imputation is called an imputation, so what is meant by ‘imputation,’ Blessed One? It is an imputation to not reject emptiness and dependent arising; it is to be in accord with the unarisen and unceasing; it is the transcendence of ideas, concepts, and paradigms; it is the disruption of clinging to ‘I’ and ‘mine’; it is the clearing away of all adopted views. That is the imputation of bodhisattva great beings who understand imputation. {{page:{number:129,id:UT22084-065-001-1351,folio:F.65.b}}} That which leads to this understanding of imputation is a discourse on the Dharma.

Bodhisattvas who understand the equality of all phenomena in this way feel no anger toward any sound, but rather hear all sounds as the sound of the Dharma. They hear all sounds as the sound of emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, the expanse of phenomena, and of the limit of reality. There are absolutely no phenomena that contradict the realization of omniscience. There are absolutely no phenomena to be found that contradict awakening to buddhahood.

Their great love is to give up all possessions; their great compassion is to give up all possessions and dedicate the roots of virtue so that all beings attain buddhahood. Their great love is not allowing their discipline, training, and commitments to deteriorate; their great compassion is to use their own discipline to guard the discipline of other beings.

All the other qualities of a buddha will manifest naturally for bodhisattvas who investigate. Bodhisattvas who prioritize investigation will easily attain perfect awakening. They also have the power of dhāraṇī. What is a bodhisattva’s power of dhāraṇī? It is the means by which bodhisattvas do not forget the Dharma teachings they have heard, remember them as they heard them, understands them as they heard them, and otherwise cultivate understanding. It is the means by which they are undistracted and nonconceptual. It is the means by which they remember the collection of eighty-four thousand Dharma teachings without needing to recall them and without allowing them to slip from their memory. It is the means by which they examine the conduct of all beings and, upon examination, engage with them appropriately. It is the means by which they listen to what beings say, and upon hearing it, feel great compassion for the words of the ignoble and great love for the statements of the noble ones. It is the means by which they can learn a single word of the Dharma and teach on it for an eon without reaching the limit of or exhausting their confident eloquence. It is the means by which they understand what is said and not said and understand the Buddha’s teaching in every statement. It is the means by which they hear the teachings of the thus-gone, blessed, completely perfect buddhas in every worldly realm throughout the ten directions, {{page:{number:163,id:UT22084-065-001-1385,folio:F.82.b}}} and upon hearing them, comprehend it all. The bodhisattvas’ power of dhāraṇī is that which allows them to hear the Dharma directly from one thus-gone one without obscuring the Dharma teachings given by a second thus-gone one.

They reduce without diminishing and speak without actually saying anything. They pass into nirvāṇa without leaving saṃsāra, attain the status of a noble one without deviating from the state of an ordinary person, and are victorious over Māra without suppressing others with their body, speech, or mind.

Why? Blessed One, nothing possesses liberation, nor is there any liberation. Blessed One, liberation neither enhances nor diminishes any phenomena. Blessed One, liberation does not come from somewhere, nor does bondage go anywhere. Blessed One, monks whose minds are liberated in this way do not think, ‘I have a liberated mind.’ Rather, they have determined that liberation applies to all phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:1.463,id:UT22084-065-001-805}}}“Blessed One, someone who thus thinks that saṃsāra is full of faults and nirvāṇa is liberation does not have a liberated mind. Why? This indicates that they mentally cling to the self. Blessed One, someone who thinks, ‘My aggregates, elements, and sense bases have sufficiently passed into final nirvāṇa’ does not have a liberated mind. Why? This indicates that they mentally cling to the self. Blessed One, a monk whose mind is liberated thinks, ‘All phenomena have this quality of liberation, which is something that ordinary foolish beings do not know. I should come to understand the true state of things in this way.’

Why? Because those who seek liberation do not attain liberation.’ {{page:{number:165,id:UT22084-065-001-1387,folio:F.83.b}}} Thus, Blessed One, a monk who seeks liberation actively seeks bondage.

{{milestone:{label:1.465,id:UT22084-065-001-808}}}The bodhisattva Sāgaramati next addressed the Blessed One: “Blessed One, a bodhisattva does not fear the afflictive emotions. Why? Because where there are afflictive emotions there is awakening, and where there are no afflictive emotions there is no awakening. Emptiness and the afflictive emotions are not two; they cannot be separated into two. Blessed One, awakening and the afflictive emotions are not two; they cannot be separated into two. This is not something that ordinary foolish beings understand. Because their minds have sunk into error, they think, ‘I am afflicted’ and ‘I am pure.’ Blessed One, a bodhisattva who takes the correct approach neither clears away afflictive emotions nor fails to be free of afflictive emotions. A bodhisattva who analyzes the gateway of the afflictive emotions attains the gateway of samādhi and dhāraṇī.
{{milestone:{label:1.466,id:UT22084-065-001-809}}}“Therefore, Blessed One, the afflictive emotions themselves are classified among a bodhisattva’s qualities of buddhahood. A foolish being whose mind is distracted by afflictive emotions and falls into error is inclined to the lower realms and experiences suffering. Bodhisattvas correctly analyze them and understand the awakening of buddhahood. Blessed One, bodhisattvas thus go against the current; they act while not following the current.

Bodhisattvas fear nirvāṇa but not saṃsāra. When they analyze saṃsāra they gain compassion for beings and attain the awakening of buddhahood. When they investigate nirvāṇa they grow hostile toward saṃsāra, and a bodhisattva who grows angry with saṃsāra undermines awakening to buddhahood. A bodhisattva’s great love and compassion develops by remaining in saṃsāra, but not when remaining in nirvāṇa. Blessed One, the term nirvāṇa applied to nirvāṇa is not accurate; it is another way of saying ‘pacified concepts.’ Therefore, Blessed One, a bodhisattva who pursues nirvāṇa pursues the pacification of concepts, and based on that attains nirvāṇa. Blessed One, this is a discourse on the Dharma.”

Blessed One, if bodhisattvas fully understand and comprehend a single quality, then, Blessed One, all the qualities of the Buddha will be in the palm of their hand. What is this one Dharma teaching? It is great compassion. Blessed One, through great compassion the entire Dharma of the Buddha is in the bodhisattvas’ hands. As an analogy, Blessed One, wherever the precious wheel of a universal monarch goes, there too go his army battalions.

When there is perfect intention, Blessed One, the Dharma{{note:{index:196,id:UT22084-065-001-819}}} will arise from the center of space, from a wall, or from trees when a buddha is not present. For bodhisattvas with pure intention, all advice and instructions spring from the activity of their own minds. Therefore, Blessed One, bodhisattvas should perfect intention.

If bodhisattvas were to disturb some phenomenon, it would require great difficulty for them to attain acceptance that phenomena do not arise. Blessed One, bodhisattvas who do not disturb phenomena and cultivate meditative stability will continue without decline, and they will cause no offense to the thus-gone ones. They realize that all the qualities of a buddha depend on their own mind, and they will do nothing to agitate it.

Because of attaining this mental equanimity, they do not conceptualize, regress, give up, cling, or aspire.

Mañjuśrī, I will prophesy the unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening of those beings who hear this way and adopt it, do not abandon it, and do not disparage it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.494,id:UT22084-065-001-860}}}At that moment the bodhisattva great being Nirārambha unfastened a pearl necklace worth a hundred thousand{{note:{index:210,id:UT22084-065-001-862}}} and cast it toward the Blessed One. He then said, “Blessed One, through the Dharma of giving, may all beings become exactly like the thus-gone, blessed, completely perfect Buddha.” The pearl necklace then became a mansion directly above the Blessed One’s head that was visible to both gods and humans. It was a beautifully decorated square palace that had not been previously seen or heard about by the great śrāvakas, bodhisattvas, Indra, Brahmā, or the world guardians. It followed the Blessed One as he moved and remained in place when he sat. The great crowd of gods and humans were astounded and amazed; filled with wonder, they joined their palms above their heads. They then bowed toward the Blessed One and remained there, wide-eyed.
{{milestone:{label:1.495,id:UT22084-065-001-863}}}The bodhisattva great being Nirārambha felt amazed and delighted. {{page:{number:177,id:UT22084-065-001-1399,folio:F.89.b}}} He adjusted his upper robe on one shoulder, knelt down on his right knee, touched the Blessed One’s feet, and bowed. He then faced the Blessed One, joined his palms, bowed slightly, and praised him directly with these verses:

Blessed One, I do not make this offering for my own sake. Rather, through the roots of virtue from this offering of a pearl necklace and praise to the thus-gone, blessed, completely perfect Buddha, may all beings attain buddhahood, Blessed One. This is my intention, Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:1.507,id:UT22084-065-001-878}}}At that, the Blessed One smiled. As is a basic truth of the blessed buddhas, when the blessed Buddha smiled, light rays of various colors and hues—blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, and crystal-clear—emerged from the Blessed One’s mouth, illuminated the boundless expanse of world systems, and brought peace to beings tormented in the lower realms. After gratifying gods and humans, the light rays returned, circled the Blessed One many times, and descended into the crown of his head. The entire assembly also saw the light rays and experienced awe, delight, happiness, and bliss. They joined their palms, bowed while facing the Blessed One, and sat down. They wondered, “What prompted the Blessed One’s smile?”
{{milestone:{label:1.508,id:UT22084-065-001-879}}}The venerable Ānanda then rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe on one shoulder, and knelt down on his right knee. {{page:{number:179,id:UT22084-065-001-1401,folio:F.90.b}}} Facing the Blessed One, he joined his palms, bowed, and asked the Blessed One in verse about the meaning of his smile:

{{milestone:{label:1.520,id:UT22084-065-001-893}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha asked, “Honorable Subhūti, do you know who here will become a buddha?”
“Child of good family,” replied Subhūti, “I do not clearly see the qualities of those who will become buddhas.”

{{milestone:{label:1.522,id:UT22084-065-001-896}}}“Child of good family,” replied Subhūti, “the Blessed One prophesied that you would become a buddha, did he not?”
{{milestone:{label:1.523,id:UT22084-065-001-897}}}Nirārambha said, “Honorable Subhūti, the Blessed One said the words ‘become a buddha’ fully knowing what was meant. What meaning is it that is fully known to a thus-gone one? The thus-gone ones do not prophesy about bodhisattvas who aspire to awaken. The thus-gone ones prophesy about bodhisattvas who do not aspire to awaken. Therefore, the Blessed One, fully knowing what was meant, said ‘become a buddha’ in order to develop the roots of virtue of beings. {{page:{number:181,id:UT22084-065-001-1403,folio:F.91.b}}} What were you thinking of when you said ‘become a buddha’?”
{{milestone:{label:1.524,id:UT22084-065-001-898}}}“Child of good family,” replied Subhūti, “the conventions used by the Blessed One’s śrāvakas are the same conventions used in the world.”
{{milestone:{label:1.525,id:UT22084-065-001-899}}}“Honorable Subhūti, noble ones do not use worldly conventions,” countered Nirārambha. “Why? The conventions of the noble ones are true, while worldly conventions are false. Therefore, honorable Subhūti, it is not appropriate to speak to noble ones using false worldly conventions. Honorable Subhūti, worldly beings should be protected, but they are scared of the ultimate. Noble ones therefore compassionately set aside the authentic truth and use false conventions with foolish beings. They are not appropriate for noble ones. Noble ones take joy in the authentic truth, and therefore speak the truth with noble ones. What is the truth of the noble ones? Honorable Subhūti, complete awakening is the truth of the noble ones. All phenomena have the nature of awakening. This is the truth of the noble ones.”
{{milestone:{label:1.526,id:UT22084-065-001-900}}}Subhūti then asked, “Child of good family, is the truth of the noble ones not the four truths—the truth of suffering, the truth of origin, the truth of cessation, and the truth of the path?”
{{milestone:{label:1.527,id:UT22084-065-001-901}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha replied, “Honorable Subhūti, is suffering not compounded?”
“That is correct, suffering is compounded,” said Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:1.528,id:UT22084-065-001-903}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha then asked, “Honorable Subhūti, did not the Blessed One say that anything compounded is a false and deceptive phenomenon?”
“So he did, child of good family,” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:1.529,id:UT22084-065-001-905}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha then asked, “If suffering is compounded and thus false, what makes you think suffering is a truth of the noble ones?”
“Child of good family,” replied Subhūti, “suffering is compounded and thus false. {{page:{number:182,id:UT22084-065-001-1404,folio:F.92.a}}} Truth is knowing suffering.”
{{milestone:{label:1.530,id:UT22084-065-001-907}}}Nirārambha then asked, “If suffering is compounded, false, deceptive, and unreal, then how would knowing it be truly appropriate?
“Indeed, child of good family,” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:1.531,id:UT22084-065-001-909}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha then asked, “Honorable Subhūti, in what sense is your knowing of suffering a truth of the noble ones?”
“Child of good family,” replied Subhūti, “if cessation is uncompounded, how is it not the truth of the noble ones?”
{{milestone:{label:1.532,id:UT22084-065-001-911}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha then asked, “Honorable Subhūti, is cessation itself the truth of cessation, or the ceasing of some other phenomenon? Because of the cessation of what is it the truth of cessation?”
“Child of good family,” replied Subhūti, “it is called ‘the truth of cessation’ because of the cessation of suffering.”
{{milestone:{label:1.533,id:UT22084-065-001-913}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha then asked, “Did the elder Subhūti not say that suffering is a compounded, false, and deceptive phenomenon?”
“Indeed, child of good family,” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:1.534,id:UT22084-065-001-915}}}The bodhisattva Nirārambha then asked, “Honorable Subhūti, if there is no cessation for a phenomenon that is false and incorrect, in what sense does your suffering cease?”
Once that had been said, the venerable Subhūti said to the bodhisattva great being Nirārambha, “Child of good family, I rejoice in your confident eloquence. May all beings also attain your confident eloquence. Child of good family, what is the truth for bodhisattvas? What truth do they clearly comprehend?”
{{milestone:{label:1.535,id:UT22084-065-001-917}}}“Honorable Subhūti,” replied the bodhisattva Nirārambha, “there is no contradiction between any phenomena and the mode of the truth. Therefore, the clear comprehension of all phenomena is the clear comprehension of the truth. {{page:{number:183,id:UT22084-065-001-1405,folio:F.92.b}}} Honorable Subhūti, all phenomena arise dependently. The clear comprehension of dependent arising is the clear comprehension of the truth. All phenomena are empty. Understanding emptiness is the truth. The clear comprehension of emptiness is the clear comprehension of the truth. All phenomena are unarisen. Understanding nonarising is the truth. The clear comprehension of nonarising is the clear comprehension of the truth. Honorable Subhūti, when there is comprehension of the truth, no phenomena are established or rejected. Honorable Subhūti, the bodhisattvas’ clear comprehension of the truth does not involve any phenomena. This, honorable Subhūti, is the bodhisattvas’ clear comprehension of the truth.
{{milestone:{label:1.536,id:UT22084-065-001-918}}}“Honorable Subhūti, what we call ‘truth’ is another way of referring to the quality of being unchanging. Honorable Subhūti, even the slightest concept is mistaken, while being free of concepts is liberation. Honorable Subhūti, because the Blessed One said ‘become a buddha,’ you then said ‘easily achieve success.’ But, honorable Subhūti, the prophecy is not given to those who will easily achieve success; it is given to those who will not easily achieve success, to those for whom success does not exist. The prophecy is given to those who take no joy in success and feel no dejection in failure. The prophecy is given to those who do not leave saṃsāra behind while attaining nirvāṇa. The prophecy is given to those who do not leave the phenomena of ordinary people behind while reaching certainty. The prophecy is given to those who feel no joy when hearing the prophecy.”
“What you have understood is profound,” said Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:1.537,id:UT22084-065-001-920}}}“Honorable Subhūti,” said Nirārambha, “profound is the understanding of those who recognize their understanding upon realization.”
“It is hard to see this understanding,” said Subhūti.
“Honorable Subhūti,” said Nirārambha, “those who wish to can see it.”
“This understanding is difficult to realize,” {{page:{number:184,id:UT22084-065-001-1406,folio:F.93.a}}} said Subhūti.
“Honorable Subhūti,” said Nirārambha, “those who make no effort can.”
{{milestone:{label:1.538,id:UT22084-065-001-925}}}Subhūti asked, “Child of good family, who can apply this way?”
“This way of the Dharma will sound in the ears of those who honored many buddhas, who did not fail to generate roots of virtue, and who honored the manifestations of the buddhas,” replied Nirārambha.
{{milestone:{label:1.539,id:UT22084-065-001-927}}}Subhūti asked, “Child of good family, how are the buddhas honored?”
“They are served through one’s behavior,” replied Nirārambha.
{{milestone:{label:1.540,id:UT22084-065-001-929}}}Subhūti asked, “How do you know that one is maintaining correct behavior?”
“When one is not adversarial to beings,” replied Nirārambha.
{{milestone:{label:1.541,id:UT22084-065-001-931}}}Subhūti asked, “How is one not adversarial to beings?”
“Not giving up either great love or great compassion,” replied Nirārambha.
{{milestone:{label:1.542,id:UT22084-065-001-933}}}Subhūti asked, “What is the great love of bodhisattvas?”
“It is to give away one’s body, life, and roots of virtue to all beings without the expectation of reward,” replied Nirārambha.
{{milestone:{label:1.543,id:UT22084-065-001-935}}}Subhūti asked, “What is the great compassion of bodhisattvas?”
“It is to wish, from the very outset, for the awakening of all beings, not for one’s own,”{{note:{index:215,id:UT22084-065-001-937}}} replied Nirārambha.
{{milestone:{label:1.544,id:UT22084-065-001-938}}}Once this instruction had been explained, seventy-six thousand living beings developed the mind intent on unsurpassable, completely perfect awakening, and the minds of two hundred monks were freed from the contaminants without further clinging.
