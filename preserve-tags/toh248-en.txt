The Fourfold Accomplishments: The Bodhisattvas’ Prātimokṣa
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-066-006-48}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-066-006-206,folio:F.46.b}}} Homage to the Blessed Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Vulture Peak near Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks—Venerable Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, and others—who were all worthy ones, whose defilements were exhausted, who were without afflictions, and who had gained mastery. A great many bodhisattva great beings were also present. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-066-006-52}}}Then it happened that Venerable Śāriputra went before the Blessed One, bowed down at his feet, and sat to one side. While seated to one side, Venerable Śāriputra asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what are the deeds related to the aspects of the bodhisattvas’ truth? Blessed One, how do bodhisattvas speak truthfully and genuinely, thereby quickly awakening in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-066-006-53}}}The Blessed One replied to Venerable Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas have four qualities they speak truthfully and genuinely, and will quickly awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. What are these four? 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-066-006-54}}}“Śāriputra, in their pursuit of all virtuous qualities, noble sons or noble daughters generate the mind set on unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and then practice the application of diligence. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-066-006-207,folio:F.47.a}}} Śāriputra, as an analogy, when a man wishes to survey a city, he first generates effort regarding what is to be done for the city. Śāriputra, he then hopes that the city will develop, and that people will come to live there. Wishing to settle in that city, he comes to know all its places based on genuine insight.{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-066-006-55}}} Similarly, Śāriputra, in their pursuit of all virtuous qualities, bodhisattvas practice the application of diligence and comprehend all qualities.{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-066-006-56}}} Śāriputra, this way of quickly awakening in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood is the first aspect of the bodhisattvas’ truth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-066-006-57}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who study the Dharma with earnest application will quickly ripen virtuous qualities. As an analogy, Śāriputra, when a doctor prescribes medicine to someone suffering from an illness, the person who carefully follows the doctor’s instructions will quickly recover from that illness. Why? Because that person has properly and carefully followed the doctor’s prescription. Similarly, Śāriputra, the virtuous qualities of bodhisattvas who study the Dharma with earnest application will quickly ripen. Śāriputra, this way of quickly awakening in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood is the second aspect of the bodhisattvas’ truth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-066-006-58}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas do not cling to any phenomenon in the slightest while they perceive all phenomena as being alien. {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-066-006-59}}} Why? Because they seek out the path while thinking, ‘Since danger arises from appropriation, I perceive danger in all phenomena. Perceiving danger, I do not rely on them. If they are unreliable, how will I be free? {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-066-006-208,folio:F.47.b}}} How will I be happy?’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-066-006-60}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas seek out the path and seek out the well-spoken teachings in the four directions while thinking, ‘If one is completely enveloped by birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and distress, how will there be freedom in unexcelled and perfect buddhahood? How will there be happiness?’ Śāriputra, this way of quickly awakening in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood is the third aspect of the bodhisattvas’ truth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-066-006-61}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas become benefactors, and since they are totally unafraid of and untainted by the phenomena of suffering, they maintain constant diligence. They arouse the determination that thinks, ‘I will clear away whatever suffering, unhappiness, and distress that arises in sentient beings in order to bring them to peace.’ They practice the application of diligence while thinking, ‘I will induce in all sentient beings the same experience of uncontaminated bliss that has arisen in me.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-066-006-62}}}“When they apply diligence, they do not conceive of profit. As an analogy, Śāriputra, consider people travelling through a wasteland in the middle of the summer, where there are no humans passing through, no trees or water, and the sun shines down, scorching and burning the ground. If a great river were to appear, flowing in front of those people, it would be a marvelous sight for them. Similarly, Śāriputra, for the sake of all sentient beings, bodhisattvas follow such a path that brings an end to suffering. Even if, after ten million eons, bodhisattvas who follow that path {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-066-006-209,folio:F.48.a}}} give rise to a single thought of desire for the relief of a bit of rest, they should encourage themselves, saying, ‘There are many in my care; I will acknowledge my faults for the sake of all sentient beings.’ {{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-066-006-63}}} Śāriputra, this way of quickly awakening in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood is the fourth aspect of the bodhisattvas’ truth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-066-006-64}}}“Śāriputra, what is meant by awakening in a perfect manner? It is said to be awakening in a perfect manner since it is the knowledge of what has not been known, and being intent on the phenomena that are known. {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-066-006-65}}} It is also said to be unexcelled, since not even the slightest particle of any phenomenon is left out or passed over by the thus-gone ones. Therefore, they are said to have gone thus and to have reached the other shore. 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-066-006-66}}}“Śāriputra, what is meant by perfect buddhahood? Phenomena are known by a mind that is balanced, clear, and undisturbed. The knowledge of the sameness of all phenomena and of the lack of difference in all phenomena is said to be perfect buddhahood. 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-066-006-67}}}“Śāriputra, the diligence of bodhisattvas endowed with those four qualities is insuperable. Untainted by any affliction, they will awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-066-006-68}}}“Śāriputra, because this fourfold accomplishment of the bodhisattvas’ qualities is known, seen, realized, attained, and actualized by the thus-gone ones, it is awakening in a perfect manner. Because bodhisattvas do not fall from those states and perfect all aspects of accomplishment, they will awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-066-006-210,folio:F.48.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-066-006-69}}}“Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have four qualities will be praised.{{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-066-006-70}}} What are these four? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas are not excessively proud—they have set out to annihilate pride. They have no attachments—they have set out to abandon attachment. They have no anger—they delight in cultivating loving-kindness. They are without delusion—they possess the strength of insight. They hew closely to insight. They act insightfully. They are masters of insight. Insight motivates their renunciation. They have set out to abandon the web of delusion. They have set out to overcome darkness and gloom. They are powerful and dedicated to the causes of insight. They are certain to achieve insight. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have these first qualities will be praised.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-066-006-71}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas strive to liberate sentient beings. As an analogy, Śāriputra, if parents were to see their beloved, attractive, and pleasing only son sent by the king to the place of his execution, they would wail and lament, ‘Oh no! Our only son! Alas! Our only son! How can we abandon him?’ Similarly, Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas with perfect intentions see any sentient being engaged in negative actions, compassion will be born in them, and they will exclaim, ‘Oh no! Sentient beings with faulty insight stray from their correct livelihood!’ Śāriputra, those who think about guarding others should guard themselves. Śāriputra, because bodhisattvas have such a desire to benefit, they will not commit a single negative action, even to save their life. Śāriputra, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-066-006-211,folio:F.49.a}}} bodhisattvas who have these two qualities will be praised. 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-066-006-72}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas devotedly seek out the Dharma, devotedly uphold the Dharma, and devotedly practice giving the gift of the Dharma. Śāriputra, how do bodhisattvas devotedly seek out the Dharma? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who wish for the Dharma pay respect to preceptors and teachers while thinking, ‘There is no jewel in the world I would not give away for it! There is nothing I would not do to honor it with my body! There is no distance I would not walk for it! There is no verbal act I would not perform for it! Why? Because the jewel of Dharma is the most precious jewel of all, so I will abandon all other jewels to seek out the jewel of Dharma and uphold it. Why? Because the Dharma severs all fetters; it severs birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and unhappiness!’ Thinking in this way, they arouse the thought that it is precious. They arouse the thought that it is difficult to find. They arouse the thought that it is medicine. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas seek out the Dharma while thinking, ‘Because this Dharma cures the ills of all sentient beings, I should seek this Dharma so as to to cure the ills of all sentient beings.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-066-006-73}}}“Śāriputra, how do bodhisattvas arouse the thought that Dharma is priceless and devotedly uphold it? For the sake of a single four-line verse, they would give away heaps of jewels the size of Mount Meru, and they would not perceive any difficulty in that. Yet they perceive the difficulty in upholding that single four-line verse. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-066-006-212,folio:F.49.b}}} For the sake of a single word of the Dharma, they would give away the trichiliocosm filled up to the pinnacle of existence with the seven types of jewels, and they would not perceive any difficulty that. Yet they perceive the difficulty in upholding that single word of the Dharma. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas uphold the Dharma with this kind of respect and honor. This, Śāriputra, is a marvel of the bodhisattvas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-066-006-74}}}“Śāriputra, what do you think—is it out of concern for their life, for the sake of their life, that they would give away those heaps of jewels?”
“No, Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-066-006-76}}}“Śāriputra,” continued the Blessed One, “for the sake of a single word of the Dharma, bodhisattva great beings who wish for the Dharma may cast themselves from the world of Brahmā or enter the trichiliocosm when it is completely filled with fire, and they would not perceive any difficulty in that. Yet they perceive the difficulty in upholding that single word of the Dharma. Śāriputra, this is how bodhisattvas devotedly uphold the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-066-006-77}}}“Śāriputra, how do bodhisattvas devotedly practice giving the gift of the Dharma? Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas practice giving the gift of the Dharma, they are not concerned with material things. Holy beings do not practice giving the gift of the Dharma while thinking, ‘Through my generosity, I will acquire robes, alms, bedding, medicine, or goods,’ or ‘I will at least be complimented for my generosity.’ Rather, they practice generosity while thinking, ‘I practice generosity to free sentient beings from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and distress.’ {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-066-006-213,folio:F.50.a}}} Śāriputra, holy beings practice giving the gift of the Dharma with such thoughts and in such a manner. 
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-066-006-78}}}“Śāriputra, if someone said to a bodhisattva, {{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-066-006-79}}} ‘If you offered me your body, I would accept it from you as a Dharma gift.’ Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have such a wish to benefit would reply, ‘Partake of the flesh of the best parts of my limbs and body parts! Uphold this Dharma which brings an end to desire!’ Śāriputra, bodhisattvas would not perceive any difficulty in acting in this manner. Yet they perceive the difficulty of relying on the gift of the Dharma. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas practice giving the gift of the Dharma with this kind of devotion, they uphold the Dharma with this kind of devotion, and they seek out the Dharma with this kind of devotion. 
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-066-006-80}}}“Śāriputra, sentient beings who pursue the Dharma with such devotion are rare indeed. Śāriputra, sentient beings who uphold the Dharma with such devotion are rare indeed. Śāriputra, sentient beings who practice giving the Dharma with such devotion are rare indeed. Such a rarity is a marvel, and those bodhisattvas are to be praised by the world with its gods. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have these three qualities will be praised.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-066-006-81}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas observe in themselves the arising of desire, they look for the ground from which this desire has arisen. When they look carefully, they cannot find that ground. They cannot find the place whence that desire has arisen, whose desire has arisen, the means by which that desire has arisen,{{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-066-006-82}}} for whom it has arisen, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-066-006-214,folio:F.50.b}}} or how it has arisen. As that desire cannot be found, they do not engage in negative actions motivated by desire. Rather, their positive qualities increase, and they are not criticized—they are praised. Consequently, they are praised by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, humans, nonhumans, buddhas, and śrāvakas. They do not affirm, and they do not observe, any phenomenon. They see that all phenomena are empty like space, and they become intensely dedicated to the awakening of the blessed buddhas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-066-006-83}}}“When they see worldly people fixated on wrong views, they are without anger and ill will. Established in supreme patience, they endeavor in generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and insight, and they bring sentient beings to maturity. Why? Because, when ill will is present, aggression increases. When aggression increases, angry words are spoken to others, and this creates nonvirtuous karma. As a result, unfortunate existences will come to be. 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-066-006-84}}}“Śāriputra, patient bodhisattvas act with endurance. Why? Because by not apprehending any difference whatsoever between endurable and unendurable phenomena, they have compassion for sentient beings who do not know otherwise. They have compassion for sentient beings who completely criticize them, who completely abuse them, and who completely deprecate them. This shows that they have cultivated great love and virtuous qualities. This kind of patience—the attainment of supreme patience—is known as the concordant patience. Through their great compassion, {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-066-006-215,folio:F.51.a}}} bodhisattvas awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and they then teach the Dharma to sentient beings. Undertaking difficulties and hardships, they attain supreme patience, unimpeded wisdom and vision, undivided wisdom and vision, and unattached wisdom and vision. Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas have those four qualities they will be praised. 
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-066-006-85}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have four qualities will remember their past lives. What are these four? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas’ acts accord with their words, and their words accord with their acts. They abandon, renounce, and rid themselves of aggression, and they rely on wisdom. As an analogy, Śāriputra, a pit filled with burning embers is extinguished by a great mass of water. Similarly, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas abandon and rid themselves of aggression, and they rely on wisdom. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have this first quality will remember their past lives. 
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-066-006-86}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who pursue learning and all virtuous qualities never forsake what is essential. They possess much masterful learning.{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-066-006-87}}} Wherever they go, their wishes are fulfilled.{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-066-006-88}}} They establish others at the level of erudition, and they cause them to understand the Dharma correctly. At the time of death, they will remain mindful of the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-066-006-89}}}“As an analogy, Śāriputra, when people set out traveling with an attitude of playfulness and delight, they may get hungry. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-066-006-216,folio:F.51.b}}} However, if they later remind themselves of their playfulness and delight, the thought of their prior state will dispel their hunger. Similarly, Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas are pressed by the feeling of impending death, they readily accept it with a mind turned toward the Dharma, and they become alert. If they enter a mother’s womb and remain there with this alertness, they will retain their memory. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have these two qualities will remember their past lives. 
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-066-006-90}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas guard their speech carefully. They do not criticize others. They do not behave aggressively toward others, calling them ‘ignorant,’ ‘deluded,’ ‘conceited,’ ‘blind,’ or ‘crippled.’ Instead, they provide aggressive beings with relief, patience, and harmony. They delight them with the Dharma, they establish them in mindfulness, and they speak to them sincerely. They give them the gift of fearlessness, saying, ‘Please come, you are welcome here. Do not be afraid! Do not be afraid!’ They bring relief to those beings, and they instill confidence, patience, and harmony in them. They are motivated to act when they see sentient beings’ confused behavior. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have these three qualities will remember their past lives. 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-066-006-91}}}“Furthermore, Śāriputra, such bodhisattvas, while thoroughly transcending virtuous qualities, will possess virtuous qualities. They dwell in them, and also firmly establish others in them. With devotion they seek out the Dharma and teach it extensively to others. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have these four qualities will remember their past lives. 
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-066-006-92}}}“By remembering their past lives, bodhisattvas will attain five qualities. {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-066-006-217,folio:F.52.a}}} What are these five? Adherence to and perfect memory of the teachings they have heard previously, sharp insight, supreme recollection, insight, and avoidance of negative actions—even at the cost of their life. As soon as they are born, they will attain these five qualities. 
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-066-006-93}}}“Śāriputra, four qualities are not present in bodhisattvas. What are these four? Bodhisattvas are without deceit. Bodhisattvas are without miserliness. Bodhisattvas are without jealousy and slander. Bodhisattvas never lose heart, thinking, ‘I am unable to awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.’ “Śāriputra, concerning those people in whom these four qualities are present, wise ones will know, ‘Oh! These people are frauds! They are flatterers! They waste the Dharma! They are wracked by afflictions! They are obsessed with worldly things! They just want more and more food and clothes! They are thieves within the world!’ Why? Because, Śāriputra, such people lack four things, and what are the four signs of this? Partaking of increasing amounts of food, perceiving themselves as supreme, teaching ostentatiously, and when it comes to undertaking the deeds of a bodhisattva, not applying themselves to develop a single bodhisattva quality. 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-066-006-94}}}“Śāriputra, what are the qualities in which bodhisattvas should exert themselves? They are perfect discipline, unbroken discipline, unspoiled mindfulness, liberality, the strength of patience, the lack of aggression, the absence of harm, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-066-006-218,folio:F.52.b}}} erudition, generosity, self-control, restraint, never indulging in sensual pleasures, never indulging in any kind of ill will, swift renunciation, the absence of slander, the lack of aggression, {{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-066-006-95}}} the adoption of what is virtuous, behaving wisely, love for all sentient beings, reconciling those in conflict, acting as bridges over saṃsāra’s mire, giving Dharma discourses, knowing the particular strengths of patience, and relying on the ripening of actions. Śāriputra, those who exert themselves in these qualities will certainly become bodhisattvas. Śāriputra, these are the qualities in which bodhisattvas exert themselves. Śāriputra, you should know that those who lack the qualities in which bodhisattvas exert themselves are frauds destined for the lower realms. 
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-066-006-96}}}“Śāriputra, four qualities lead bodhisattvas to the accomplishment of unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. What are these four? They are the Dharma and the knowledge of the Dharma, generosity and the knowledge of generosity, the knowledge of the duties of a caretaker, {{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-066-006-97}}} and the knowledge of the pursuit of erudition. 
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-066-006-98}}}“Śāriputra, what are the Dharma teachings of the bodhisattvas? The Dharma teachings of the bodhisattvas are the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four bases of miracles, the five powers, the five strengths, the seven factors of awakening, the eightfold path of the noble ones,{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-066-006-99}}} the absence of attachment, the absence of anger, the absence of ignorance, and the path of the ten virtuous actions. 
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-066-006-100}}}“What is the knowledge of the Dharma teachings? The knowledge of the Dharma teachings consists in practicing those teachings properly—not incorrectly—with generosity, self-control, and restraint. {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-066-006-219,folio:F.53.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-066-006-101}}}“What is generosity? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas give away everything they have. They give away their arms, their legs, their hands and feet, their nose, their head, their limbs and body parts, their sons, their daughters, their spouses, their lives, their wealth, their happiness, their body, their material possessions, their lands, their jewels, and all their belongings. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who give such gifts approach unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. 
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-066-006-102}}}“What is the knowledge of generosity? It consists in giving alms at the appropriate time and giving appropriate offerings. It consists in giving donations of robes, alms, bedding, medicine, and requisites to monks. Śāriputra, wise bodhisattvas always turn away from inferior forms of generosity such as giving at inappropriate times, giving what is not suitable, giving liquor, giving poison, giving what is harmful, giving what is regrettable, giving weapons, giving what has been stolen, giving contemptuously, refusing to give with one’s own hands, giving while averting one’s face, giving motivated by desire, giving unpleasant gifts, improper gifts, inferior gifts, gifts mixed with poison, giving in ways that lead to harm, giving in order to profit, giving in order to inspire lasting fear, {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-066-006-220,folio:F.53.b}}} giving in ways that jeopardize awakening, giving a hangman’s noose, giving deludedly, giving in order to be served, and giving with fear. 
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-066-006-103}}}“Śāriputra, under no circumstances do the wise practice or involve themselves with those inferior forms of generosity. Bodhisattvas who practice or involve themselves with them should not be called bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas who are endowed with bodhisattva qualities but who have spoiled their generosity are actually bereft of bodhisattva qualities. 
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-066-006-104}}}“Śāriputra, how should bodhisattvas who strive in the factors of awakening after having renounced their homes practice generosity? What should they give? How much should they give? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who strive in the factors of awakening after having renounced their homes should remain bound by the prātimokṣa vows. Their conduct, personal associations, and behavior should be perfect. They should train by seeing danger in even the subtlest misdeeds, by engaging in pure physical, verbal, and mental actions, and by adopting a pure livelihood. They should earnestly apply themselves to the instructions they receive, to the practice of recitation, and to dwelling in the remote places. They should teach extensively what they have learned and understood to others. They should be propagators and benefactors of the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-066-006-105}}}“Śāriputra, compared to householder bodhisattvas who fill buddhafields as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges with the seven types of jewels and then offer these to the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas, {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-066-006-221,folio:F.54.a}}} renunciant bodhisattvas who teach a single four-line verse produce much more merit. Śāriputra, the Thus-Gone One did not authorize renunciants to practice the giving of material things. Why? Because, Śāriputra, after having gone forth, for inconceivably countless eons they should not think about being invited to feasts where one is offered householders’ or renunciants’ robes or alms. Instead, they should maintain devotion and admiration for the Dharma alone. Why? Because, Śāriputra, my disciples {{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-066-006-106}}} should be rich in Dharma, not rich in material things. 
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-066-006-107}}}“Śāriputra, if whatever alms placed in their alms bowls are received in accord with the Dharma and by means of the Dharma, they should share them with their fellow practitioners of pure conduct. If someone comes along and asks for alms bowls or for robes, if they possess more than the three robes prescribed by the Buddha, they should give them away. If they have fewer than the three robes, they should not give away those robes that they rely upon to maintain pure conduct. Why? Because the Thus-Gone One has said that the three robes should not be given away. Śāriputra, if bodhisattvas prioritize the one who asks by giving away the three robes, they do not keep the practice of having few desires. Therefore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who renounce their homes should immerse themselves in the Dharma and exert themselves in it. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas should cultivate love for all sentient beings at every single moment. This is what is meant by the knowledge of generosity. 
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-066-006-108}}}“To what extent, Śāriputra, should one be known as a caretaker bodhisattva? Bodhisattvas should be caretakers in accord with the Dharma and caretakers of the thus-gone ones’ stūpas. They should be respectful toward preceptors and teachers. {{page:{number:17,id:UT22084-066-006-222,folio:F.54.b}}} They should practice the application of diligence in such a way that, until the very end of their life, they dispel sloth and torpor. Śāriputra, these are the duties of caretaker bodhisattvas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-066-006-109}}}“Śāriputra, what is the knowledge of the pursuit of erudition? Śāriputra, you should know that those who do not strive for erudition after having set their minds on the awakening of the buddhas are not bodhisattvas who speak truthfully. Śāriputra, one cannot awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood through mere words. Rather, it is through insight that one can awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. 
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-066-006-110}}}“Where does insight come from? Insight comes from erudition. Śāriputra, this is why you must gain direct experience and knowledge. Seeking to sow doubts in erudite beings who follow the Bodhisattva Vehicle, wicked māras will create obstacles to the awakening of bodhisattvas who benefit sentient beings. Śāriputra, when bodhisattvas do not strive for erudition after having set their minds on awakening, this is the doing of wicked māras. Therefore, Śāriputra, those who wish to know all the deeds of the māras should practice the application of diligence. They should not prioritize words. They should understand the ways of the wise, and the ways that are renowned within the entire world. Thus Śāriputra, through diligence and discipline that rise above all worlds, they will awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood . 
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-066-006-111}}}“Śāriputra, {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-066-006-223,folio:F.55.a}}} those who do not establish these states with great striving and perseverance will drift away from the ten powers of a thus-gone one, from the wisdom that rises above all worlds, and from their aspirations. Therefore, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas should speak words that please all sentient beings—they should not speak for their own benefit. Bodhisattvas should not practice inferior types of diligence. 
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-066-006-112}}}“Śāriputra, one out of a thousand are accomplished, or none are. Śāriputra, one out of ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand, forty thousand, fifty thousand, or ten billion are accomplished, or none are. Why? Because, Śāriputra, it is difficult for those who abide by this bodhisattva conduct to reach emancipation.
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-066-006-113}}}“Therefore, Śāriputra, those who strive for unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should form this resolve: ‘For the sake of all sentient beings, I will endure what is hard to endure and bear what is hard to bear. I will joyfully exert myself to seek out the Dharma—not to seek out pleasure.’ Why? Because those who seek out the Dharma seek out wisdom. When they acquire what they wished for, they do not become conceited or pompous. Therefore, sentient beings who follow the Bodhisattva Vehicle should prioritize insight, not pleasure. Śāriputra, this is how bodhisattvas should exert themselves in giving the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-066-006-114}}}“Śāriputra, how should bodhisattvas seek out the knowledge of erudition? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas should send four persons in the four directions, telling them, ‘Go, and spread the excellent teaching that you have heard.’ They should also send four other persons by telling them, {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-066-006-224,folio:F.55.b}}} ‘You should go forth and act as caretakers and nurses for them.’ Śāriputra, bodhisattvas should pervade the four directions with thoughts of love and focus their minds on pursuing the Dharma. They should go wherever the Dharma can be heard. Śāriputra, this is how bodhisattvas should seek out the Dharma. This is the knowledge of seeking out erudition. Śāriputra, these four qualities lead bodhisattvas to the accomplishment of unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. 
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-066-006-115}}}“Śāriputra, in ancient times, there was a bodhisattva named Wise Diligence. At that time, there was a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha named Sujāta. After he had passed into parinirvāṇa, but while his teachings remained, the bodhisattva Wise Diligence was travelling by means of prostration to his stūpa, when he arrived before the Bodhi tree. When he saw the Bodhi tree, he wept uncontrollably and exclaimed, ‘The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha awakened in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood while staying here. In this place, that blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha subdued Māra, his armies, and their mounts. For the sake of this lion’s throne, the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha underwent hardships for many hundreds of thousands of eons. The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha sat here cross-legged for seven days. While the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha was seated here, {{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-066-006-225,folio:F.56.a}}} many trillions of gods prostrated to the Blessed One upon seeing him; this was truly an excellent attainment for them. Someday, I too will awaken in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood!’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-066-006-116}}}“For eight days and nights, he wept uncontrollably at the foot of the Bodhi tree. As he did not partake of food or drink during that time, the gods of the pure abodes approached him and said, ‘Do not torment yourself like this. Instead, seek out the qualities of the Buddha.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-066-006-117}}}“He asked, ‘Do you know the qualities of the Buddha?’ 
“ ‘We do not know them,’ they replied. ‘However, we know that this body has been sustained by rice and gruel; make some effort to feed yourself! Do not hasten your own death!’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-066-006-119}}}“ ‘My body is weak and I lack higher perception,’ he said. ‘Yet where should I go? This is the very place where I should die!’ He then wept for seven days and nights, shouting, ‘Let death come!’ Śāriputra, he then maintained that diligence for six hundred million eons. Śāriputra, after another two hundred fifty million eons, that bodhisattva awakened in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. After he awakened in a perfect manner to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, he ripened a trillion sentient beings to the level where their progress toward unexcelled and perfect buddhahood was irreversible. The span of time this took place is unfathomable, and his community of śrāvakas was also immeasurable and unfathomable. 
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-066-006-120}}}“Śāriputra, why was he called Wise Diligence? Because he always exerted himself for emancipation.

What are these four? Śāriputra, bodhisattvas receive many teachings. They retain and accumulate teachings. They respect practitioners of pure conduct who are elders, those who are novices, and those in between. When asked, they indicate the path with the right hand, saying, ‘This is the path. This is the path,’ and they exert themselves in teaching the Dharma.

Thus, they should show respect to practitioners of pure conduct. When in their presence, they should not disparage them, speak, wash their own feet, use their tooth sticks, or spit. They should not make loud noises, speak without being asked, interrupt them, or leave without being bidden. They should not think about the past or future, they should not say a word, they should not engage in random discussions, and they should not engage in base talk.

They should be wary or respectful of those who are angry at them, who accuse them of being wrong, who pose threats to their life, or create hindrances to their observance of pure conduct. They should even befriend them with fond words. They should perceive those from whom they receive instructions and those who engage in recitation as their teachers, and they should respect them.
