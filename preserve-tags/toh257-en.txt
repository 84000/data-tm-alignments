Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in the Veṇuvana at the Kalandakanivāpa near Rājagṛha, surrounded and attended by an innumerable, limitless, and indescribable number of bodhisattva great beings who had arrived from countless other buddha realms of the ten directions. He was also surrounded and attended by an innumerable, limitless, and indescribable number of great hearers who had gathered there from different buddha realms of the ten directions. In the same way, an innumerable, limitless, and indescribable number of other beings who had arrived there from the various buddha realms of the ten directions—Śakra, Lord Brahmā, the rulers of the gods, the rulers of the nāgas, the rulers of the yakṣas, the rulers of the gandharvas, the rulers of the asuras, the rulers of the garuḍas, the rulers of the kinnaras, and the rulers of the mahoragas—filled all the pathways on the ground and in the sky throughout the entire buddha realm of Sahā. There also arrived an innumerable and limitless number of different gods from the desire and form realms, of nāgas, yakṣas, and rākṣasas, and of asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas. Sitting in silence, they looked up at the Blessed One as he revealed how bodhisattva conduct quickly brings perfection and manifests like space and as he gave teachings on the mindfulness of breathing, which is the gateway to immortality, and the sublime states. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-066-015-33,folio:F.92.a}}} They filled all the pathways on the ground and in the sky throughout the entire buddha realm of Sahā.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-066-015-34}}}Still not satisfied by the teachings of the Blessed One’s Dharma rain, they remained with their palms joined together, staring at the Blessed One. They beheld him like sick persons seeing the doctor, or like beings engulfed in darkness seeing a source of light, or like beings carried off by a river looking at the riverbank, or like afflicted beings looking at a refuge from their suffering. In that way, filling all the pathways on the ground and in the sky throughout the entire buddha realm of Sahā, the bodhisattva great beings and the hearers as well as Lord Śakra and everyone else up to the lords of the mahoragas, the different gods from the desire and form realms, and the various humans and nonhuman beings were sitting silently with their palms joined together, looking at the Blessed One, the righteous King of the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-066-015-35}}}Present at that time was a mahābrahmā named Glorious Blazing Lotus. He had generated roots of virtue under many buddhas and would no longer regress on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. He had also thoroughly trained in love by observing phenomena. This mahābrahmā Glorious Blazing Lotus then stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Bowing down with his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One, with these verses he supplicated him to expound the Dharma:
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-066-015-36}}}“You have reached far and possess a swift course.
Dedicated to exhaustion, you are immutable and luminous.
You generate all forms of realization, your speech is utterly peaceful, 
And you are an expert in the ways of the stars.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-066-015-37}}}“You master the mindfulness of breathing,
You are endowed with the four sublime states,
And you cause sentient beings to abandon the destinies of rebirth
In a way that purifies the three realms. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-066-015-38,folio:F.92.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-066-015-39}}}“You possess the knowledge of the single mode,
You eliminate the doubts of tens of thousands of gods and humans,
You have attained goodness, you have crossed the flood,
And you are endowed with the swift knowledge that leads to happiness.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-066-015-40}}}“Your awakened conduct and buddha qualities are manifest,
And you have conquered the entirety of the suffering of those beings with agitated minds 
Who are blind, engulfed in darkness,
And carried away by the river of desire.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-066-015-41}}}“Lord of humankind, you manifest compassion for those who have not studied 
And for those who are bereft of virtue and separated from skilled teachers.
Please let us hear about the Dharma of sameness; 
Explain how to pass beyond birth and sever saṃsāra!
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-066-015-42}}}“Great sage, you have crossed the river of birth; please speak with compassion!
Due to their distorted minds, beings will wander for many lifetimes 
On those paths that are webs of craving and contain the roots of afflictions;
Please sever them all!
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-066-015-43}}}“Victor, please tell us about the defects of craving,
So that our suffering is pacified along with our six senses and our minds.
Great sage, in order for beings to be free from craving and its causes
And from the abundance of their torments,
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-066-015-44}}}“Please expound to us, out of your affection,
The Dharma that dries up the river of craving,
Swiftly leads to happiness and immortality,
And eliminates craving!”
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-066-015-45}}}The Blessed One replied to the mahābrahmā Glorious Blazing Lotus:
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-066-015-46}}}“Those who have practiced the perfections in the past
And will practice them in the future
Should never delight 
In the teachings of the hearers.
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-066-015-47}}}“There is no other downfall besides that, 
To corrupt the teaching of the buddhas.
Yet the mind engages repeatedly,
Again and again, in such duality.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-066-015-48}}}“By abandoning the three types of teachings—
Those associated with aggression, 
The teaching of the hearers, and conditioned awakening{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-066-015-49}}}—
One will perfect the qualities of the buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-066-015-50}}}“Those beings, born in one of the four ways,
Who have arrived in this buddha realm
Are all free from indulging in desire,
And all of them have attained insight into repulsiveness.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-066-015-51}}}“The wise beings present here {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-066-015-52,folio:F.93.a}}}
Who follow the path to supreme awakening,
Who exert themselves and are well trained 
In retention and patience,
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-066-015-53}}}“Whose six sense doors are restrained,
And who have mastered their senses
By applying mindfulness cross-legged
Will be the future thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-066-015-54}}}“They will also perfect the seven riches. 
If I explain the way of repulsiveness here,
Then the basis for all, the constant that binds beings,
Will be severed.
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-066-015-55}}}“I have relinquished miserliness regarding the Dharma,
Yet, in order to protect beings, I have not explained this.
Still, for the sake of awakening,
Bodhisattvas will never give up this attitude.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-066-015-56}}}“The buddhas of the ten directions
Have subsisted on this earth and blessed it
As they declared,
‘This Dharma must remain for a long time!’
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-066-015-57}}}“Likewise, you should frolic in this realm
And revel in the acceptances.
With restraint you should also
Remain here for a long time! 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-066-015-58}}}“I shall expound the vehicle of the hearers;
I shall explain that beings must be liberated from attachment
And that the aggregates, the elements, 
And the sense sources are empty.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-066-015-59}}}“I shall expound the thirteen aspects of tranquility
As well as special insight,
So that sentient beings bound by the tight fetters of desire 
May become pure.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-066-015-60}}}“I shall explain the four truths of the hearers
Out of affection for sentient beings,
To ensure that the Dharma teachings
Endure forever and remain undefiled.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-066-015-61}}}“The hearers are tamed by the truths;
I shall free them from the ocean of saṃsāra.
Only at a later point shall I teach you 
All the practices of the bodhisattvas.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-066-015-62}}}At that moment, all the beings present throughout the entire buddha realm of Sahā thought, “Alas, the Thus-Gone One will now give a hearers’ discourse. He will not give a discourse related to the Great Vehicle!”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-066-015-63}}}All the bodhisattvas thought to themselves, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-066-015-64,folio:F.93.b}}} “O, the Thus-Gone One wishes us to withdraw into meditative seclusion, to ensure that we subsist on the earth in this buddha realm; to ensure that the way of the Dharma remains for a long time into the future; to ensure that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted in this buddha realm; to ensure that in the future the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans who lack faith generate faith; to ensure that those among them who have faith develop it further and further; to ensure that those beings who strive for the Dharma, who abide by the Dharma, who possess a wealth of qualities, and who are endowed with the scent of discipline gain happiness, remain free from harm, and perfect the happiness of emancipation; to ensure that, by all means, this buddha realm becomes saturated with qualities; to ensure that all the other buddha realms of the ten directions are also worthy of such a saturation; and to ensure that the masters receive reverence and respect. O, we must now fulfill the wish of the Thus-Gone One! We must ensure that we all sit cross-legged upon this earth and abide by our various individual acceptances, dhāraṇīs, absorptions, and practices replete with the most excellent aspects!”
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-066-015-65}}}Then all the bodhisattva great beings who had reached emancipation over the course of a hundred eons, who had reached the ten levels, who abided by the acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, who were endowed with the eighteen unique qualities of the buddhas and were skilled in the wisdom that does not depend upon anything else, and who had reached fearlessness sat cross-legged upon the earth, and thus they settled within their individual acceptances, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-066-015-66,folio:F.94.a}}} dhāraṇīs, and absorptions replete with the most excellent aspects.
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-066-015-67}}}At that moment, in accordance with the strength of that merit and through the power of that concordant cause, light started to radiate from the bodies of those great bodhisattvas who were settled in equipoise and from the bodies of those great bodhisattvas who were absorbed in concentration. Those lights were like the light of lamps. Some of those lights were equal to the light emitted by shooting stars; some were equal to the light emitted by Śakra, some were equal to the light emitted by Brahmā, the lord of the Sahā world, and some were equal to the light emitted by the moon. Some were equal to the light emitted by the sun, some were equal to the light emitted by two suns, some were equal to the light emitted by three suns, some were equal to the light emitted by five suns, and some were equal to the light emitted by a thousand suns. From the bodies of some of those bodhisattvas radiated light equal to the light emitted by a trillion suns. This far-reaching, brilliant light, which had never been seen or heard of before anywhere in this entire buddha realm of Sahā, pervaded the world. From their bodies radiated a light that brought the most supreme form of bliss to the bodies and minds of sentient beings and provided delight and satisfaction. This light completely pacified all diseases, completely pacified all unwholesome views, completely pacified all kinds of physical depravity, completely pacified all types of hunger and thirst, completely pacified all desires, and completely pacified all forms of aggression, fear, affliction, and bondage. In this buddha realm, this light completely pacified all the fears associated with the suffering experienced in the prison of the three realms.
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-066-015-68}}}At that time, all those sentient beings—who were inclined toward the Buddha and the Dharma and skilled in delighting in the qualities of the Saṅgha—were seated in this buddha realm. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-066-015-69,folio:F.94.b}}} At the same time, this buddha realm became visible, in a radiant, clear, and brilliant manner, from as many buddha realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Ganges—whether those realms were empty of buddhas or not, whether they were pure or impure. This buddha realm had the radiance, clarity, and brilliance of a hundred thousand moons rising in the darkness of the night. In that way, this buddha realm of Sahā appeared in the most radiant, clear, and brilliant manner in buddha realms of the ten directions as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges—whether those realms were empty of buddhas or not, whether they were pure or impure. 
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-066-015-70}}}Then, through the power of the Buddha, all bodhisattva great beings present in those different buddha realms who had reached emancipation over the course of a hundred eons, who were endowed with the eighteen unique qualities of the buddhas and skilled in the wisdom that does not depend on anything else, and who had reached fearlessness departed from those places, entered this buddha realm in a single instant of thought, and sat cross-legged upon the earth in their respective ways of abiding. The exact same lights radiated from the bodies of each of those beings who exerted themselves in virtuous endeavors, who had developed the power of virtue, and who were endowed with the causes and conditions of fearlessness.
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-066-015-71}}}Surrounded by his saṅgha of monks, the Blessed One then said to the great hearers, “Look at the power of the domain of concentration! Having used their blessings to overpower the domains of all the māras and nāgas, all the thus-gone ones of the past engaged with this entire buddha realm of Sahā to ensure that the way of the Dharma and the lineage of the Three Jewels remain uninterrupted and illuminated here. {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-066-015-72,folio:F.95.a}}} Similarly, a countless and limitless number of bodhisattva great beings—as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges—who revel in the domains of concentration and higher perception are now engaging with this great earth in this buddha realm of Sahā to ensure that the Dharma way remains for a long time and is illuminated; to ensure that the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans who lack faith develop faith; to ensure that those among them who have faith develop it further and further; to ensure that sentient beings who strive for the Dharma, abide by the Dharma, possess a wealth of qualities, and have developed control over their minds experience happiness and remain free from harm; to ensure that my teachings do not vanish; and to perfect the happiness of emancipation. The bodhisattva great beings are thus reveling in the domains of concentration to bless those goals. In the places where these bodhisattva great beings revel in the domains of concentration, sentient beings who are afraid of saṃsāra’s suffering and wish for nirvāṇa will, now and after I pass away in the future, order the construction of stūpas and build buddha shrines, buddha statues, or repositories for the Dharma. Alternatively, in those places they will write down my teachings in books and carry this Dharma body of mine. In those places they will also engage in different forms of worship and offer a variety of precious substances such as gold, silver, beryl, crystals, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-066-015-73,folio:F.95.b}}} red pearls, emeralds, white corals, jewels, pearls, gemstones, conch shells, moonstones, corals, silken clothes, bells, silk brocades, high-quality cotton fabrics, fine cloths from Vārāṇasī, padded cushions, carpets, parasols, banners, flags, Dharma robes, necklaces, bracelets, perfumes, flowers, incense, and music, and they will express intense veneration, respect, devotion, and reverence.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-066-015-74}}}At that moment, the Blessed One joined his palms and his ten fingers together and continued: “I will then accept their offerings. In accordance with their inclinations, all those sentient beings will practice the three vehicles in order to reach the level of nonregression. In some lands, they will arrange temples, dwelling places, walking paths, hermitages, parks, and monastic compounds. Alternatively, they will perform or cause others to perform various acts of worship and veneration toward the followers of the hearers’ Dharma by offering Dharma robes, alms, bedding, seats, medicine, and tools. In those temples, walking paths, and hermitages, they will respectfully listen to the Dharma, engage in exegetical discussions about it, and read the scriptures. In those temples, walking paths, and other such places, they will also offer various types of gifts such as offerings stemming from the fields, households, and monastic compounds as well as male and female servants, elephants, horses, camels, oxen, buffaloes, donkeys, and other types of cattle and a variety of containers. {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-066-015-75,folio:F.96.a}}} They will dedicate various bedding and seat articles for the use of my hearers who abide by the Dharma, so that they may attain mental ornaments, mental tools, an assembly of practices, and the supreme happiness of emancipation. They will, now and in the future, offer various types of gifts to benefit my teachings. I will rejoice in and accept all those meritorious deeds manifested through the generosity of those sentient beings, to ensure that they are certain to experience a great result. All those beings will then avoid falling into error and will certainly abandon the three lower realms. Then, in accordance with their inclinations, they will reach the level of nonregression by practicing the three vehicles. As long as they continue in cyclic existence, those beings will never be separated from the two types of enjoyments—the enjoyment of the Dharma and material enjoyment.
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-066-015-76}}}“Now and in the future, whether in mountains, in jungles, under great trees, in the wilderness, or in the woods, there will be monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners who strive for liberation, abide by the Dharma, speak few words, observe silence, withdraw into meditative seclusion, engage in proper mental activity, and act in wholesome ways. There will also be gods, nāgas, and yakṣas. For the sake of discipline, monks, look at the power of the domain of concentration! Having overpowered the domains of all the māras and nāgas, the thus-gone ones of the past who resided, thrived, and lived well engaged with this buddha realm of Sahā to ensure that the way of the Dharma remains for a long time {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-066-015-77,folio:F.96.b}}} and that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted. Now, a countless and limitless number of bodhisattva great beings have arrived in my buddha realm from other buddha realms of the ten directions as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges in order to ask questions, behold me, pay homage to me, worship me, honor me, and hear about the practices of the bodhisattvas who abide by the Dharma and who are endowed with the eye of space and the four correct knowledges. Since they are close to my heart, those bodhisattva great beings are sitting on this earth in states of concentration in order to ensure that the way of the Dharma remains for a long time and that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted; they are engaging with this buddha realm in order to subjugate the domains of the māras out of affection for those sentient beings who are afraid of cyclic existence and exert themselves in generosity. 
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-066-015-78}}}“Now and in the future, as long as my teaching and the sacred Dharma, or even a reflection of the sacred Dharma, remain, should immoral monks who engage in negative actions make use of things that have been dedicated to monks who abide by the Dharma—even just a single leaf, fruit, or flower coming from any house, monastic compound, or field or, likewise, any male or female servant—such fools will encounter misfortune and trouble. 
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-066-015-79}}}“They will experience four types of harm. What are the four? (1) Great infamy related to them will spread in the ten directions. (2) They will soon be separated from their dear and beloved friends, relatives, kin, preceptors, teachers, and attendants. (3) They will suffer from severe and long-lasting diseases. {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-066-015-80,folio:F.97.a}}} (4) Their Dharma robes and alms bowls will be taken away from them by the five great dangers. What are the five? They are (1) kings, (2) thieves, (3) fire, (4) water, and (5) the hostile confiscation of one’s property. 
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-066-015-81}}}In their next lives, four undesirable consequences will quickly manifest for such beings. What are the four? (1) After their bodies disintegrate, they will be born within the terrible great hells. (2) When, in a rare combination of circumstances and after a long time has passed, they finally pass away and leave the hell realms, they will be born in a dry and barren wilderness as blind animals or pretas without arms and legs, and for many hundreds of thousands of years they will experience the suffering of the intense torments caused by hunger and thirst. (3) When, in a rare combination of circumstances and after a long time has passed, they then pass away and transmigrate, they will be born for many hundreds of thousands of years as blind poisonous snakes that feed on dust. (4) When, in a rare combination of circumstances and after a long time has passed, they finally pass away and are born among humans, they will achieve the human condition within empty buddha realms ripe with the five degenerations. They will be stupid and ugly, their eyes, arms, and legs will be impaired, and they will crave dog food and feed on excrement. They will sleep in filthy swamps and rubbish heaps and spend their lives in the wilderness, in barren lands, and on highways. Then, after they pass away, they will again be born within the hell realms.
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-066-015-82}}}“Why will they experience such severe undesirable consequences? Because those monks who engage in negative actions steal and use for their own personal enjoyment the houses, fields, monastic compounds, male and female servants, and cattle that have been dedicated to those who abide by the Dharma. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-066-015-83,folio:F.97.b}}} By doing so, those monks who engage in negative actions are exerting themselves to eliminate, destroy, interrupt, and weaken the amazing and marvelous Dharma way of all the blessed buddhas who have appeared. Similarly, they put effort into eliminating, destroying, interrupting, and weakening the lineage of the Three Jewels. Why is it so? Because there are many on the side of virtue and because the Dharma way, as well as the lineage of the Three Jewels, blossoms due to the side of virtue. This is the reason why such severe ripening of undesirable circumstances will manifest to them.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-066-015-84}}}At that moment, the elder Gayākāśyapa started to shed tears and said, “Respected Blessed One, it would be permissible to remain unchanged even after achieving a human birth, but that is not the case if one engages in evil behavior for the sake of food and drink after becoming a renunciate!”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-066-015-85}}}The Blessed One replied, “Thus it is, Mahāgayākāśyapa! Just as you have said, it would be better for beings to remain in the hell realms and exhaust their previous actions than for them to misbehave like that. Yet, there are some fools who have obtained a human birth, which is so hard to find, and received the vows, which are also so hard to obtain, pertaining to going forth and becoming fully ordained monks under the well-spoken Dharma and Vinaya. These are amazing and marvelous conditions that lead to the exhaustion of all suffering and bring an end to all defilements, yet those fools will entertain thoughts about nonvirtuous practices that will instead cause them to be disrespected and go without food and drink. {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-066-015-86,folio:F.98.a}}} Due to the strength of their erudition or due to the influence of remaining in households, those monks who engage in negative actions will then steal and misappropriate the resources and possessions—houses, fields, monastic compounds, parks, male and female servants, and cattle—that have otherwise been dedicated to support the side of virtue by faithful members of the kṣatriya class, the brāhmaṇa class, the vaiśya class, and the śūdra class who have all donated this to be used by monks that abide by the Dharma and possess a wealth of qualities. Such will be the evil behavior of those fools.”
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-066-015-87}}}At this point King Bimbisāra asked the Blessed One, “Respected Blessed One, if such undesirable consequences are experienced by ordained monks who steal and use for themselves the resources and possessions that have been dedicated to monks who abide by the Dharma and possess a wealth of qualities, what analogy would illustrate the mass of nonvirtue generated by householders who steal and use for themselves the resources and possessions that have been dedicated to monks who abide by the Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-066-015-88}}}The Blessed One replied, “Tell me, Your Majesty, what is the point of your question?”
“Respected Blessed One, I{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-066-015-90}}} donate resources and possessions to those monks who abide by the Dharma and who possess a wealth of qualities—I do not steal them. However, in the future, there will be members of the kṣatriya class, the brāhmaṇa class, the vaiśya class, and the śūdra class who lack faith and are not afraid of the afterlife. They will steal and use for themselves the resources and possessions that have been dedicated to monks who abide by the Dharma and possess a wealth of qualities. What troubles will they experience?”
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-066-015-91}}}“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-066-015-92,folio:F.98.b}}} “If I were to describe the misfortunes that will be experienced by those oxen-like beings—whether from the kṣatriya class, the brāhmaṇa class, the vaiśya class, or the śūdra class—who steal and use for themselves the resources and possessions that have been dedicated to those who abide by the Dharma and possess a wealth of qualities, they would reject and disbelieve my words whenever they have the opportunity to hear my teachings. Those beings will experience two types of harm stemming from great terrors that cause ruin.”
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-066-015-93}}}King Bimbisāra requested the Blessed One a second time, “Blessed One, please instruct us! Well-Gone One, please instruct us! Respected Blessed One, there will be members of respectable family lineages—from members of the kṣatriya class to śūdras—who are afraid of the afterlife and genuinely uphold and consider the excellent teachings of the Blessed One’s well-spoken Dharma and Vinaya. Blessed One, upon hearing the teachings that stem from the activity of your speech, they will, with utmost strength and diligence, consider and protect the well-spoken teachings of the Victor. They will worship, look after, and protect those who correctly follow these teachings, who abide by the Dharma, and who possess a wealth of qualities. They will not steal from householders or from those who have gone forth. However, respected Blessed One, what troubles will be experienced by those householders who steal and use for themselves the resources and possessions of those who abide by the Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-066-015-94}}}“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, “If I were to describe the misfortunes that will be experienced in the future by those oxen-like beings—{{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-066-015-95,folio:F.99.a}}} from members of the kṣatriya class to śūdras—who steal and use for themselves the resources and possessions that have been dedicated to those who abide by the Dharma and possess a wealth of qualities, they would reject and disbelieve my words whenever they have the opportunity to hear my teachings. Those beings will experience two types of harm stemming from great terrors that cause ruin.”
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-066-015-96}}}King Bimbisāra spoke a third time to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, please instruct us! Well-Gone One, please instruct us! Respected Blessed One, there will be members of respectable family lineages—from members of the kṣatriya class to śūdras—who are afraid of the afterlife and genuinely uphold and consider the excellent teachings of the Blessed One’s Dharma and Vinaya. Having heard the teachings that stem from the activity of the Blessed One’s speech, they will, with utmost strength and diligence, consider the well-spoken teachings of the Victor, and they will worship, look after, and protect those who correctly follow these teachings, abide by the Dharma, and possess a wealth of qualities. They will not steal from householders or from those who have gone forth, and they will not steal the resources and possessions of those who abide by the Dharma.”

Your Majesty, in the future, there will be members of the kṣatriya class, the brāhmaṇa class, the vaiśya class, and the śūdra class who steal and rob the offerings related to the houses, fields, monastic compounds, and parks as well as the male and female servants, the bedding, {{page:{number:17,id:UT22084-066-015-98,folio:F.99.b}}} the seats, the medicine, the tools, and the cattle that have been dedicated to those who abide by the Dharma.

(7) Their limbs will be impaired. (8) They will suffer from insomnia. (9) They will constantly be tormented by craving. (10) They will be poisoned by what they eat and drink. (11) They will quickly be separated from their dear and loved ones. (12) They will continuously fight with others. (13) Their fathers, mothers, siblings, spouses, daughters, and male and female servants will not follow their instructions. (14) All their secret mantras, secret riches, secret retinues, and secret possessions will be revealed. (15) Their possessions will be squandered by the five terrors, such as the hostile confiscation of one’s property. (16) They will quickly be struck by severe diseases.

There, for a lifetime stretching over eons, they will drink molten iron and copper, eat lumps of iron, and experience a variety of intense and unbearable harms while having to use clothes, resources, and belongings made of fire. Once the eons of their lifespans are exhausted, they will pass away and be born on paths within a dry and barren wilderness, with the general fortune of pretas with impaired legs, arms, and eyes. There, scorching winds blowing from the four directions will torture them, and they will experience torment and agony on razor-like grounds. They will undergo those types of suffering for many hundreds of thousands of years. When, in a rare combination of circumstances, they pass away and transmigrate, they will then be born within the great oceans as creatures with oblong shapes and bodies that measure a hundred leagues. Due to their previous actions, the water surrounding them will be red like molten copper for leagues. In those waters, they will experience the harms of the hell realms for many hundreds of thousands of years.

“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, “now and in the future, people will put their trust in you members of the kṣatriya class who abide by the Dharma, so look after them and protect them! You must by all means punish, in accordance with the Dharma, the renunciates or householders who steal the resources, possessions, and valuable belongings that have been dedicated to the monks who abide by the Dharma!”

{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-066-015-106}}}“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, “if a single being were endowed with the entire mass of virtue of all sentient beings, including the hearers and solitary buddhas but not the thus-gone ones, would that sentient being be much more exalted than all the hearers and solitary buddhas, {{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-066-015-107,folio:F.101.a}}} and would they possess much greater merit?”
The king answered, “Respected Blessed One, that is correct! Respected Blessed One, that being would be much more exalted! Among all the living beings, there are not many who possess much greater merit than all the hearers and solitary buddhas.”

King Bimbisāra shed tears and remained silent.
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-066-015-111}}}The Blessed One insisted, “Answer this question, Your Majesty, answer this question!”
Weeping, the great king Bimbisāra answered, “Respected Blessed One, the persons who would cut the limbs, gouge the eyes, and chop the ears, nose, hands, and feet of a single one of those meritorious sentient beings would generate an uncountable, limitless, unfathomable, and incomparable amount of nonvirtuous, evil actions, so there is no need to speak of what would happen if one were to cut the limbs, gouge the eyes, and chop the ears, noses, hands, and feet of all those meritorious sentient beings!”

Just as it is for the members of the kṣatriya class, if those who have been appointed as authorities in villages, cities, towns, and countries remain indifferent and do not act against such thieves, all of them will also generate a much greater mass of nonvirtue.”
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-066-015-115}}}King Bimbisāra then asked, “Respected Blessed One, the king himself is heavily burdened, and the members of the kṣatriya class live with a great amount of carelessness. Nevertheless, respected Blessed One, if the king, while living carelessly, were to protect those persons who abide by the Dharma and stand up against the evil actions of sentient beings who steal the resources and possessions that have been dedicated to them, and if all the authorities—from those of villages to those of countries—also stand up against the evil actions of those who rob the resources and possessions that have been dedicated in that way, {{page:{number:22,id:UT22084-066-015-116,folio:F.102.a}}} what mass of merit will they generate?”

Your Majesty, what do you think? Would those beings generate a lot of merit on that basis?”
“A lot of merit, respected Blessed One! Respected Well-Gone One, the mass of merit generated by those beings would be immeasurable, limitless, and unfathomable!”

{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-066-015-120}}}The king then asked, “Respected Blessed One, if not protecting a single monk who abides by the Dharma generates that amount of nonvirtue, does protecting a single one of them generate that same amount of merit?”
“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, “I have not allowed the practice of having only a single individual, or two, or three, or four; instead, Your Majesty, for the purposes of the saṅgha in the four directions, {{page:{number:23,id:UT22084-066-015-122,folio:F.102.b}}} I have prescribed that in each temple or hermitage there should be at least five monks who abide by the Dharma. I have prescribed that those monks who gather swiftly from the four directions at the sound of the gong should share their resources, possessions, rooms, bedding, seats, food, beverages, medicine, and tools. Even if as many as a hundred thousand monks reside in a single temple or hermitage, I have also prescribed in those places the shared use of all those things—up to and including tools—to those monks who gather swiftly at the sound of the gong. I have prescribed such use to those who are detached, unfettered, and dispassionate, to those who do not sleep but exert themselves during the first and last parts of the night, to those who turn their backs to saṃsāra, to those who focus inwardly on nirvāṇa, to those who do not criticize others, to those who do not praise themselves, to those who are content, to those who engage in ascetic practices, to those who remain in seclusion, to those who engender diligence, to those who are settled in equipoise, and to those who engage in the applications of mindfulness.

Your Majesty, by giving away resources and possessions to those beings present within the saṅgha of monks, people generate limitless merit. Your Majesty, when five or more monks reside in a temple or a hermitage, people will acquire limitless merit in relation to such a saṅgha of monks when, at the sound of the gong, they offer resources to those monks who are disciplined, who observe pure discipline, who are apprehensive of the slightest wrongdoing, who teach and recite the discourses related to emptiness that were taught by the Thus-Gone One, who neither criticize others nor praise themselves, {{page:{number:24,id:UT22084-066-015-124,folio:F.103.a}}} who have abandoned envy and miserliness, who are affectionate toward all sentient beings, and who strive for liberation.

Since even such a saṅgha is said to help and benefit countless humans and liberate all beings from all their suffering, what need is there to mention a saṅgha of monks that consists of ten members or a hundred thousand members? Your Majesty, brāhmaṇas and great householders who are filled with faith will beat the gong in order to serve the saṅgha of monks. Your Majesty, regardless of whether there are few or many monks in that saṅgha who engage in negative actions and pretend to be spiritual practitioners, if there are just five monks in that congregation who abide by the Dharma and observe pure discipline and who are perfectly modest and humble, that saṅgha of monks will possess limitless qualities. That saṅgha is very deserving of generosity and deserves to be worshiped by all gods and humans.

Should they be allowed to use and avail themselves of the sacred Dharma robes, alms, bedding, seats, medicine, and tools?”
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-066-015-128}}}“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, “imagine that one of your senior ministers or important officials, someone appointed by the king, a eunuch, a member of the kṣatriya class, a brāhmaṇa, or a householder were to transgress the laws of the government and commit crimes. Your Majesty, would you allow such a criminal to join your personal retinue during royal celebrations and festivals and enjoy him or herself, thus delighting and frolicking to his or her heart’s content?”
The king replied, “No, Respected Blessed One.”

Those persons will be rejected by the Dharma and Vinaya.”
{{milestone:{label:1.65,id:UT22084-066-015-132}}}King Bimbisāra then asked, “Respected Blessed One, what are the signs of behavior through which one knows that monks with impaired discipline who engage in negative actions are henceforth not worthy of remaining, residing, and living among monks who abide by the Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:1.66,id:UT22084-066-015-133}}}“Your Majesty,” replied the Blessed One, “this is not something that can be known immediately by saying ‘These are the features through which their impaired discipline becomes apparent.’ Nevertheless, Your Majesty, the first of these signs is being disrespectful toward the Buddha as well as the Dharma, the Saṅgha, the preceptors, the teachers, and those who are exalted. It also involves renouncing the noble lineage, not delighting in spiritual contemplations, giving up modesty and humility, associating with householders, engaging in idle gossip, praising oneself, criticizing others, enjoying such behaviors, being caught in the trap of negative actions, following unwholesome paths, being arrogant, being haughty, being petty,{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-066-015-134}}} being conceited, being rude, being a hypocrite, being deceitful, being a cunning spiritual practitioner, being like an indolent monk, talking with the wish to cause disharmony in the saṅgha of monks, delighting in gain, honor, and praise, and enjoying the pleasure of entertainment. However, as long as their impaired discipline has not become apparent, one cannot immediately identify such signs in the monks with impaired discipline who engage in negative actions. {{page:{number:27,id:UT22084-066-015-135,folio:F.104.b}}} It is when such monks who engage in negative actions take possession of offerings related to houses, fields, and monastic compounds, as well as male and female servants, elephants, horses, camels, donkeys, and sheep, that their impaired discipline becomes apparent. Due to this, those evil monks will be banished from the saṅgha of monks; they will not be allowed to remain and live there, since they have violated and lost their status as monks, and they will not be able to regain this status in the future.
{{milestone:{label:1.67,id:UT22084-066-015-136}}}“Your Majesty, it is better to reside in the dwelling places of outcastes than to reside with vile and greedy monks who are filled with aggression, who have no consideration for what is beneficial, who reject the afterlife, who lack compassion, who are like great pits filled with excrement, who follow the path of Māra, who harm gods and humans, who deceive all the sages of the three times, who extinguish the Dharma lamp of the lineage of the Three Jewels, who dry up the ocean of the Dharma, who create dissension among Dharma preachers, who deceive almsgivers and benefactors, who hurt monks that abide by the Dharma, and who disrupt the harmony of the Saṅgha. Through their attitude of greed, such evil monks turn the king away from the path that leads to the higher realms, and they will do the same to members of the kṣatriya class and to brāhmaṇas, vaiśyas, śūdras, men, women, boys, and girls. Instead they establish them on the three paths that lead to the lower realms.

If they do reside together with those evil, haughty monks who have abandoned modesty and humility, the monks who abide by the Dharma should be loving and mindful in accordance with the Dharma. If those evil monks decide to leave those places, it is excellent, but if they do not, the monks who abide by the Dharma should then summon those members of the kṣatriya class, the brāhmaṇa class, the vaiśya class, and the śūdra class who govern over those cities, towns, villages, countries, or mountain areas. If the members of the kṣatriya class or the brāhmaṇas, vaiśyas, or śūdras expel the evil and greedy monks from those places, the monks who abide by the Dharma should remain there. If it is the case that, for the sake of food, beverages, or gains, the members of the kṣatriya, brāhmaṇa, vaiśya, or śūdra classes should take the side of the evil and greedy monks, the monks who abide by the Dharma should not show any aggression, attachment, or pride. Instead, they should leave those places without saying a word and go live elsewhere in the wilderness, in forests, in hills, or on mountain slopes, where they should remain silent, withdraw into meditative seclusion, and practice correct mental activity.”

It will be hard for them to achieve a human life again; for those beings who circle in saṃsāra this is the last time to achieve a human life! Even though countless and innumerable blessed buddhas endowed with great compassion—as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges—will appear in the world, those sentient beings who do not listen respectfully to the words of the monks who abide by the Dharma will not be liberated from the lower realms or established in the higher realms.

They will build hermitages for them. In those temples and hermitages, they will also give offerings of houses and fields, male and female servants, and monastic compounds for their use and enjoyment. After they die, they will be born as members of the kṣatriya class who are like great sal trees, or in other states up to the gods of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception.

While you partake in a variety of joys and pleasures during the celebrations and festivals that you, great king, offer, would that person be able to remain in front of you and feel happy and playful and experience different types of joy and pleasure?”
“No, respected Blessed One,” replied the king, “that person would dare not come in front of me, so there is no need to speak of him feeling happy and playful!”

That person harms all the perfect buddhas of the three times and does not deserve to reside, in accordance with the Dharma, in those places that have been dedicated to those who abide by the Dharma. All the members of the kṣatriya class, the brāhmaṇa class, the vaiśya class, and the śūdra class who benefit those evil and greedy monks and do not make them leave those places also cause great harm to all the blessed buddhas of the three times. Though they may have performed many acts of generosity, after they die they will be born within the great Hell of Unceasing Torment. Therefore, Your Majesty, since they only consider their own benefit, one should not side with those evil and greedy monks. Why? Because they harm all the gods and humans; {{page:{number:31,id:UT22084-066-015-146,folio:F.106.b}}} they do not benefit them, they cause them to fall into error, and they destroy the lineage of the Three Jewels.

Chapter Two
{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-066-015-152}}}When the Blessed One had begun this discourse with King Bimbisāra on how to protect all those monks who abide by the Dharma, in the eastern direction, beyond countless buddha realms as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, there was a world called Absence of Torment, where the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Campaka Color was residing, thriving, living well, and teaching the Dharma. In that buddha realm, the bodhisattva great being named Quintessence of the Sun’s Energy was sitting in the assembly of the blessed thus-gone Campaka Color in order to listen to the Dharma. At one point, as the bodhisattva great being Quintessence of the Sun’s Energy looked upward, he saw in the sky above that innumerable and countless bodhisattva great beings were departing from the east and proceeding toward the west. When he looked toward the west where those bodhisattva great beings were going, he saw a brilliant light. At that moment, he bowed down with his palms joined together in the direction of the Buddha Campaka Color and asked, “Respected Blessed One, I have seen in the sky above that innumerable and countless bodhisattva great beings are departing from the east and proceeding toward the west. I have also seen a brilliant light in the western direction. Why is this so?” {{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-066-015-153,folio:F.107.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-066-015-154}}}The thus-gone Campaka Color replied to the bodhisattva great being Quintessence of the Sun’s Energy, “Noble son, in the western direction, beyond countless buddha realms as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, in a place ripe with the five degenerations, there is a buddha realm called Sahā, where the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Śākyamuni resides, thrives, and lives well. To ensure that the Dharma way and the lineage of the Three Jewels endure for a long time and that those who abide by the Dharma remain without interruption, he delivers to a great assembly Dharma teachings that are the gateways to the ascertainment of the three vehicles. He has gathered an assembly in that buddha realm of Sahā in order to destroy the domain of the māras, to cause them to lose their power, to raise the banner of the Dharma, and to ensure that the Dharma way endures for a long time. There, all the thus-gone ones have uttered the dhāraṇī mantra called jewel crest and then left after having engaged with that buddha realm. The thus-gone Śākyamuni has gathered a great assembly of bodhisattva great beings and great hearers. They possess the three eyes that are endowed with the four correct knowledges, and they display the sublime states. This retinue distinctly fills the earth and the sky of the buddha realm of Sahā, and it is insatiable with respect to the sacred Dharma teachings revealed by the thus-gone Śākyamuni. 
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-066-015-155}}}“At one point, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, who is endowed with the most delightful voice, wished to explain the four means of attracting disciples, the practice of the Dharma of The Quintessence of the Sun, the section on the light rays that destroy the nāgas, the dhāraṇī mantra that exhausts the karmic actions of sentient beings. So he formed the following wish: {{page:{number:34,id:UT22084-066-015-156,folio:F.108.a}}} ‘May all bodhisattva great beings who are practicing the six perfections within all the buddha realms of the ten directions—those who have reached emancipation over a hundred eons, who possess the eighteen unique qualities, who are not led astray by others, who have reached the level of nonregression, and who are experts in unobstructed wisdom—come to this buddha realm of Sahā! Once they have assembled here, may they employ their individual virtuous qualities and concentrations so that in this buddha realm this great earth may become highly favorable and nourishing and so that beings may be endowed with qualities, recall, diligence, and generosity—just as in other buddha realms!’

They are miserly yet proudly consider themselves generous. They are unfaithful yet proudly consider themselves faithful. They are hypocritical and deceitful yet proudly consider themselves honest. They are envious yet proudly consider themselves free from envy. They are malicious yet proudly consider themselves loving. They create divisions yet proudly consider themselves harmonious. They have wrong views yet proudly consider their views to be correct.

It exhausts the views related to the transitory collection, all the extremist views, all doubts, all the views that consider discipline and disciplined conduct to be supreme, and all the views of permanence and nihilism, as well as all the views related to sentient beings, obscurations, living beings, persons, creators, feeling subjects, forms, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, great marvels, birth, and abiding.

They will rejoice in their past familiarity with the faculties of faith up to insight, as well as in their former formation of aspirations, meditation on the defects of saṃsāra, and cultivation of the sublime states. Just by hearing it, their lifespans will increase, their health will improve, their resources and possessions will multiply, and their virtuous deeds will immensely increase, as will their accomplishments of roots of virtue, their insight, their love, their equanimity, and their wholesome actions. Just by hearing it, they will all develop the correct view. Those beings who listen respectfully to this great teaching of the fundamental knowledge mantra and contemplate these qualities one-pointedly for seven days without doing anything else will follow the paths of the ten virtuous actions. They will engage in the three types of positive acts, take refuge in the Three Jewels, delight in the strength of aspirations, abide by the Dharma, and illuminate the lineage of the Three Jewels. All those beings—except for those who have committed the acts of immediate retribution or the root downfalls—will recollect their previous lives there. After they die, they will then be born in this buddha realm of Sahā, over and over again.

They should build statues of the seven perfect buddhas and create monastic compounds for the saṅgha of the thus-gone Śākyamuni’s hearers who abide by the Dharma. They should also arrange benefactors in that place, exert themselves in restoring their vows at the proper times, and listen to the Dharma. For those sentient beings who have developed delight and supreme joy in the Three Jewels, there may manifest some undesirable consequences that resemble those various types of intense suffering they would otherwise experience in the three lower realms for myriads of eons: some may be sick for extended periods, but this will lead to the exhaustion of the capacity of their previous nonvirtuous actions. For some, it will be exhausted through their limbs being cut off. For some, it will be exhausted through running out of wealth. For some, it will be exhausted through the dissolution of their retinues. For some, it will be exhausted through losing their resources and possessions. For some, it will be exhausted through being harmed physically by members of their retinues and servants, or through being thrown into prison. For some, it will be exhausted through being told unpleasant words and being insulted. Through such consequences of similar nature, the nonvirtuous actions they created previously will be exhausted.

May I postpone my awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood in order to help those mothers who experience great joy with their children, those who are weary of the burden of having children, and those pregnant women who pay homage to me, as well as anyone who proclaims my name with joy, respect, and faith. May I postpone my awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood in order to help should any human or nonhuman being filled with hostility use medicines or mantras to hurt or disturb the bodies and minds of such mothers and the children they carry in their wombs, or should they for a single instant hurt a newborn baby!’ Those are the aspirations I made in the past when I was a bodhisattva. In accordance with those, anyone who is now tormented by such sufferings in any buddha realm and—as it was explained before—anyone who proclaims my name with joy, respect, and faith will be liberated from their sufferings. It will not be any other way—except when it comes to causes that are results of their previous actions, if these are not purified.”

They lack affection and gratitude, they speak with harsh words, and they adhere to wrong views. So it would not be good if I were hurt there by some of those beings. I would not benefit anyone by going there!”
{{milestone:{label:2.92,id:UT22084-066-015-319}}}“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “it is impossible. There is no chance for this to happen!

Noble son, I will confer upon you a dhāraṇī mantra of great love that emerges from the sublime states free from concepts.

Then, he also confers this powerful and beneficial dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the absence of wishes. It exhausts all forms of attachment associated with the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm. It exhausts pride, special pride, and pride that thinks ‘I am,’ [. . .] it overcomes all the dense darkness of ignorance, and it removes the burden of suffering.

It completely pacifies all sicknesses, quarrels, fights, famines, epidemics, diseases, hostile armies, untimely winds, rains, rivers, cold, heat, snow, and heat waves, and it softens substances that are harsh, rough, and hard to touch. It causes the way of the Dharma to blaze, it reveals the teachings of the buddhas, and it ensures that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted.

It is therefore very profound, valuable, and beneficial. It perfects the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening, it fulfills all wishes, and it causes one to attain the great compassion that ripens sentient beings. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, remember this dhāraṇī mantra that pacifies and puts to sleep hostile beings, and teach it extensively to sentient beings at the proper times. By the mere fact of hearing it, those beings who listen to it will gain many qualities and benefits.

The Thus-Gone One has said that craving—the companion of beings—will cause one to continuously circle and take rebirth in saṃsāra for a long time.”
{{milestone:{label:4.8,id:UT22084-066-015-426}}}The Blessed One replied, “Kauṇḍinya, you act for the benefit and welfare of many beings. This opportune question is excellent! Therefore, Kauṇḍinya, listen carefully and pay attention. I will now explain this.”

{{milestone:{label:4.9,id:UT22084-066-015-429}}}The Blessed One then said, “Kauṇḍinya, the term craving refers to three types of craving. What are the three? They are (1) the craving related to the desire realm, (2) the craving related to the form realm, and (3) the craving related to the formless realm. 
{{milestone:{label:4.10,id:UT22084-066-015-430}}}“There are also three other types of craving: (1) the craving related to arising, (2) the craving related to disintegration, and (3) the craving related to phenomena. 
{{milestone:{label:4.11,id:UT22084-066-015-431}}}“Kauṇḍinya, what are the forms of craving related to the desire realm? Desire refers to sexual intercourse. Careless beings strive to experience sensual pleasures, and humans with base natures delight in them. All forms of attachment will develop in sentient beings who are tormented by lustful longing. Those beings will therefore adopt the paths of the ten nonvirtuous actions and abide by it. Through such causes and conditions, the hell realms, the animal realms, the World of the Lord of Death, and the abodes of the destitute yakṣas will manifest. Due to attachment, sentient beings will experience a variety of harsh and unbearable sufferings within the five destinies of saṃsāra, and yet they will not be afraid of attachment. Since they have abandoned humility and modesty, and since they are disconnected from roots of virtue, they will only very rarely obtain a human body. Due to attachment, they will repeatedly engage in various physical, verbal, and mental unwholesome actions—up to the acts with immediate retribution. They will, repeatedly and for long periods of time, experience harsh and unbearable feelings in the lower realms. Since these are all caused by and based on attachment, they are referred to as the downfalls stemming from the latent propensities of attachment. {{page:{number:114,id:UT22084-066-015-432,folio:F.148.a}}}

He causes them to understand that desires are repulsive like kimpaka fruits, heaps of glowing embers, vases filled with poison, stinking excrement, the edges of razor blades, thieves, the houses of outcastes, blazing iron lumps, hailstones, poisonous snakes, enemies, desolate roads, islands of rākṣasīs, executioners, rubbish, or charnel grounds. He causes them to understand the defects associated with attachment to sensual pleasures, clinging to desirable objects, lustful longing, the origination of desire, and the desires themselves. Knowing the defects of desires, those beings will grow weary of them. They will cultivate attitudes that agree with the Dharma, joyfully abide by the trainings they uphold, pursue the Dharma, delight in the joy of the Dharma, accumulate a wealth of Dharma, develop pure mindsets that are in accord with the Dharma, genuinely follow the path of the Dharma, and devote themselves to it. When they die, they will remember the Dharma, and the flavor of the Dharma will ripen in them. In whatever directions those beings who have lived with minds moistened by the Dharma look, they will see blessed buddhas who reside while teaching the Dharma in the company of great assemblies. They will hear the Dharma, and upon hearing it {{page:{number:115,id:UT22084-066-015-435,folio:F.148.b}}} they will behold the thus-gone ones with very delighted minds.

There, they will enjoy a wealth of qualities, self-control, and restraint. They will join the company of those who revel in the concentrations and the higher perceptions, those who are adorned with the perfect happiness of emancipation, with great love, and with great compassion, those who ripen all sentient beings, and those who are ornamented with the qualities of the buddhas.{{note:{index44,id:UT22084-066-015-437}}} By coming into contact with them, the latent imprints of their afflictions that lead to rebirth will be exhausted, and they will be adorned with those same qualities. It will be as when various fragrant substances are placed in a basket together with some ornaments. Before long, those ornaments will be permeated by those fragrances and will begin to emit the same scents. Even though their colors are dissimilar, they will soon be suffused with those fragrant substances. Similarly, Kauṇḍinya, at the time of death, sentient beings who know the defects of desires will behold the buddhas. After they die, they will leave behind the lower realms and be born within buddha realms in which a buddha is present. [. . .] There, they will be adorned with those same qualities, and before long they will awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.

They should also question them about the experience of desires, their defects, and the emancipation from them. Upon hearing the Dharma in those places, they will swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.

We shall listen to this teaching one-pointedly and accomplish it in accordance with our strengths!”
{{milestone:{label:4.16,id:UT22084-066-015-442}}}The Blessed One then said, “The desires of sentient beings arise through four conditions. What are the four? They are (1) the attachment to form, {{page:{number:117,id:UT22084-066-015-443,folio:F.149.b}}} (2) the attachment to shape, (3) the attachment to contact, and (4) the attachment to passionate frolicking. 
{{milestone:{label:4.17,id:UT22084-066-015-444}}}“What is meant by ‘attachment to form’? The wise ones, at the appropriate times, investigate the four great elements in terms of their exhaustion, selflessness, and the absence of sentient beings. On the other hand, immature beings who rely on mistaken views apprehend the objects they investigate with concepts such as ‘this is the body of a woman,’ ‘this is the body of a man,’ ‘this is bad,’ ‘this is good,’ ‘this is pleasant,’ or ‘this is undesirable.’ When men who are intoxicated by desire see the appearance of women, they fixate on attributes and signs. They thereby generate the ground of desire, the inclination toward desire, and the strong attachment to desire that had not yet previously arisen, and their roots of virtue will therefore become corrupted. Those beings will be rejected by all the wise ones, and since they do not guard their body, speech, and mind, they will involve themselves in all sorts of unwholesome activities. They will not care about the emancipation from desires, and they will fall into the three lower realms. After they die, they will be born as hell beings, animals, or pretas. Through the causes, the conditions, and the ground of such desires, they will experience harsh, scorching, and unbearable feelings of suffering in those places for a long time. 
{{milestone:{label:4.18,id:UT22084-066-015-445}}}“While they know them to be women and men, the wise ones generate the perception of repulsiveness: they imagine their absence of hair, their skin, their ligaments, their flesh, their absence of blood, their bones, and their white human skulls. They pursue that process, cultivate it, {{page:{number:118,id:UT22084-066-015-446,folio:F.150.a}}} and repeat it. They apply the same process with respect to the physical forms of men as they do with respect to the physical forms of women. They apply the same process with respect to what is far away as they do with respect to what is present in front of them. They apply the same process with respect to what is present in front of them as they do with respect to what is far away. Just as they do with others, they focus their attention and apply knowledge to their own white heaps of bones, their absence of hair, their skin, their ligaments, their flesh, and their lack of blood. By repeating that process many times, their minds become fully settled, trained, and focused. This is the first authentic elimination of the sphere of mental afflictions. 
{{milestone:{label:4.19,id:UT22084-066-015-447}}}“Then, directing their attention on those heaps of bones, they apply their mindfulness to a spot about the size of a jujube fruit between their eyebrows.

How is it that their minds are utterly purified? Because they are pacified in all possible respects. Contemplating, cognizing, and observing this for a while is the second Dharma gateway, which accords with the practice of tranquility, eliminates attachment, and eliminates the sphere of afflictions.

Because, in a similar way, the inhalation and exhalation of their breath is interrupted in their meditation—they neither breathe in nor breathe out. With both their bodies and minds utterly purified, they exert themselves in tranquility and focus on cessation. This is the third Dharma gateway, which focuses on cessation and eliminates the sphere of afflictions. 
{{milestone:{label:4.21,id:UT22084-066-015-449}}}“Furthermore, the minds of those who are agitated can quickly become in accord with the practice of tranquility. For this, they should direct their attention to a spot about the size of a jujube fruit on the soft area at the top of their heads. {{page:{number:119,id:UT22084-066-015-450,folio:F.150.b}}} They should then cultivate this and repeat the process many times. Next, they should visualize and cultivate this up to the fontanel and repeat the process many times. After that, they must visualize their bones on that spot being pulverized into dust about the size of sand grains. After the second and third stages, they continue up to the point at which they visualize their entire skull and all their bones being pulverized into dust. They will then visualize that dust being blown away by the wind, until nothing but empty space remains. In this way, both their bodies and minds become utterly purified. This is the fourth Dharma gateway, which strives in the practice of tranquility, focuses on cessation, and eliminates the sphere of afflictions.”
{{milestone:{label:4.22,id:UT22084-066-015-451}}}Venerable Kauṇḍinya then asked, “Respected Blessed One, does the complete wisdom of the realm of the conditioned include the limit of reality of the realm of space, the ground of voidness?”
“Yes, noble son. The limit of reality of the realm of the conditioned is like space; it pervades everything one sees.”
{{milestone:{label:4.23,id:UT22084-066-015-453}}}Ājñātakauṇḍinya then said, “Respected Blessed One, is space one’s own cognition, or does it pervade others’ cognition?”
The Blessed One replied, “Since it pervades the realm of all phenomena, the entire realm of the conditioned must also pervade one’s own cognition. Why is it so? Those who meditate on the complete purity of form will behold the thus-gone ones. Those who see the bones of the skull being pulverized into dust and blown away by the wind will destroy all forms, so that no material form will appear anymore to their eye consciousness. They focus their attention and meditate on empty space, {{page:{number:120,id:UT22084-066-015-455,folio:F.151.a}}} and they do so repeatedly. In all the directions and in between, they will perceive space that is pure like beryl; the appearance of the thus-gone ones will manifest in their minds, and they will see the appearance of the thus-gone ones within that space. When they look in any of the directions and in between, they will perceive the forms of the thus-gone ones. The thus-gone ones, adorned with the excellent marks, will appear to their eye consciousness. In whatever direction or intermediate direction they gaze, they will only see the bodies of buddhas fully adorned with the thirty-two major marks, surrounded by auras of light, and with circumferences like that of a banyan tree.
{{milestone:{label:4.24,id:UT22084-066-015-456}}}“If, in accordance with their class, they have accumulated roots of virtue that accord with the aspect of certainty, they will wonder, ‘I must definitely ask the Thus-Gone One about who created space and where it will be exhausted!’ They will then think, ‘I have already asked the Thus-Gone One this.’ The Thus-Gone One will tell them, ‘Space is a verbal concept, and that concept is nonexistent. The term space and all other concepts are insubstantial. All phenomena are utterly nonexistent, unchanging, and devoid of characteristics. By investigating them from the perspective of the absence of characteristics, one becomes completely free from the basis of those characteristics.’ Upon hearing that teaching, they will then swiftly attain the fruition of nonreturners, and all their desires and attachments related to the form realm will disappear without remainder. Likewise, all their attachments related to the formless realm, their ignorance, their pride, and their agitation will also disappear without remainder.
{{milestone:{label:4.25,id:UT22084-066-015-457}}}“If those who, in accordance with their class, lack the roots of virtue that accord with the aspect of certainty {{page:{number:121,id:UT22084-066-015-458,folio:F.151.b}}} see the body of the Buddha, they will think, ‘I am truly apprehending the size of the Thus-Gone One.’ When they look in all directions, they will see the Thus-Gone One everywhere throughout all of space. If they view the Thus-Gone One as being small, they will perceive him as being small. If they view him as being immeasurable, they will perceive him as being immeasurable. However, they will then think, ‘Where does the Thus-Gone One come from? The Thus-Gone One does not come from anywhere and does not go anywhere. No place can be found where the Thus-Gone One goes to or comes from! Since the body and the three realms are caused by the mind alone, beings perceive in accordance with their concepts. I create the Buddha with my own mind. I see the Buddha through my mind. My mind itself is the Buddha, my mind itself is the body, and my mind itself is space. I perceive the Buddha through the concepts of my own mind. The mind does not cognize the mind. The mind does not see the mind. Mental perceptions are devoid of cognition. Mental perceptions are negations, and negations are insubstantial. Those phenomena only manifest because they are devoid of cognition.’
{{milestone:{label:4.26,id:UT22084-066-015-459}}}“Those who have previously given rise to the mind set on awakening and realized emptiness through insight will then contemplate objects while contemplating their intrinsic emptiness. They will attain the absorption in which the present buddhas are dwelling. Even so, they are followers of the hearers’ vehicle. Since they have become accustomed to all forms being devoid of marks, their insight, their freedom from attachment, and their ignorance are purified. By contemplating emptiness, {{page:{number:122,id:UT22084-066-015-460,folio:F.152.a}}} they will attain the keen acceptance that accords with emptiness, and later on they will achieve its fruition without difficulty. If they meditate on empty space, their bodies and minds will be utterly purified. They will reach the gateway of liberation of emptiness, and they will achieve that fruition without difficulty. This the fifth Dharma gateway, which strives in emptiness, focuses on cessation, and interrupts the waves of afflictions.” 
{{milestone:{label:4.27,id:UT22084-066-015-461}}}As this teaching was being given by the Blessed One, ninety-nine trillion gods and humans from that retinue achieved the concordant acceptance, and eighty-four thousand of them achieved the acceptance that accords with emptiness. Similarly, sixty thousand beings reached the gateway of liberation of the absorption of emptiness, and twenty thousand of them achieved the absorption in which the present buddhas are dwelling. Countless sentient beings also achieved the fruition of the stream enterers, and the minds of eighty-four thousand monks were liberated from their defilements with no further grasping. 
{{milestone:{label:4.28,id:UT22084-066-015-462}}}The Blessed One then said, “Furthermore, Kauṇḍinya, those who do not dwell mentally on that contemplation of the skull, who have no faith in it, and who are not inspired by it should go to a charnel ground. There they will see a variety of human corpses—some bluish, some festering, some bloody, some being devoured, some decomposed, some without flesh and blood, and some as bare bones completely white like conch shells. They should examine all these corpses repeatedly. If they contemplate those objects, keep them in mind, and meditate on them with quiet minds, without wavering or being distracted, {{page:{number:123,id:UT22084-066-015-463,folio:F.152.b}}} they will experience everything up to the exhaustion of all their defilements.
{{milestone:{label:4.29,id:UT22084-066-015-464}}}“Sentient beings with overweening pride should contemplate, visualize, and meditate on human corpses that become bluish shortly after death. They will then perceive their own bodies in the same way they perceive the corpses they have contemplated. They will see that their own bodies are the same as the corpses of others—they are not different from bluish and festering corpses. By maintaining their efforts in applying this meditation to their own bodies, they will perceive their bodies entirely festering and bloody, their bellies infested by maggots. They will see their bodies entirely infested and devoured by maggots, up until the stages where they are without flesh and blood and become bare bones completely white like conch shells, heaps of bones connected with ligaments. This is what they should focus on, build up, and cultivate. Day and night, whether they are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, they should contemplate, visualize, and meditate on their own bodies as heaps of bones completely white like conch shells and connected with ligaments and skin. They will be able to perceive this in the blink of an eye. {{page:{number:124,id:UT22084-066-015-465,folio:F.153.a}}} Just as they perceive their own bodies, wherever they look—whether at the earth, trees, humans, or animals—they will see heaps of bones completely white like conch shells and connected with ligaments. Wherever they walk{{note:{index46,id:UT22084-066-015-466}}} and travel, they will tread on and sidestep heaps of bones. They will trample on heaps of bones, sit on them, and sleep on them, just like those who have cultivated, focused on, and exerted themselves in the perception of repulsiveness. They will abandon all forms of attachment related to the desire realm, in accordance with their class but not otherwise.
{{milestone:{label:4.30,id:UT22084-066-015-467}}}“This is the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness. It gathers the winds from the four directions that pulverize the heaps of bones into dust and disintegrate them. Just as it gathers the winds that pulverize the heaps of bones of their own bodies into dust and disintegrate them, it also gathers the winds that pulverize all bodies and this entire earth into dust and disintegrate them to the point that material form will no longer appear before theirs or others’ eyes. 
{{milestone:{label:4.31,id:UT22084-066-015-468}}}“Those beings will then focus on the empty, beryl-like space. They will visualize space, meditate on it, and repeat that process many times. They will think, ‘Furthermore, for the sake of investigation, I will contemplate the sky as being yellow. I will envisage the sky to be yellow, visualize that, and meditate on it.’ In that way, they will imagine that the entire sky is yellow. In the same way, they will imagine that its color is red, white, crimson, and every other color up to crystalline. Similarly, they will visualize all material appearances and the entire earth as blue water, {{page:{number:125,id:UT22084-066-015-469,folio:F.153.b}}} thereby imagining these to be blue. They will also contemplate, cognize, and envisage the entire earth as being water with colors ranging from yellow to red, white, violet, and crystalline. They will then visualize the entire earth element as crystalline, and after that, they will visualize that it is reduced to the size of about four fingers. Then, they will hit it with their toes and make it shake, rock, quiver, and quake as they please—they will shake it in any way they want. When they shake it, this great earth with its mountains will quiver, wobble, shake, and quake.
{{milestone:{label:4.32,id:UT22084-066-015-470}}}“They will also contemplate, cognize, envisage, and visualize blue, pink, red, and white lotus flowers on that water, and they will clearly imagine fresh breezes blowing in the four directions. They will then walk, sit, and lie down on these flowers. They will also visualize, in the four directions, great mountains of various colors, on top of which they will walk, rest, sit, and lie down. Then, interrupting that process, they will contemplate, consider, cognize, envisage, and visualize these mountains to be pure space. Next they will contemplate, envisage, and visualize their bodies to be light—just like a piece of cotton wool that is fluttering in the breeze and carried off by a gentle wind. {{page:{number:126,id:UT22084-066-015-471,folio:F.154.a}}} They will contemplate and visualize the lightness of their bodies to the point at which as they are carried by the wind they dwell in midair, where they will then walk, sit, rest, and lie down. Next they will rest in absorption on the fire element and radiate various blue, yellow, red, violet, and crystalline lights from their bodies. They will emit blazing fire from the upper parts of their bodies and shower down streams of cold water from their lower parts. At other times they will emit blazing fire from the lower parts of their bodies and shower down rains of cold water from the upper parts of their bodies.
{{milestone:{label:4.33,id:UT22084-066-015-472}}}“Likewise, they will manifest themselves on top of the earth, caress the sun and the moon with their hands, and physically exert their influence up to the world of Brahmā. Interrupting that process, they will then contemplate and visualize forms in any number and color they might think of, such as blue, yellow, red, white, violet, or crystalline. If they think, ‘I am looking at the Thus-Gone One,’ they will see the Thus-Gone One. Wherever they look, they will see the Thus-Gone One. If they think that the Thus-Gone One’s body is small, they will perceive him as being small. If they think that it is immeasurable, [. . .] they will see the Thus-Gone One as filling the entire sky. They will think, ‘The Thus-Gone One does not come from and does not go anywhere. {{page:{number:127,id:UT22084-066-015-473,folio:F.154.b}}} The cause of the bodies present in all the three realms is only the mind. I perceive things in the way I imagine them. I perceive the various different colors, forms, and magical displays of my own mind. My mind consists of different forms, magical displays, colors, cognitions, and concepts—it manifests in a variety of ways. The mind is mingled with space; it is described as wind, and all winds are insubstantial.’ Such is the meaning of the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth shared by ordinary beings, the dhāraṇī mantra that the thus-gone Campaka Color conferred upon me through the bodhisattva great being Quintessence of the Sun’s Energy. 
{{milestone:{label:4.34,id:UT22084-066-015-474}}}“What is the meaning of the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth unshared by ordinary beings? It is the abandonment of the attachment to form and shape. Some will think, ‘Space is inapprehensible and inexpressible. In the same way, the mind is also inexpressible—both are inexpressible. These aggregates are accompanied by torment, anxiety, delusion, and deception, so if I now fully abandon the conceptual mind, there is no doubt that space will be abandoned, as will all discursiveness that arises on the basis of concepts!’ However, they should know this by observing space through the first instant of their mind, so that all cognitions are interrupted and none are generated. Mental productions will then cease, and those that have not yet arisen will not be produced. In that way, since its causes have ceased, the mind will also cease, {{page:{number:128,id:UT22084-066-015-475,folio:F.155.a}}} and they will enter the absorption of cessation in which physical, verbal, and mental formations are utterly purified. They will spend either one day within that cessation, or, if they prefer, many hundreds of thousands of eons will pass before the first instant of mind arises, immediately after the absorption of cessation. Within the second instant of mind, all their defilements and lives will be exhausted, and they will simultaneously pass into parinirvāṇa. This is the meaning of the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the undefiled truth unshared by ordinary beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.35,id:UT22084-066-015-476}}}“What is the meaning of the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth both shared and unshared by ordinary beings? Some will think, ‘Forms are only perceived in the way they are imagined. The mind is both the mind and forms, so I should not imagine pure space.’ Wishing to abandon all forms, they will abandon all their perceptions of forms, and they will then perfect and dwell within the sphere of infinite space while thinking, ‘This is infinite space!’ This is the absorption that is shared by ordinary beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.36,id:UT22084-066-015-477}}}“Some will then think, ‘My physical form is space—I see space as physical form. What is the defining characteristic of space? The defining characteristic of space is that it accommodates. However, space is pervaded by the winds, and the winds arise from the four great elements. My physical form is also made of the four great elements, since both have the same defining characteristics.’ They will wonder, ‘Does everything that arises have the essence of the great elements?’ {{page:{number:129,id:UT22084-066-015-478,folio:F.155.b}}} They then think, ‘Neither of these arise with general characteristics.’ Why is that? Because all phenomena are intrinsically empty. Similarly, one’s own essence is also empty of any other entity—it is unborn, unceasing, unarisen, and groundless.’ When they investigate in that way, the thus-gone ones will manifest in their minds, and those beings will see nothing but the thus-gone ones throughout all of space. Perceiving the thus-gone ones in that way, they will attain the fruition of the non-returners. This is the first sphere of liberation based on the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth shared by ordinary beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.37,id:UT22084-066-015-479}}}“Again, some will wonder, ‘Is abiding by this sphere of infinite space the defining characteristic of my own essence, or is it space?’ They will then think, ‘The pure defining characteristic of space is my own identity, but it is not the defining characteristic of my own essence.’ Thinking in that way, the more they contemplate limitless, infinite space, the more they will cognize their identity. This is the absorption that is shared by ordinary beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.38,id:UT22084-066-015-480}}}“Some will then wonder, ‘If all of space is my identity, does space have other essences? When I focus my attention on the thus-gone ones, how do they manifest?’ The more they contemplate the thus-gone ones, the more they will perceive them. As soon as they see them, some will settle within the first fruition, and some will actualize the other fruitions up to the level of the worthy ones who have abandoned all afflictions. This is the second sphere of liberation based on the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth shared by ordinary beings.

At that moment, they will enter the absorption of the absence of perception. {{page:{number:132,id:UT22084-066-015-491,folio:F.157.a}}} Those in whom this has occurred in the past have reached the absorption that is shared by ordinary beings. Similarly, they will think, ‘Consciousness is a pain, a boil, and a disease. I must surely focus my attention on nonexistence!’ What kind of nonexistence? All perceptions are devoid of I and mine. Through that identity, both identity and perceptions must be abandoned—that is nirvāṇa. At the occasion of contemplating nirvāṇa, some will settle within the fruition of the stream enterers, and others will settle within the other fruitions up to the level of the worthy ones.

It frees women from their desires, engenders weariness in the scholars, delights spiritual practitioners, and cures all diseases. It pacifies quarrels, fights, famine, disease, unexpected hostile armies, and untimely winds, rains, floods, cold, warmth, snow, and heat waves, and it softens substances that are harsh, tasteless, and hard to touch.

The world with its gods would be confused about it. Apart from the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas themselves, no one can apprehend it directly. The meaning of this dhāraṇī mantra, the sun’s eye, is unfathomable, difficult to perceive, and hard to realize. Similarly, the meanings of the inexhaustible core, the fundamental knowledge mantra, and the dhāraṇī mantra that pacifies and puts to sleep hostile beings are unfathomable, difficult to perceive, and hard to comprehend. Apart from the thus-gone ones themselves, no one can apprehend them directly.”
{{milestone:{label:4.53,id:UT22084-066-015-505}}}Kauṇḍinya then said, “Respected Blessed One, please explain to us the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness that the thus-gone King of the Lord of Mountains conferred through the bodhisattva great being Gandhahastin!”
{{milestone:{label:4.54,id:UT22084-066-015-506}}}The Blessed One replied, “Thus it is, Kauṇḍinya. {{page:{number:137,id:UT22084-066-015-507,folio:F.159.b}}} In the presence of the world with its gods, I will now explain the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness that the thus-gone King of the Lord of Mountains conferred upon me in this place. This dhāraṇī mantra bestows faith in the teachings that I expound within this assembly. If I explain it here, an innumerable and limitless number of sentient beings will benefit, and they will apprehend it directly. Therefore, Kauṇḍinya, listen!” [. . .]
{{milestone:{label:4.55,id:UT22084-066-015-508}}}The Blessed One then said, “Kauṇḍinya, sentient beings who are intoxicated by the arrogance associated with attachment and who do not care about emancipation will circle in saṃsāra for a long time. They will experience endless harsh feelings of suffering in the three lower realms. The great compassion of the bodhisattva great beings arises for their sake. Then, through the great strength of their compassion, through their great diligence, exertion, and discipline, those bodhisattva great beings swiftly pursue unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and they quickly awaken to perfect buddhahood. With insight, ascertainment, and care and in order to liberate those beings from the three lower realms they teach the Dharma that leads to the exhaustion of suffering. Sentient beings who listen to these teachings with the intention of escaping from suffering will attain the first fruition as well as the other fruitions up to the fourth one. Alternatively, those who are eager to take on the frightening sufferings of saṃsāra in the pursuit of unsurpassed wisdom for the sake of all beings will attain unsurpassed wisdom, and they will then teach the Dharma to emancipate beings from their desires—just as I am doing now. 
{{milestone:{label:4.56,id:UT22084-066-015-509}}}“Kauṇḍinya, what is meant by ‘attachment to contact?’ {{page:{number:138,id:UT22084-066-015-510,folio:F.160.a}}} Sentient beings who connect with one another through physical contact experience pleasant feelings that generate suffering. This will cause them to experience suffering acutely. As an analogy, some deadly poisonous snakes kill beings by staring at them. Other snakes will kill beings with merely their breath. Still other snakes kill beings merely by contact. Finally, other snakes will kill beings merely by connecting with them. Likewise, some sentient beings waste and consume all their roots of virtue through a mere visual contact. Some waste and consume all their roots of virtue by touching one another physically. Some waste and consume all their roots of virtue through a mere interaction. Still others give rise to and experience suffering acutely through the mere contact of sexual intercourse.
{{milestone:{label:4.57,id:UT22084-066-015-511}}}“Kauṇḍinya, what is the emancipation from attachment to contact? Kauṇḍinya, in this context, beings should investigate the clear form of the heaps of bones. How should they do so? Upon seeing desirable, attractive, pleasing, and enticing physical forms that generate in them desire and lust, they should cultivate a wish for the happiness of emancipation by seeing that physical forms are made of the four great elements—by their very nature they will perish, disintegrate, and turn into dust. How do they come to see this? They will perceive this exactly as it is by contemplating, cognizing, envisaging, and visualizing the heaps of bones that are hairless and covered with flesh, have fingernails attached, and are devoid of blood, bare, completely white like conch shells, and connected with ligaments. {{page:{number:139,id:UT22084-066-015-512,folio:F.160.b}}} As they pursue, cultivate, and repeat this process many times, they will genuinely perceive these heaps of bones both day and night, and this will generate in them feelings of revulsion toward the entire world. They will think, ‘Since I am subject to the terrors of old age and death, I must definitely smash to pieces this great vessel of old age and death! How will I be able to completely destroy this great vessel of old age and death? I must do so by carefully investigating this heap of bones!’ Thinking in that way, they will investigate this entire heap of bones, and their attention placed on the perception of the white color of all those bones will become their practice of tranquility. 
{{milestone:{label:4.58,id:UT22084-066-015-513}}}“They will further pursue their investigation by observing ‘These are the bones of my skull’ all the way down to ‘These are the bones of my toes.’ They will wonder, ‘In order to destroy this great vessel of old age and death, where should I undertake the practice of insight?’ They will then think, ‘I must destroy my heap of bones—this great vessel of old age and death—by gathering the winds in my mouth and nose!’ With that thought in mind, they will begin by gathering the winds at the tips of their noses. Then, they will pulverize their bones into the finest particles of dust, and with those winds they will blow this dust away. Through that practice, all their heaps of bones will be disintegrated. Just as all their heaps of bones are blown away by the winds without any remainder, so will they discard their own body, which gives rise to the perception of bones, and thus all of it will appear to be empty. This is the first branch of emptiness. 
{{milestone:{label:4.59,id:UT22084-066-015-514}}}“Furthermore, their identities will appear to them as the emptiness of the inner, but they will still perceive outer physical forms. They will think, ‘I must disintegrate all material appearances by gathering the winds!’ {{page:{number:140,id:UT22084-066-015-515,folio:F.161.a}}} By doing so, all outer appearances of form will be disintegrated by those winds. Having entirely abandoned all the inner and outer appearances of form, they will specifically contemplate this. This is the second branch of emptiness.
{{milestone:{label:4.60,id:UT22084-066-015-516}}}“Again, they will think, ‘All the material appearances I have abandoned appear to me as emptiness and not in any other way. However, since my mind that conceives the winds is not entirely liberated, I must abandon that too!’ Since phenomena do not come from or go anywhere, they will give up conceptualizing in terms of going or the absence of going. This is the third branch of emptiness.
{{milestone:{label:4.61,id:UT22084-066-015-517}}}“Again, they will wonder, ‘Is there anything true at all among all conditioned things?’ Thinking in that way, they will directly understand what is true. Knowing that all phenomena that arise are phenomena that cease, they will understand that all three realms are nonexistent and unreal, and their formations will become utterly purified and pacified. This is the fourth branch of emptiness.
{{milestone:{label:4.62,id:UT22084-066-015-518}}}“Some will settle within the first fruition, some will cultivate the concordant acceptance, and some will reach awakening in accordance with the right times and circumstances. Their efforts to entirely settle concepts and analysis will be completely pacified, and they will enter the absorption of cessation. According to their inclinations, they will pass from one day up to countless eons absorbed in that cessation. In the second instant immediately following the first instant of emerging from that, their afflictions will be exhausted. At that moment, their lives will also be exhausted, and they will simultaneously pass into parinirvāṇa. {{page:{number:141,id:UT22084-066-015-519,folio:F.161.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.63,id:UT22084-066-015-520}}}“This is the eighth, the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness. It is a powerful and beneficial dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth that is not shared by ordinary beings. It exhausts all forms of attachment associated with the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm, [. . .] and it removes the burden of suffering. It is the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness that the thus-gone King of the Lord of Mountains conferred upon me through the bodhisattva great being Gandhahastin. It is a dhāraṇī mantra that bestows faith in the teachings that I expound within this assembly.”
{{milestone:{label:4.64,id:UT22084-066-015-521}}}As this teaching was being given, ninety-two trillion sentient beings settled within the first fruition, and the minds of six million of them were liberated from their defilements with no further grasping. Nine hundred ninety trillion sentient beings who had performed their duties in the past achieved the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness, and eighty thousand of them achieved the self-arisen dhāraṇī mantra. Sixty quintillion sentient beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening and would no longer regress on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
The entire retinue exclaimed “Excellent!” and showered a rain of celestial flowers and perfumed substances. 
{{milestone:{label:4.65,id:UT22084-066-015-523}}}Venerable Kauṇḍinya then said to the Blessed One, “Respected Blessed One, please explain to us the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the absence of wishes that the thus-gone Royal Mass of Glorious Wisdom conferred through the bodhisattva great being Glorious Essence of Light, the dhāraṇī mantra that bestows faith in this great teaching of The Great Assembly!” {{page:{number:142,id:UT22084-066-015-524,folio:F.162.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.66,id:UT22084-066-015-525}}}The Blessed One replied, “Kauṇḍinya, thus it is! Kauṇḍinya, thus it is! Kauṇḍinya, I will explain to this retinue the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the absence of wishes. Kauṇḍinya, there are sentient beings within this retinue who have thoroughly purified themselves in the past and are able to understand this teaching. Therefore, Kauṇḍinya, listen!” [. . .]
{{milestone:{label:4.67,id:UT22084-066-015-526}}}The Blessed One then said, “Kauṇḍinya, there are sentient beings here who lack dedication and are entangled in desire. They do not understand or care about emancipation, and so they will circle in saṃsāra for a long time. [. . .]
{{milestone:{label:4.68,id:UT22084-066-015-527}}}“What is emancipation from the attachment to mental concepts, and how does one correctly train in it? They will think, ‘If all types of attachment—the attachments related to the desire realm, the form realm, the formless realm, shape, contact, imagination, and concepts—arise on account of the connection of formations, who has produced those formations? Who is producing them? They are produced by the winds. My physical, verbal, and mental formations, as well as those winds, must therefore be destroyed! The winds enter and leave from my mouth and nose. It is these winds that have produced the formations, so the very same winds must break apart and destroy this body!’ Thinking in that way, they will imagine that the breaths that are drawn in and expelled dry out their flesh and blood and cause them to disappear. The breaths that are exhaled will discard their flesh and blood outside of their bodies, {{page:{number:143,id:UT22084-066-015-528,folio:F.162.b}}} until they see that their entire bodies have become hollow. They will then visualize how the inhalation and exhalation of the breath through all their orifices fully extracts their hairs, fingernails, flesh, and blood and removes them from their body. This will cause the entirety of their flesh and blood to disappear from their body, until they consider, contemplate, cultivate, and visualize the heaps of bare bones that are white like conch shells and connected with ligaments. 
{{milestone:{label:4.69,id:UT22084-066-015-529}}}“While settled in mental equipoise, their previous connections to the state of attachment related to the desire realm will decline and diminish. Similarly, their attachment related to the form realm, the formless realm, shape, contact, imagination, and concepts will also be suppressed and reduced. However, when their minds are no longer settled in equipoise, they will, according to the circumstances they encounter, be repeatedly and temporarily weakened in relation to objects ranging from form to contact. They will then think, ‘In accordance with my class, I must cut off and eliminate attachment and its basis! Just as a tree that has been cut but not uprooted may still continue to grow, so will the latent imprints of craving that have not been eliminated eventually generate various types of suffering.’ They will therefore meditate on this until they perceive their bodies as skeletons, white like conch shells and connected with ligaments. {{page:{number:144,id:UT22084-066-015-530,folio:F.163.a}}} Similarly, when any kind of form—whether sentient or not—appears before their eyes, they will systematically perceive such forms as white skeletons connected with ligaments, without adding or omitting anything. They will not let their minds be distracted from this. This is their practice of tranquility.
{{milestone:{label:4.70,id:UT22084-066-015-531}}}“At that time, they will train by observing, ‘These are the bones of the skull, these are the teeth, and this is the throat,’ all the way down to ‘These are the bones of the toes.’ In that way, they will accomplish mental concentration that is joined with insight. Why is that? Because they accomplish concentration intentionally. When their minds become utterly still and tranquil, this should be their meditation. When their minds become utterly still and tranquil, they should cultivate that while practicing insight alone. When their minds become utterly still and tranquil while practicing insight alone, they should cultivate that by examining and disintegrating the heaps of bones and grinding them into dust. They should then consider how the mental observation of this dust of bones is not uncaused but rather has the characteristic of being exhaustible and perishable. In that way, they will realize the acceptance that accords with insight. 
{{milestone:{label:4.71,id:UT22084-066-015-532}}}“Because they observe the completely white dust of bones in all material appearances and because they understand that the mind is quick and swift, they will also directly understand the acceptance that accords with arising.{{note:{index50,id:UT22084-066-015-533}}} Because they observe the insubstantial nature of the completely white dust of bones, which they perceive without attachment in all forms, and because they understand the lack of self in the mind that is quick and swift, they will directly understand the acceptance that accords with disintegration. {{page:{number:145,id:UT22084-066-015-534,folio:F.163.b}}} Because they observe the lack of expressibility, fondness, apprehension, equipoise, and existence with regard to the completely white dust of bones, which they perceive without attachment in all forms, they will directly understand the acceptance that accords with peaceful tranquility.
{{milestone:{label:4.72,id:UT22084-066-015-535}}}“Since they will achieve acceptance, they will free themselves from and rise above attachment related to the three times. Their thoughts will be peaceful, their basis will be stable, and they will abandon the limits of the three times. They will abandon the limits of the three types of craving,{{note:{index51,id:UT22084-066-015-536}}} turn away from and pacify the three realms of saṃsāra, abandon the three types of defilements, achieve the three gateways of liberation, and eliminate the three types of fetters. At that point they will achieve the fruition of the stream enterers. Furthermore, through their efforts in becoming accustomed to the fact that phenomena are devoid of true characteristics, they will settle within the fruition of the worthy ones. Moreover, those who perceive all material appearances as heaps of bones that are pure, white like conch shells, and connected with ligaments will obtain highly tranquil minds. They will contemplate this while walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. If they contemplate, cultivate, and visualize that, their practice of tranquility will become utterly proficient and refined.
{{milestone:{label:4.73,id:UT22084-066-015-537}}}“At that moment, the practitioners will understand inner and outer selflessness and emptiness. If a perception of blue should arise in them in relation to those heaps of bones that they visualize in all forms, they will perceive the heaps of bones to be blue. If they should contemplate any of the other colors up to crystalline, they will perceive all material appearances as heaps of bones in those respective colors up to crystalline. These thoughts will arise in them: {{page:{number:146,id:UT22084-066-015-538,folio:F.164.a}}} ‘Why do all material appearances appear as white heaps of bones? Why do they appear as other colors up to crystalline?’ They will then think, ‘Since these are all the echoes of my mind, they are empty and fake—they are all mental projections!’ Those who understand in that way are worthy recipients of the generosity of the whole world. Kauṇḍinya, with the exception of the perception of dislike or the perception of disgust toward food, this is the meaning of the acceptance that accords with the absence of wishes. This is what the thus-gone Royal Mass of Glorious Wisdom conferred upon me.”
{{milestone:{label:4.74,id:UT22084-066-015-539}}}The bodhisattva Sumati then asked, “Respected Blessed One, when the hearers who wish to practice tranquility do so in that way, they will practice repulsiveness. What signs will arise in them?”
{{milestone:{label:4.75,id:UT22084-066-015-540}}}The Blessed One replied, “Those who cultivate repulsiveness in order to exhaust their attachments should direct their attention to their foreheads. The following signs will arise in them: Whenever they conceive of the body with an attitude of revulsion, their entire bodies will begin to shake and ache; this is the first sign. Whenever they cultivate this repeatedly, all their body parts will feel as if they are being scraped against a rough surface; this is the second sign. Then, those who practice without distraction will eventually experience exhilaration throughout their entire bodies, as if they were filled with milk; this is a sign that their minds abide one-pointedly within a state of tranquility. Nevertheless, they will also abandon those feelings of pleasure and well-being by practicing the absence of marks. Furthermore, in order to refine their discernment, {{page:{number:147,id:UT22084-066-015-541,folio:F.164.b}}} their mind will be purified of all afflicted states caused by attachment and will be purified of insight afflicted by ignorance. When that occurs, they will become able to discern the different aspects, from suffering to peace, based on those heaps of bones of all bodies. Next, heat will emerge from their entire bodies. This is the perfection of their practice of tranquility. Through the roots of virtue generated by this heat and the experience of constant bliss, their minds will become pure, and they will know that they are like gods. By examining those heaps of bones according to this fourfold sequence, they will eventually see flames on their foreheads. In order to completely transcend ignorance, they will again and again investigate their heaps of bones according to those experiences; they will repeat this fourfold sequence a great number of times. Thereby, they will not encounter the disintegration of their minds or the phenomena that arise from the mind.’
{{milestone:{label:4.76,id:UT22084-066-015-542}}}“They will then float around in that way without dwelling on anything, like a dust mote in the sunlight. As they now see all conditioned things through their eminent perception, they will correctly understand that all conditioned phenomena are selfless [. . .] and subject to cessation; this is their attainment of the root of virtue of the summit. Furthermore, they will also see fires dying and blazing up on their bodies, as well as brilliant lights shining in the ten directions; this is the path of the first concentration. Similarly, they will attain the roots of virtue as well as the great elements of the form realm. Their entire bodies will be pervaded by the great bliss of the form realm. Sunlight will radiate from their hearts, and wherever they look and examine will be filled with light from the sun. They will meditate on those light rays in accordance with the absence of wishes. {{page:{number:148,id:UT22084-066-015-543,folio:F.165.a}}} At that time, their minds will become free from wishes related to the three realms. They will diligently dwell on emptiness in the same manner without apprehending the four truths of the noble ones. Heat will emerge from their entire bodies, a multicolored warm glow will emerge from the tops of their heads, and parasols will shelter them above their heads; this is the root of virtue of the summit. Furthermore, in accordance with nonapprehension they will fully understand the acceptance that accords with the truth. At that time, they will fully understand the four truths of the noble ones.
{{milestone:{label:4.77,id:UT22084-066-015-544}}}“Noble son, this is the hearer’s meditation on repulsiveness. Those who have thoroughly meditated on repulsiveness will attain tranquility, and those signs will manifest. With such signs and faith, they will follow the eightfold path of the noble ones, abandon all afflictions, and reach the level of the worthy ones. Therefore, noble son, you should teach those contemplations to those who follow the vehicle of the hearers within the buddha realm Victorious through Light Rays.”
{{milestone:{label:4.78,id:UT22084-066-015-545}}}As this teaching on repulsiveness was being given, countless beings present in that place achieved the acceptance that accords with the truth, and countless sentient beings saw the truth.

I must definitely abandon such bliss!’ Thinking in that way, they will make the consciousnesses—from the eye consciousness up to the mind consciousness—disappear in accordance with arising and disintegration. This is the third attainment of faultlessness in those with superior minds, through which they will live happily in the present life. It will be achieved without difficulty or hardship.
{{milestone:{label:4.83,id:UT22084-066-015-552}}}“Again, they will think, ‘I must dwell within the realm of phenomena in accordance with the fact that everything is liberated, exhausted, intrinsically pure, devoid of essence, and peaceful! How should I do so? I must abide in accordance with the pacification of thinking.’ Accordingly, the movement of all their thoughts will completely subside, and their minds will abide peacefully. This is the fourth attainment of faultlessness in those with superior minds, through which they will live happily in the present life. It will be achieved without difficulty or hardship.

Since they have different inclinations, the Thus-Gone One teaches the Dharma through Dharma gateways and discourses that are expressed in different words. The Blessed One teaches different types of perceptions to sentient beings with mistaken views. Hence, the meaning of all those perceptions—whether the perceptions of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness or the perceptions of decomposing corpses, festering corpses, bluish corpses, devoured corpses, or scattered corpses—has been taught here.” 
Ājñātakauṇḍinya then said, “Blessed One, please explain to us how one should cultivate the perception of dislike and the perception of disgust toward food!”

By hearing this, sentient beings will generate a variety of roots of virtue. Since beginningless time, beings have rushed through and circled in saṃsāra while obscured by ignorance, bound by craving, and impeded by the downfall of craving. Those beings take pleasure in this world. Why? Because they are bound by food and sexual intercourse. If they do not hear this Dharma way, they will sink into the five destinies of saṃsāra, and they will constantly be afflicted by suffering. Blessed One, you wish for the happiness of all sentient beings, and you have developed great love and compassion for everyone.

{{milestone:{label:4.89,id:UT22084-066-015-562}}}The Blessed One then said, “Kauṇḍinya, what are the worlds for which dislike must be generated? There are two: the world of sentient beings and the world of formations. What is the world of sentient beings? ‘Sentient beings’ refers to those who are born among the five types of beings—hell beings, animals, pretas, gods, and humans. Within the desire realm, there are twenty planes of existence. Within the form realm, there are sixteen. And within the formless realm, there are four. Such is the number of the worlds of sentient beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.90,id:UT22084-066-015-563}}}“What are the twenty planes of existence of the desire realm? There are eight great hells, each surrounded by sixteen hells. What are those eight?

Due to physical, verbal, and mental negative actions, sentient beings have been born and will be born in those places, experiencing harsh, unbearable, and scorching feelings of suffering. All the physical forms their eyes perceive in those places will be repulsive. None will be attractive; they will all be unpleasant. None will be pleasant; they will all be ugly. None will be beautiful; they will all be hideous. None will be pretty. Therefore, on that basis, they will experience harsh, unbearable, and scorching feelings of suffering in those places. All the sounds they hear with their ears, all the scents they smell with their noses, everything they taste with their tongues, everything they touch with their bodies, {{page:{number:153,id:UT22084-066-015-565,folio:F.167.b}}} and all the mental phenomena they become conscious of will be repulsive. None will be attractive; they will all be unpleasant. None will be pleasant; they will all be dislikeable. None will be likeable; they will all be disagreeable. None will be enjoyable. Their bodies will be consumed by fire; they will eat lumps of iron and drink molten iron and copper. On that basis, they will experience harsh, unbearable, and scorching feelings of suffering in those places. Until the physical, verbal, and mental negative actions they committed in the past when they were born here among humans have been exhausted and purified, they will not die and transmigrate from those places. Kauṇḍinya, consider this: what sentient being who wishes for happiness and feels aversion toward suffering would enjoy and wish for those hells? This is the first destiny of those who engage in negative actions, toward which the wise ones should generate the perception of dislike.
{{milestone:{label:4.91,id:UT22084-066-015-566}}}“Kauṇḍinya, how should the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward the condition of the animals? Kauṇḍinya, there are animals who are born with extremely small bodies: some are born with bodies about the size of the fiftieth fraction of the tip of a hair, others with bodies about the size of dust motes in the sunlight, and yet others with bodies about the size of jujube fruits. Still others obtain bodies up to ten thousand leagues long. The lifespan of some of them lasts for a single instant, whereas the life of others stretches over an eon. In those places, animals do not practice the Dharma or engage in virtue. They have abandoned modesty and humility, they are lacking in compassion and sympathy, they are constantly tormented by suffering, they are always afraid, they eat each other, and they follow all the paths of the nonvirtuous actions. {{page:{number:154,id:UT22084-066-015-567,folio:F.168.a}}} Since they are engulfed in the darkness of ignorance, both those among them who proceed toward the lower realms and those who proceed toward the happy destinies will mistake improper behavior for virtuous action. What wise one would enjoy and wish for the condition of those animals, who are constantly tormented by suffering within the darkness of ignorance? This is the second destiny of those who engage in negative actions, toward which the wise ones should generate the perception of dislike.
{{milestone:{label:4.92,id:UT22084-066-015-568}}}“Kauṇḍinya, how should the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward the condition of the pretas? Kauṇḍinya, there are pretas whose bodies are a finger span in size. Some are born with bodies an arm span in size, others with bodies a thousand leagues long. They are naked, and their bodies are rough, black, shriveled, and devoid of flesh and blood. They are constantly tormented by hunger and thirst, they lack food and drink, and they inhale and exhale fire. They are hostile toward one another, they lack compassion, they are always exhausted, and they cannot find any cool clouds to shelter them. They feed on iron, copper, iron lumps, hot pus and blood, burning dirt, burning excrement, boiling urine, burning winds, or burning food made of roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, and trees. Even such food they find only occasionally and only through much hardship and huge efforts. The life of some pretas lasts for a thousand years, while the life of others lasts for a hundred thousand years. They never experience happiness, they are constantly tormented by suffering, and they are engulfed in the darkness of ignorance at all times, {{page:{number:155,id:UT22084-066-015-569,folio:F.168.b}}} so what wise one would enjoy the condition of the pretas?

Within the human world, people are tormented by the sufferings related to old age, sickness, death, encountering what they do not like, being separated from what they like, endeavoring in a variety of ways, anxiety, aggression, envy, miserliness, calumny, harsh words, covetousness, cold, heat, and harming one another. In the human world, people are constantly tormented by the suffering caused by the remembrance of death, the suffering associated with their short lifespans, and the suffering caused by the recollection of their need to leave this world, so what wise one would wish for and enjoy this human world? This is the fourth destiny of those who commit mixed actions, toward which the wise ones should generate the perception of dislike.
{{milestone:{label:4.94,id:UT22084-066-015-571}}}“Kauṇḍinya, how should the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward the world of the gods? Within the six classes of gods in the desire realm, sentient beings are tormented by the suffering related to craving for desirable objects, and they are tormented by the sufferings associated with their valuables, possessions, and enjoyments. They are tormented by the suffering related to the eventual exhaustion of the roots of virtue they have accumulated previously, the suffering related to striving, and the suffering of being separated from what they like. They are tormented by the suffering of death induced by the exhaustion of their merit {{page:{number:156,id:UT22084-066-015-572,folio:F.169.a}}} and by the suffering of falling again and again into the lower realms. This is the fifth perception of dislike, which is related to the gods of the desire realm. Those were the five ways in which the wise ones should generate the perception of dislike toward the entire desire realm.
{{milestone:{label:4.95,id:UT22084-066-015-573}}}“Kauṇḍinya, how should the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward the gods of the form realm? Among the classes of gods, the sixteen types of gods of the form realm cultivate the worldly concentrations, so none of them are free from the sufferings associated with defilement. They are still tormented by many types of suffering, including the suffering of being born with remainder. They do not care about transcendence and escape, and so they are not free from the sufferings of the lower realms. Since they are tormented by such sufferings, what wise one would enjoy and wish for their condition? The wise ones should generate the perception of dislike toward the form realm in this way.

They are tormented by the suffering caused by their pursuit of perfection, and they are tormented by the fact that they do not master the absorptions related to all the levels. They are tormented by the suffering caused by their lack of mastery of the absorptions common to the solitary buddhas, and they are tormented by their lack of mastery of the domain of the thus-gone ones. Those gods, who will eventually pass away in those places, are tormented by such sufferings. {{page:{number:157,id:UT22084-066-015-575,folio:F.169.b}}} The wise ones should therefore generate the perception of dislike toward the form realm.

They are tormented by such sufferings and by the suffering caused by the fact that they do not master the levels of training and no more training. They are tormented by the sufferings of not hearing the Dharma and lacking mastery of the permanent elimination of all forms of craving. They are also tormented by the sufferings related to the circumstances of death and by the suffering of being born with remainder. They are not free from the all the sufferings of the lower realms. Since they are tormented by such sufferings, the wise ones should generate the perception of dislike toward the formless realm.

This refers to the three types of formations—the physical, verbal, and mental formations. What are the physical formations? Inhalation and exhalation are referred to as the physical formations. What are the verbal formations? Concepts and analysis are referred to as the verbal formations. What are the mental formations? {{page:{number:158,id:UT22084-066-015-579,folio:F.170.a}}} Consciousness and thoughts are referred to as the mental formations. Those three types of formations are the characteristics shared by sentient beings. 
{{milestone:{label:4.100,id:UT22084-066-015-580}}}“How should the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward formations? They should examine the characteristics of their inhalation and exhalation in terms of freshness, staleness, coolness, warmth, and repulsiveness. Having also examined the characteristics of the inhalation and exhalation of all bodies as well as their orifices, they will think, ‘These formations are like lightning—they arise out of nowhere and disappear right away.’ Thinking in that way, they will contemplate how formations are exhausted and insubstantial. All concepts arise as one conceives of things as being different, and these perceptions of exhaustion and insubstantiality arise within concepts. All the perceptions of coolness, warmth, repulsiveness, freshness, and staleness related to those phenomena arise from such perceptions and thoughts, and they lead to the perception of total exhaustion and the perception of insubstantiality.{{note:{index54,id:UT22084-066-015-581}}} They lead to the perception that all formations are exhausted and the perception that they disintegrate. They lead to the perception of the freedom from desire and the perception that apprehends cessation. By seeing the past and future limits of all formations, they will develop the perception of total exhaustion up to the perception that focuses on cessation. Those who have thoroughly purified their way of apprehending formations will perceive all formations as being transitory, perishable, unreliable, impermanent, insubstantial, and selfless. {{page:{number:159,id:UT22084-066-015-582,folio:F.170.b}}} Diligent beings who thus correctly understand will develop the perception of dislike toward all formations. Similarly, by focusing on analytical and nonanalytical cessation, they will apprehend the three times, abandon all fetters, completely purify their vision, and sever the continuity of saṃsāra. Having entered into the faultless reality, they will attain the fruition of the stream enterers. Kauṇḍinya, this is how the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward the world of formations in all its aspects. Kauṇḍinya, this is the contemplation that brings about the perception of dislike.

Kauṇḍinya, whenever the wise ones see Dharma robes, touch them, use them as garments, wear them, take them off, or conceal them, they should develop feelings of revulsion by regarding them as human skin smeared with blood that is bleeding, stinking, and covered with maggots and flies. In that way, clever beings will develop the perception that these robes should not be enjoyed. This is how the wise ones generate the perception of dislike toward Dharma robes.
{{milestone:{label:4.102,id:UT22084-066-015-584}}}“Kauṇḍinya, how should the wise ones generate the perception of disgust toward food? When the wise ones eat food, they should develop feelings of revulsion by thinking, ‘This food is made of entrails, it is hairless and skinless flesh smeared with pus and blood and infested by maggots and flies, and this bowl is a stinking human skull!’ If they eat rice gruel, they should perceive it as a human corpse covered by maggots. If they drink water, they should develop feelings of intense revulsion by regarding it as human blood. Similarly, they should perceive flour as the dust of crushed human bones, and milk cream as human skin. {{page:{number:160,id:UT22084-066-015-585,folio:F.171.a}}} They should also perceive all meat broths, soups, vegetable stews, and lentils as human blood and brain, vegetables as human hairs and teeth, meat as human flesh, and the juices of sugar canes, molasses, grapes, and pomegranates as human blood, brain, phlegm, and marrow. Kauṇḍinya, this is how the wise ones should generate the perception of disgust toward food.

They will achieve the three concordant acceptances. What are those three? They are (1) the acceptance that accords with the absence of wishes, (2) the acceptance that accords with emptiness, and (3) the acceptance that accords with the absence of marks. They will be benefitted by achieving those three worldly acceptances; their minds will penetrate the meaning of the view of emptiness as well as the nonexistence of formations that arise and disintegrate. They will see that the aggregates are intrinsically impermanent, painful, empty, and selfless. {{page:{number:161,id:UT22084-066-015-588,folio:F.171.b}}} They will see that all phenomena—from the elements to the sense sources, the truths, and dependent origination—are intrinsically impermanent, painful, empty, and selfless.

It establishes them up to the level that is without remainder. This dhāraṇī mantra that fulfills all goals and accords with the absence of wishes that the thus-gone Royal Mass of Glorious Wisdom conferred upon me through the bodhisattva great being Glorious Essence of Light is very powerful and beneficial—it is a dhāraṇī mantra that bestows faith in the teachings I expound to this great assembly. It exhausts all forms of attachment associated with the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm, as well as pride.

It subdues the enemies, generates faith in the members of the kṣatriya class, induces comprehension in the brāhmaṇas, delights the vaiśyas, and utterly pleases the śūdras. It frees women from their desires, induces weariness in the scholars, and delights the spiritual practitioners. It completely pacifies the entire world as well as all quarrels, fights, famines, diseases, unexpected hostile armies, untimely winds, rains, floods, cold, heat, snow, and heat waves, and it softens all the substances that are harsh, tasteless, and difficult to touch. It causes the way of the Dharma to blaze, ensures that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted, reveals the teachings of the buddhas, and provides relief to those who are afraid of saṃsāra.

Śāriputra, in this place, the wise ones should investigate the self in the following way: since these beings entertain the notion of a self with respect to their bodies, they should examine their bodies properly. How should they do so? Concerning the sense faculties alone, {{page:{number:165,id:UT22084-066-015-601,folio:F.173.b}}} they should investigate their eyes while sitting cross-legged on their various seats with all their faculties restrained. They should think, ‘My right eye is made of the four great elements. It is connected with ligaments and filled with water. Only the winds control its movements. When they enter the eye faculty, the winds cause the eye to roll and move. Those winds that control the eye and produce its manifestations are in turn supported by space. Space is inapprehensible—it is inexpressible and selfless. Just as space is selfless, so too are the winds. Those winds that enter the eye faculty, make it roll, control its movements, control it, and produce its manifestations are also inapprehensible, inexpressible, selfless, and beyond observation.’
{{milestone:{label:4.114,id:UT22084-066-015-602}}}“Likewise, those who investigate the entire eye by correctly considering the earth element present within the eye faculty, which is solid and the mere size of a banyan seed, will not apprehend a self. They will be free from doubts about this. The earth element is selfless—it is found to be inapprehensible and selfless. In the same way, they will investigate the elements from the water element to the fire element. By investigating the eye in that way, they will have absolutely no doubt about the fact that the great elements that constitute the eye are selfless. They will think, ‘A self that results from contact between eye and form is impossible.’ They will then also properly examine the winds and find that they have the essence of space. Having done so, they will not find a self anywhere.
{{milestone:{label:4.115,id:UT22084-066-015-603}}}“They will then think, ‘A dependently arisen consciousness cannot arise in the absence of conditions. {{page:{number:166,id:UT22084-066-015-604,folio:F.174.a}}} Based on the eye faculty and form, only the eye consciousness arises—it arises due to the condition of form. Name and form arise in association with consciousness, and the six sense sources manifest from that. They are followed by contact, the experience of feeling, the strong attachment of craving, appropriation, becoming, birth, and old age and death. Therefore, all these phenomena are dependent upon the eye consciousness. The eye consciousness does not come from the eastern direction, the southern direction, the western direction, or the northern direction. It does not come from above or from below. It ceases in the same instant it arises—it does not last until the next moment. It ceases, yet it does not go anywhere—it is without composition. All those phenomena arise based on conditions and cease when those conditions are incomplete. That which depends on conditions is selfless. Those conditions are also devoid of a creator, someone who experiences, a producer, or an activator—they are selfless. That which is selfless is empty of I and mine. Why is it so? Because such is the nature of the eye. Since it does not remain eternally, and since it is devoid of disintegration, it is devoid of I and mine. All phenomena are devoid of acceptance and rejection. They are not created by the hearers, by the solitary buddhas, or by the thus-gone ones. The eye is intrinsically selfless. That which is selfless is empty, and all phenomena are empty by way of not being apprehended. Similarly, by training until reaching the gateway of liberation of the absence of marks, {{page:{number:167,id:UT22084-066-015-605,folio:F.174.b}}} they will eliminate the foundation of attachment as well as all the afflictions that arise on its basis.

Some will first split one of their hairs into fifty parts and then further break these parts into ten pieces. They will then repeat that process with each of their hairs, reaching the conviction that a self cannot be found within those hairs. They will then apply the same observation to their skin, flesh, blood, phlegm, ligaments, bowels, brains, bones, marrow, and bile. They will also focus their attention, in the way that has been described before, on the upward-moving winds, the downward-moving winds, and the winds that are devoid of acceptance and rejection.

That which is selfless is empty of I and mine. Why is it so? Because it is the nature of the mind. Since it does not remain eternally, and since it is devoid of disintegration, it is devoid of I and mine.’ All phenomena have the nature of arising and disintegrating, and they are devoid of acceptance and rejection. They have not been created by the hearers, by the solitary buddhas, or by the thus-gone ones. The mind is naturally and intrinsically selfless. That which is selfless is empty, and all phenomena are selfless by way of not being apprehended.

{{milestone:{label:4.121,id:UT22084-066-015-615}}}After the beings present throughout this entire buddha realm of Sahā received these teachings on the meaning of those four dhāraṇī mantras—the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the truth, the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with emptiness, the dhāraṇī mantra that accords with the absence of wishes, and the dhāraṇī mantra peaceful core of knowledge—all attachments related to the desire realm, the form realm, shape, contact, longing, and the formless realm of an innumerable and limitless number of them were exhausted, and their defects became clear to them. Some produced the roots of virtue of repulsiveness, while others gave rise to the six spheres, the spheres of mastery, the spheres of totality, the mindfulness of breathing, {{page:{number:172,id:UT22084-066-015-616,folio:F.177.a}}} tranquility, special insight, the first concentration, the other particular concentrations up to the fourth one, the formless attainments, the acceptance that accords with the truth, the level of the family, and the qualities of the eighth level. Some others also produced the roots of virtue that are common to the hearers, the roots of virtue that are common to the solitary buddhas, and the roots of virtue related to omniscient wisdom, as well as the common absorptions, acceptance, and recall. 
{{milestone:{label:4.122,id:UT22084-066-015-617}}}At that time, when ninety-one trillion women listened one-pointedly to this teaching with the understanding that the female condition is flawed, their female genitals disappeared, and instead they developed male genitals. Likewise, the female genitals disappeared on nine hundred ninety million goddesses, eighty-four thousand female nāgas, eighty-six thousand female yakṣas, eighty-four female asuras, seventy thousand female garuḍas, twelve trillion female kinnaras, one thousand female mahoragas, ninety trillion female pretas, and forty-two trillion female piśācas, and they all developed male genitals. Pregnant women were filled with supreme physical and mental happiness. Even within the animal realms, beings gave birth to male and female offspring without experiencing any form of physical harm or mental distress. These babies were born with unimpaired faculties, perfect physical forms, {{page:{number:173,id:UT22084-066-015-618,folio:F.177.b}}} the power of recall, and the ability to remember past lives, and they were all endowed with courage, endurance, and insight. All the diseases that could prevent pregnant women from giving birth were completely pacified, and the children in their wombs obtained that same level of well-being. After attaining such physical and mental well-being, the baby boys and girls were born with perfect ease. Their appearances were perfect, they possessed the supreme power of recall and the ability to remember their past lives, and they were endowed with courage, endurance, and insight.
{{milestone:{label:4.123,id:UT22084-066-015-619}}}Then all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, pretas, piśācas, kumbhāṇḍas, pūtanas, humans, and nonhumans applauded and exclaimed, “Blessed One, this is excellent! Today the Thus-Gone One has turned the wheel of the Dharma that had never been heard before. It purifies the karmic obscurations of mental concepts, it liberates from saṃsāra, it purifies all destinies in existence, and it brings satisfaction through the nectar of emancipation. This is truly amazing! Today, the Thus-Gone One has showered down a Dharma rain that illuminates all buddha realms. He has done so in order to protect all those beings who have reached maturity, to purify all their defilements, to bring about their attainment of the eye of supreme insight, and to ensure that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted. We shall worship the Thus-Gone One to the best of our ability!”
{{milestone:{label:4.124,id:UT22084-066-015-620}}}Besides those who were exerting themselves in absorption, {{page:{number:174,id:UT22084-066-015-621,folio:F.178.a}}} all the gods and the others up to the pūtanas offered divine music and played instruments to worship the Blessed One. They showered down a rain of divine golden powder as well as rains of divine flowers, perfume, incense, fine cloths, Dharma robes, ornaments, and divine flower garlands. To worship the Blessed One, who was like the rising sun, they also tossed precious flowers, perfumes, incense, fine cloths, and garlands.
{{milestone:{label:4.125,id:UT22084-066-015-622}}}This concludes the chapter called “The Purification of Karmic Actions,” the fourth among the eleven chapters in “The Quintessence of the Sun,” the noble Great Vehicle discourse of The Great Assembly.

{{milestone:{label:5.13,id:UT22084-066-015-647}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked, “O Lord of Guhyakas, can space be seen to degenerate?”
“No,” replied Vajrapāṇi, “because space is devoid of dwelling and imputation.”
{{milestone:{label:5.14,id:UT22084-066-015-649}}}Maitreya asked, “Can phenomena be seen to assemble?”
“No,”{{note:{index58,id:UT22084-066-015-651}}} replied Vajrapāṇi, “because they are within the limit of reality.”
{{milestone:{label:5.15,id:UT22084-066-015-652}}}“Can the limit of reality and space be seen as different?” asked Maitreya.
“They are indistinct,” replied Vajrapāṇi, “and therefore not different.”{{note:{index59,id:UT22084-066-015-654}}}
{{milestone:{label:5.16,id:UT22084-066-015-655}}}Maitreya asked, “Are space and phenomena different?”
“Since they are within the unmoving and unborn realm of phenomena, they are devoid of difference,” replied Vajrapāṇi.
{{milestone:{label:5.17,id:UT22084-066-015-657}}}“Noble son,” asked Maitreya, “can the distinction between conditioned and unconditioned phenomena not be seen?”
Vajrapāṇi replied, “Just as the limit of reality and suchness are indistinct, conditioned phenomena are imputations projected onto space, and they are therefore indistinct.”
{{milestone:{label:5.18,id:UT22084-066-015-659}}}“Is it conditioned phenomena that accord with the limit of reality, {{page:{number:183,id:UT22084-066-015-660,folio:F.182.b}}} or is it unconditioned phenomena?” asked Maitreya. 
“Since emptiness is an imputation,” replied Vajrapāṇi, “there are either conditioned or unconditioned phenomena within the limit of reality and suchness.”
{{milestone:{label:5.19,id:UT22084-066-015-662}}}Maitreya asked, “Is there any assembly within emptiness?”
Vajrapāṇi replied, “Since it is not lasting, and since it is intrinsically empty and devoid of disintegration, the assembly of all phenomena is emptiness. Not even an entity named emptiness can be found. Noble son, the essential nature is empty of essential nature, the basis of characteristics is empty of the basis of characteristics, and the nonexistence of the basis of characteristics is also empty of the basis of characteristics. One should understand all phenomena in that same manner. Why? Because all phenomena are inexpressible and are therefore emptiness. The essential nature of all phenomena has not been created by the hearers, by the solitary buddhas, or by the thus-gone ones. One should understand that the limit of reality, suchness, and conditioned and unconditioned phenomena all have the nature of space, and therefore they are all devoid of difference—they are indistinct.”
{{milestone:{label:5.20,id:UT22084-066-015-664}}}As this teaching was being given, the obscurations stemming from nonvirtuous actions committed in the past by countless sentient beings who had previously trained in the mode of emptiness were exhausted, and they attained the eye of Dharma, which is immaculate and spotless with regard to phenomena. Nine billion two hundred thousand sentient beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed awakening and obtained the qualities of nonregression.

This is amazing! Respected Well-Gone One, this is truly amazing! Still, besides this buddha realm and its outer mountain range, nothing else whatsoever appears. Respected Blessed One, if this entire buddha realm of Sahā is perceived due to the light of those bodhisattva great beings, what would the light emitted by the thus-gone ones who have entered into absorption be like? Might we be able to perceive the arrays of qualities of other buddha realms through the light emitted by the Thus-Gone One?”
{{milestone:{label:6.2,id:UT22084-066-015-668}}}The Blessed One replied, “Thus it is, Your Majesty! The thus-gone ones dwell within their own domains. They are adorned by the ornament of great merit. They display boundless accomplishments as their abodes are ripened into buddhahood, which is the outcome of the roots of virtue they created by gathering accumulations in the past and the outcome of their previous bodhisattva activity. The thus-gone ones’ manifestations are blessed by the domain of nonattachment; they possess the intelligence that engages in the generation of bright wisdom, and they are born from the perfection of wisdom. They have reached accomplishment for all future eons, they dwell within the limitless domain of the buddhas, they turn the wheel of the Dharma, and they are the result of having gained control over all phenomena. {{page:{number:185,id:UT22084-066-015-669,folio:F.183.b}}} They know those among all beings who are of highest faculties and those who are not, and they are skilled in ripening beings. Since they have truly conquered habitual patterns, they display the spontaneous accomplishment of their enlightened activities. Your Majesty, these are the reasons why you will perceive an innumerable and limitless number of universes in all the ten directions. In the same way, you will also perceive an innumerable and limitless number of thus-gone ones surrounded by assemblies of bodhisattvas and hearers residing in those places.”
{{milestone:{label:6.3,id:UT22084-066-015-670}}}King Bimbisāra and the tens of millions of other beings then said in unison, “Blessed One, please show us the domain of the buddhas, the outcome of the ornament of great merit! Please show us everything up to the spontaneous accomplishment of your enlightened activities! Blessed One, please agree to show us the domain of the thus-gone ones!”
{{milestone:{label:6.4,id:UT22084-066-015-671}}}The Blessed One said to Venerable Ājñātakauṇḍinya, “Kauṇḍinya, all the great hearers, the householders, and the renunciates should remain absorbed within their own virtuous factors. I will also remain absorbed within my own domain—the domain of the buddhas.”
{{milestone:{label:6.5,id:UT22084-066-015-672}}}At that moment, all the beings—from gods, nāgas, and yakṣas to humans and nonhumans—who had seen the truth, who had achieved the concordant acceptance, who would no longer regress from the three vehicles, and who had sincere faith in the Three Jewels sat cross-legged and entered into absorption. {{page:{number:186,id:UT22084-066-015-673,folio:F.184.a}}} Then, within the domain of all the buddhas, the Blessed One entered the absorption known as the sun and moon–like absorption that pervades the sky with insight and satisfies all the numerous wise ones. That absorption is not the domain of any hearers or solitary buddhas, nor is it the domain of any bodhisattva great beings or a domain that could be understood by any sentient being. It is exclusively the domain of all the blessed buddhas’ wisdom. 
{{milestone:{label:6.6,id:UT22084-066-015-674}}}After the Blessed One had entered this absorption, the entire buddha realm of Sahā and all the trillions of worlds with their four continents, the trillions of Mount Sumerus, the trillions of suns and moons, and the trillions of divine abodes at the summit of existence appeared within the body of the Thus-Gone One. The entire buddha realm of Sahā appeared within the body of the Thus-Gone One. All the afflictions related to the physical and mental suffering of all the sentient beings present in this buddha realm of Sahā—the hell beings, the animals, those in the World of the Lord of Death, the gods, and the humans—were completely eliminated, and they all achieved physical and mental well-being similar to that experienced by the monks who have entered into absorption and reached the tranquility of the second concentration. All the bodhisattvas then arose from their absorptions, and the light was dimmed within their bodies. All the hearers and sentient beings who had entered into absorption likewise arose from their absorptions and experienced such physical and mental well-being. {{page:{number:187,id:UT22084-066-015-675,folio:F.184.b}}} They were all amazed and astonished. With their senses satisfied, they sat within the body of the Thus-Gone One and looked at the pores of the Blessed One’s body. They all saw that from one pore of the Blessed One’s body radiated light as bright as the light emitted by as many suns, moons, great precious gems, and tenth-level bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. Such was the light that radiated from each of the pores of the Blessed One. The light emanating from the Blessed One’s body filled all the buddha realms of the ten directions with its brilliance. All the blessed buddhas residing within the buddha realms in which a buddha was present then filled this entire buddha realm of Sahā with these utterances:

{{milestone:{label:6.12,id:UT22084-066-015-682}}}When the blessed buddhas had uttered this statement from their respective buddha realms, each of those thus-gone ones—attended and surrounded by bodhisattvas, great hearers, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, and mahoragas several times as numerous as the grains of sand of the Ganges—left their buddha realms and miraculously arrived in this buddha realm of Sahā to ripen sentient beings through the power of their compassion, to fulfill the intent and the aspiration of the thus-gone Śākyamuni, and to proclaim his qualities. Upon arriving, they circumambulated the body of the Blessed One three times. The beings present in the retinues of those blessed buddhas also circumambulated the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni and engaged in acts of worship. After that, they returned to their respective buddha realms. 
{{milestone:{label:6.13,id:UT22084-066-015-683}}}At that time, those beings in the buddha realm of Sahā who were present within the body of the Blessed One saw those thus-gone ones residing with their retinues amid the arrays of qualities of all the buddha realms of the ten directions. They saw them arriving from those places with their retinues, circumambulating the blessed Śākyamuni, departing, reentering their respective buddha realms, sitting at the Vajra Seat, and teaching the Dharma. In each of those buddha realms, {{page:{number:189,id:UT22084-066-015-684,folio:F.185.b}}} as those blessed buddhas were sitting at their seats while teaching their respective retinues about the thus-gone Śākyamuni’s praises, qualities, fame, insight, merit, diligence, compassion, and ripening of sentient beings, an innumerable and limitless number of beings—as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges—gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening and received individual prophecies. Others did the same with respect to the vehicles of the hearers and the solitary buddhas. All the beings present within the body of the Blessed One witnessed this and heard those prophecies. All of those beings who were sitting within the body of the Blessed One also perceived the different feelings of happiness and suffering experienced by the sentient beings who lived in empty buddha realms ripe with the five degenerations. At that time, all those who lived in those empty universes ripe with the five degenerations also perceived that light, and they saw the thus-gone Śākyamuni. They saw those countless blessed buddhas and the countless beings who accompanied each of those thus-gone ones circumambulating the thus-gone Śākyamuni within this world. At that moment, all those beings experienced sublime joy, and their feelings of suffering disappeared. Tenth-level bodhisattva great beings entered those empty buddha realms ripe with the five degenerations to ripen these sentient beings. In buddha realms with beings to be tamed by buddhas, {{page:{number:190,id:UT22084-066-015-685,folio:F.186.a}}} they assumed the appearance of buddhas and spoke of the buddha realm of Sahā in a single voice, a single utterance, and a single sound:

To worship Śākyamuni—

{{milestone:{label:6.17,id:UT22084-066-015-689}}}Those bodhisattva great beings, appearing like buddhas and accompanied by sentient beings possessing miraculous powers who were as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, then left those realms. They circumambulated the thus-gone Śākyamuni three times, worshiped the Blessed One with music from instruments made of precious gems and with different dances and songs, and then formed the aspiration to attain unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Some aspired for the vehicle of conditions, some for the vehicle of the hearers. All of them reached the level of nonregression in accordance with their individual inclinations. At that time, they reached different levels of absorption, acceptance, and recall in accordance with their individual practices. Then, after having accomplished a variety of roots of virtues, they returned to their respective realms. 
{{milestone:{label:6.18,id:UT22084-066-015-690}}}Some tenth–level bodhisattva great beings assumed the appearance of solitary buddhas, and some others took on the appearances of hearers, Brahmā, Śakra, the Four Great Kings, {{page:{number:191,id:UT22084-066-015-691,folio:F.186.b}}} Nārāyaṇa, Maheśvara, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, and universal monarchs. To ripen sentient beings, they then entered buddha realms where there were sentient beings to be tamed by hearers. There, they taught the Dharma to sentient beings while assuming the appearance of hearers. Everyone in those buddha realms perceived that light as well as the thus-gone Śākyamuni. They were filled with intense joy and delight, their senses were satisfied, their feelings of suffering disappeared, and they experienced feelings of happiness. Those who taught the Dharma in those buddha realms in the appearance of hearers were in fact bodhisattva great beings. Through the roots of virtue created by the accumulation of great merit, they spoke of the buddha realm of Sahā in this melodious utterance:
{{milestone:{label:6.19,id:UT22084-066-015-692}}}“Overcome inclinations toward negative actions

{{milestone:{label:6.25,id:UT22084-066-015-699}}}Those bodhisattva great beings, appearing like hearers and accompanied by sentient beings possessing miraculous powers who were as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, then left those realms. In this world, they circumambulated the thus-gone Śākyamuni and his retinue three times and worshiped the Blessed One by offering him a variety of precious gems, fine cotton cloths, Dharma robes, jewelry, ornaments, parasols, banners, flags, flowers, perfumes, music, praise, song, and dance. When they arrived back in their respective buddha realms, those bodhisattva great beings sat back on their seats. In the same way, they proclaimed to their individual retinues the praises and the fame of the thus-gone Śākyamuni [. . .] and the virtuous qualities of his activity of ripening all beings. In those buddha realms, the innumerable and limitless numbers of sentient beings present in these retinues gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Likewise, some gave rise to the mind set on the vehicles of the hearers and the solitary buddhas. All of them reached the level of nonregression. {{page:{number:193,id:UT22084-066-015-700,folio:F.187.b}}} At that time, they reached various levels of absorption, recall, and acceptance, and they created roots of virtue. All sentient beings also saw, in this buddha realm of Sahā, the array present in the body of the Blessed One. They were all amazed and astonished by the qualities of the Thus-Gone One. At that moment, those sentient beings—innumerable and limitless as the grains of sand of the Ganges—who had not yet given rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening gave rise to it. Similarly, some gave rise to the mind set on the vehicles of the solitary buddhas and the hearers, and they all reached the level of nonregression. The same happened with respect to all those who assumed the other appearances—up to those who appeared as universal monarchs—all the way to their attainment of the level of nonregression. This is how the Blessed One, who is endowed with great miraculous powers, rested in equipoise in the absorption that stems from the domain of all buddhas, in order to ripen all beings.

{{milestone:{label:7.1,id:UT22084-066-015-702}}}When the evil Māra saw all these thus-gone ones and retinues in their respective palaces present within the body of the Thus-Gone One, he became extremely unhappy. Dirt emerged from his entire body, and he began to weep out of distress. He started to run to and fro, to leave only to reappear, and to jump up, run and race around, gape, laugh, sigh, lick his mouth, close his eyes, stretch and contract his arms, {{page:{number:194,id:UT22084-066-015-703,folio:F.188.a}}} rest his head in his hands, and rub his throat and breast. When they saw this, all the sentient beings residing in the abode of Māra were unsettled. They became displeased and unhappy. One māra leader named Celestial Tree questioned the evil Māra with these verses:
{{milestone:{label:7.2,id:UT22084-066-015-704}}}“Why do you run around like that

{{milestone:{label:7.24,id:UT22084-066-015-727}}}However, none of the soldiers were able to move, so the leader Celestial Tree began to weep, and his hairs stood on end. With his palms joined, he supplicated the evil Māra:
{{milestone:{label:7.25,id:UT22084-066-015-728}}}“We are unable

{{milestone:{label:7.27,id:UT22084-066-015-730}}}Tormented by increasing suffering and distress, a thought arose in the mind of the evil Māra: “Now I must by all means bring to mind my demonic power, so that I can address all the nāgas in their abodes and make them upset and irate!” {{page:{number:196,id:UT22084-066-015-731,folio:F.189.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:7.28,id:UT22084-066-015-732}}}At that moment, the evil Māra manifested flesh flies, mosquitoes, and hornets in all the abodes of the nāgas, and he filled these places with disgusting smells. He made dirt emerge from the nāgas’ bodies, and everyone became unhappy. Upset, all the nāgas, the great nāgas, and the nāga women, boys, and girls started to look around and wonder, “Who is making fun of us?” They did not understand what was happening, as they could not see anyone. Overwhelmed by anger, all the nāgas, great nāgas, and nāga women, boys, and girls in this four-continent world left their residences. The two nāga kings Nanda and Upananda also left their residences with retinues of many hundreds of thousands.
{{milestone:{label:7.29,id:UT22084-066-015-733}}}Alongside Mount Sumeru, there is a mountain called Kalatiya. On the summit of that mountain there is a{{note:{index60,id:UT22084-066-015-734}}} sacred site of wise sages called Complete Support. It covers an area of forty thousand leagues, and it is ornamented with the divine seven precious substances. The nāgas entered that sacred site of wise sages to find shelter. However, as soon as they entered that place, their bodies became as small as the pin used to apply ointment to the eyes. Still, due to the power of their anger, they all perceived their bodies to be as big as Mount Sumeru. They could neither call out nor leave that place, so they just sat there, overcome by misery and anger. 
{{milestone:{label:7.30,id:UT22084-066-015-735}}}Similarly, all fifty-six thousand nāga kings of Jambudvīpa, including the great nāga king Sāgara and his retinue of many trillions, Airāvaṇa, Supratiṣṭhita, Takṣaka, Anavatapta, {{page:{number:197,id:UT22084-066-015-736,folio:F.189.b}}} Mucilinda, Samudradatta, Given by the Water God, Given by a Householder, Given by the River, Apalāladatta, Given by the Mountain, Gajaśīrṣa, Born from an Ornament, Elapatra, Invisible Wrists, Collection of Sounds, Strength of the Ocean, Karkoṭaka, High Snow Mountain, Strength of the Water, Blue Topknot, Pale Yellow Gold, Green Grass, Abused Tree, Bright Eyes, Elephant Extinction, Tīkṣṇadatta, Moving in Places, Bad Plough, Elavarṇa, Red Eyes, Attractive, and Supreme, entered that sacred site of wise sages to find shelter, each surrounded by retinues of many hundreds of thousands. In each of the eighty-four thousand continents, many hundreds of thousands of great nāgas also left their residences and entered that realm to find shelter. {{page:{number:198,id:UT22084-066-015-737,folio:F.190.a}}} Similarly, the nāga kings Body-Piercing Needle and Great Movement, surrounded by myriads of nāgas, great nāgas, and nāga kings, left Uttarakuru in the north and came to that sacred site of wise sages for protection. The nāga kings Moon Protector and Wealth Giver, surrounded and attended by many trillions of nāgas, great nāgas, and nāga kings, left Pūrvavideha in the east, and they too entered that sacred site of wise sages to find shelter. The nāga kings Endowed with Jewel Garlands and Endowed with Garlands of Light left Godānīya attended by myriads of nāgas, great nāgas, and nāga kings, and they also entered that sacred site of wise sages to find shelter. 
{{milestone:{label:7.31,id:UT22084-066-015-738}}}At that time, within these four continents and eight million other continents, there was not a single nāga or great nāga—whether born from an egg, from a womb, from heat and moisture, or miraculously, whether male, female, boy, or girl—who did not immediately come to that sacred site of wise sages; they all entered that place to find shelter. As soon as they entered it, each of their bodies became as small as the pin used to apply ointment to the eyes. However, due to the power of their anger, they all perceived that their bodies were as big as Mount Sumeru.
{{milestone:{label:7.32,id:UT22084-066-015-739}}}The evil Māra saw that all those nāgas had gathered in that realm and that their bodies had become small. When he saw this, he became exceedingly agitated, distressed, and scared. He said to his own faction, “Great demons, {{page:{number:199,id:UT22084-066-015-740,folio:F.190.b}}} all the nāgas have moved away. They have gathered at that sacred site of wise sages, and their power, appearance, and magnificence have decreased. Look at the overwhelming power of that spiritual practitioner!”
{{milestone:{label:7.33,id:UT22084-066-015-741}}}Another māra leader named Support of Discipline then said: 
{{milestone:{label:7.34,id:UT22084-066-015-742}}}“Do not be dejected. Listen to me!
This is a game of the nāgas.
Think about that great assembly
That will crush the son of the Śākyas into dust!” 
{{milestone:{label:7.35,id:UT22084-066-015-743}}}The evil Māra replied:
{{milestone:{label:7.36,id:UT22084-066-015-744}}}“Clever one, quickly go to that place
And generate enthusiasm in all those groups of nāgas!
If they are able to kill the son of the Śākyas and his assembly,
The domains of the nāgas will become most eminent.”
{{milestone:{label:7.37,id:UT22084-066-015-745}}}The māra leader Support of Discipline then departed from that abode of Māra together with eighty thousand creatures.
{{milestone:{label:7.38,id:UT22084-066-015-746}}}Since his previous aspirations had been accomplished, the thus-gone Śākyamuni had gained dominion over all wise sages. He was ripening all beings and gave teachings that were the outcome of the magical powers of all the domains of the buddhas. He was inducing weariness in all the bodhisattva great beings and bringing delight to all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, humans, and nonhumans. He engaged with this entire buddha realm, causing it to become the most magnificent of all the pure buddha realms and making it most fortunate, endowed with the great splendor that plants the seeds of merit, and worthy to be worshiped in all the buddha realms. 
{{milestone:{label:7.39,id:UT22084-066-015-747}}}The Thus-Gone One then interrupted the manifestation of his magical displays. While they were present inside the body of the Blessed One, the perceptions of everyone in this buddha realm were purified by him. {{page:{number:200,id:UT22084-066-015-748,folio:F.191.a}}} Now, as the Thus-Gone One interrupted the power of his absorption of miraculous transformation, which is an outcome of the domain of all the buddhas, he reappeared as he was before. He was extremely radiant, clear, and brilliant, and all the buddha realms were bathed in the light rays of his magnificence. Amazed and astonished, all the many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva great beings worshiped the Blessed One with offerings of flowers, perfumes, powders, precious gems, fine fabrics, Dharma robes, and necklaces, as well as a variety of ornaments and musical tunes. They circumambulated the Blessed One and sat in front of him. Similarly, the Blessed One’s hearers and all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, kumbhāṇḍas, pretas, piśācas, pūtanas, kaṭapūtanas, humans, and nonhumans worshiped him with offerings of flowers, perfumes, powders, precious gems, fine fabrics, Dharma robes, necklaces, and a variety of ornaments. They circumambulated him and sat in front of him to listen to the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:7.40,id:UT22084-066-015-749}}}At the same time, the māra leader Support of Discipline and his army of eighty thousand māras landed in Jambudvīpa, and they saw how the spiritual practitioner Gautama had interrupted the display of his vast body and that he was now again dwelling in the land of Magadha. They wondered, “Did his magical powers become weak because he is afraid of us? As he now sits there with his retinue within that assembly, is he not committing negative deeds by staying there because of us? {{page:{number:201,id:UT22084-066-015-750,folio:F.191.b}}} We must definitely go there right away and hear the reason for this!”
{{milestone:{label:7.41,id:UT22084-066-015-751}}}The māra leader Support of Discipline and his retinue then proceeded toward the place where the Blessed One was staying. When they arrived, they sat down before the Blessed One, and Support of Discipline uttered this verse:
{{milestone:{label:7.42,id:UT22084-066-015-752}}}“You have not yet crossed the ocean
Of severe disease, old age, and death!
When you deceive sentient beings in this way,
How could you have reached emancipation?”
{{milestone:{label:7.43,id:UT22084-066-015-753}}}The Blessed One replied in verse to the māra leader Support of Discipline:
{{milestone:{label:7.44,id:UT22084-066-015-754}}}“I have crossed the river of existence,
I am free from craving,
And I teach the Dharma to beings
Out of affection for them.
{{milestone:{label:7.45,id:UT22084-066-015-755}}}“A long time ago in cyclic existence,
You practiced for the sake of awakening.
You accomplished generosity and discipline
Since the time of Dīpaṅkara.
{{milestone:{label:7.46,id:UT22084-066-015-756}}}“You have venerated
Ten billion buddhas,
And I have given a prophecy to you
For the sake of the Supreme Vehicle.
{{milestone:{label:7.47,id:UT22084-066-015-757}}}“You have trained in the ascetic practices
And thoroughly meditated on the absence of marks.
I am giving you pure eyes,
So remember your past lives!”
{{milestone:{label:7.48,id:UT22084-066-015-758}}}At that moment, aroused by his past lives, aspirations, and worship of the buddhas and by all his roots of virtue, the māra leader Support of Discipline was humbled, like scattered grass, in front of the Blessed One. With tears in his eyes, he joined his palms and said, “Respected Blessed One, I am like a child, a drunk person, or someone who is mentally disturbed. I confess my faults. Respected Blessed One, I confess my faults! I now remember that, for a full uncountable eon, I previously engaged in the practice of the six perfections with great effort in order to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. {{page:{number:202,id:UT22084-066-015-759,folio:F.192.a}}} I repeatedly cultivated roots of virtue. I have previously served and revered a trillion blessed thus-gone ones in a variety of ways. I have heard the Dharma from them, and I made aspirations. Once, during the lifetime of the thus-gone Kāśyapa, a monk was requesting a discourse of the vehicle of the hearers. Without thinking, I then spoke these evil words: ‘Alas! This exposition on the hearers’ discourses in the presence of followers of the Great Vehicle, given while assuming the appearance of a spiritual practitioner is demonic!’ If I had not said those evil words at that time, I would have received a prophecy for unsurpassed and perfect awakening. However, due to the karmic residue of that action, I was born in the abode of Māra after I died. For five hundred seventy million years, and then a hundred thousand more, I did not have a single thought aimed at unsurpassed and perfect awakening, so what need is there to mention practicing the sublime states?” 
{{milestone:{label:7.49,id:UT22084-066-015-760}}}Repeating these words, the māra leader Support of Discipline apologized to the Thus-Gone One and his retinue. He then exclaimed, “From now on I would rather remain in the hell realms for as long as I have so far been circling in saṃsāra than let my mind stray from unsurpassed and perfect awakening!”
{{milestone:{label:7.50,id:UT22084-066-015-761}}}The Blessed One replied, “Excellent, noble son! Those who dedicate themselves to the mind set on awakening with a compassionate attitude are making the most outstanding gift to the great guides. Even the merit of lighting lamps as big as Mount Sumeru in front of the great guides would not match that heap of merit. {{page:{number:203,id:UT22084-066-015-762,folio:F.192.b}}} Therefore, adopt this attitude! Surrender this strong negative karmic action to me! Remember that the aggregates and elements are devoid of concepts and marks—they are conditioned! Then you will become a leader with supreme qualities.”
{{milestone:{label:7.51,id:UT22084-066-015-763}}}At that very moment, the bodhisattva great being Support of Discipline achieved the concordant acceptance with respect to phenomena. Then, he stood up, draped the body of the Blessed One with garlands made of invaluable pearl jewelry, and asked, “What are the qualities that will cause us to quickly understand all phenomena and destroy all views as if they were water bubbles? What are the qualities that will cause us to achieve the supreme acceptance set on awakening and quickly liberate all beings? What should the bodhisattvas cultivate for the sake of abandonment?”
{{milestone:{label:7.52,id:UT22084-066-015-764}}}The Blessed One replied, “Support of Discipline, the wise ones must quickly generate four qualities. What are the four? (1) Enthusiastically accepting boundless suffering for the sake of others, (2) undertaking the endless trainings of the buddhas’ domain, (3) undertaking them without letting them regress, and (4) quickly perfecting all the limitless buddha qualities.”
{{milestone:{label:7.53,id:UT22084-066-015-765}}}When they heard that teaching, supreme trust, faith, and respect arose in the minds of the eighty-four thousand māras in the retinue of Support of Discipline, and they sincerely apologized to the Blessed One. They also made aspirations to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and they all achieved the absorption that does not forget the mind of awakening. {{page:{number:204,id:UT22084-066-015-766,folio:F.193.a}}} They draped the body of the Blessed One with Dharma robes made of divine substances and then sat to one side.
{{milestone:{label:7.54,id:UT22084-066-015-767}}}When he saw this, the evil Māra became exceedingly distressed and scared. He shouted, “They have been consumed by the spiritual practitioner, so now I have lost those retinues! All those who left from here have fallen under his power, so no one can go outside anymore! We must remain here in this domain of the māras!” As he shouted this, he quickly closed the city gates and had guards protect them.
{{milestone:{label:7.55,id:UT22084-066-015-768}}}Then, with his sky-like vision, the Blessed One began to give extensive teachings about the three pure abodes—the focus on sentient beings, the focus on phenomena, and the absence of focus. All the nāgas who had found shelter and gathered at the sacred site of wise sages at the summit of Mount Kalatiya now noticed that their bodies had become as small as the pin used to apply ointment to the eyes, but they were unable to restore their bodies to their normal size. They became filled with fear and terror, and their hairs stood on end. So they all bowed toward Nanda and Upananda and supplicated, “When those flesh flies, mosquitoes, and hornets appeared in our towns, we all left our homes and entered this realm to find shelter. But now we are unable to leave again, and our bodies have become tiny. Please protect us so that we may return to our homes! Please grant us fearlessness!”
{{milestone:{label:7.56,id:UT22084-066-015-769}}}Nanda and Upananda replied: 
{{milestone:{label:7.57,id:UT22084-066-015-770}}}“This spiritual practitioner is deceitful.

He has entered this buddha realm {{page:{number:205,id:UT22084-066-015-771,folio:F.193.b}}}
And then absorbed it all into his body.
{{milestone:{label:7.58,id:UT22084-066-015-772}}}“He has manifested those flesh flies, mosquitoes, and hornets

{{milestone:{label:8.32,id:UT22084-066-015-864}}}The sage Jyotīrasa replied, {{page:{number:246,id:UT22084-066-015-865,folio:F.214.a}}} “In order to reverse the wheel of saṃsāra for the bodhisattva great beings, to purify the path of awakening, to teach the principle of cause and effect to sentient beings, [. . .] and to cause them to achieve the buddha eye, the Thus-Gone One—the omniscient sage who is the outcome of great compassion aimed at providing welfare and happiness to all beings—has revealed the supreme abodes that focus on what has only rarely occurred{{note:{index63,id:UT22084-066-015-866}}} and that, in common with the hearers, focus on sentient beings. For the bodhisattva great beings who attend to teachers, he also taught the sublime states that focus on that which arises from causes and on intellectual analysis. Right now, in countless buddha realms as numerous as all the smallest grains of sand in the Ganges, the Thus-Gone One is using the water of the Dharma to cleanse those bodhisattva great beings who master the six perfections of the unsurpassed vehicle as well as all other beings. He does this in order to free them from the ocean of saṃsāra, to subjugate the four māras, and to ensure that the lineage of the Three Jewels remains uninterrupted. The Thus-Gone One does not observe the realm of sentient beings who are afflicted by a multitude of conceptual afflictions. He is devoid of arising, movement, basis, characteristics, marks, attachment, determination, substance, darkness, light, apprehension, illumination, activity, and distinction. [. . .] He is devoid of wishes with respect to all the aggregates, the elements, the sense sources, and the great elements, as well as craving with respect to the nature of the eye that is devoid of a subject of experience up to craving with respect to the nature of the mind that is devoid of a subject of experience. He is devoid of formation and engagement. He liberates beings through the realm of phenomena, the limit of reality, the absence of cessation, the unadulterated suchness, {{page:{number:247,id:UT22084-066-015-867,folio:F.214.b}}} the realm of phenomena devoid of engagement, the ultimate emptiness, and the nonregressing sameness of all phenomena.{{note:{index64,id:UT22084-066-015-868}}} He is endowed with the conduct of perpetual wisdom, and he apprehends what is genuine. Right now, this thus-gone one teaches the sublime states devoid of reference point to the bodhisattva great beings who have fully trained in the practices of the six perfections, whose minds are equal to space, who have reached the sameness of unattached wisdom, and who have truly overcome the afflictions associated with the latent tendencies of all views.” 
{{milestone:{label:8.33,id:UT22084-066-015-869}}}Oh!

We were thrown into prison, and for a fortnight we were chained by five shackles and had nothing to eat. We supplicated the thus-gone Mandāravagandha without thinking about anyone else. Then, out of affection for us, the thus-gone Mandāravagandha appeared through a narrow opening in our cell. Through this manifestation of the magical powers of the buddhas’ domains, he taught us the dhāraṇī mantra that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes. Through the power of the Buddha, we heard this mantra from inside our cells—both the words and their meaning. By focusing our attention on this mantra, joy and faith arose in our minds. At that moment, all the karmic actions that otherwise would have ripened in our present existence, our next life, and our many subsequent lives was exhausted, as were all our karmic obscurations and our obscurations related to afflictions, phenomena, sentient beings, the perfections from generosity to insight, possessions, enjoyments, the exhaustion of life energy, intentional rebirth in saṃsāra, and going to the pure buddha realms. {{page:{number:251,id:UT22084-066-015-900,folio:F.216.b}}} As soon as we heard this dhāraṇī mantra that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes, our necks were released from the five shackles, and we miraculously escaped from our prison. We then flew in the sky and arrived in the presence of the thus-gone Mandāravagandha. After we passed away, we were born in the buddha realm called Mountain Light. We became renunciates in front of the blessed thus-gone Cloud Complexion, and for countless eons thereafter we were not born in empty buddha realms.

They are obscured by impure actions within pure buddha realms, and so they are unable to escape from their condition. As soon as they hear the dhāraṇī mantra for the karmic actions of sentient beings, all their karmic actions that would otherwise ripen in their present existence and in their subsequent lives will be exhausted, as will all their karmic obscurations and obscurations related to affliction, phenomena, sentient beings, the perfections from generosity to insight, possessions, enjoyments, the paths of the ten virtuous actions, rebirth, and going to the pure buddha realms. {{page:{number:252,id:UT22084-066-015-902,folio:F.217.a}}} Through this Dharma teaching, those sentient beings will achieve various degrees of acceptance and absorption. When they finally arrive at the time of death at the ends of their lives, they will be able to intentionally take rebirth in saṃsāra, and they will remember their past lives. They will constantly cultivate diligence and follow the paths of the ten virtuous actions. Without falling into mistaken views, they will exert themselves in the six perfections and in the four means of attracting disciples. They will listen to the Dharma, serve the Saṅgha, revel in the concentrations, develop the higher perceptions, and strive in the cultivation of the sublime states. Respected Blessed One, out of your affection for all sentient beings, please expound to us now the dhāraṇī mantra that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes, so that all those beings may never part from those qualities until they reach unsurpassed and perfect nirvāṇa!”

They want to overcome all suffering, to retain everything they hear, to be fully liberated from their physical, verbal, and mental negativities, and to protect the teachings.

They always have desire for the body, and they always want to control themselves{{note:{index68,id:UT22084-066-015-905}}} through body, speech, and mind. They want to accomplish the absorptions, the formless attainments, the higher perceptions, the sublime states, the dhāraṇīs, and various types of acceptances. However, since they are mainly propelled by their various karmic and afflictive obscurations, and by all the obscurations up to the obscurations related to going to the pure buddha realms and taking intentional rebirth in saṃsāra, they are unable to accomplish the various roots of virtue quickly. This is because they are afflicted by those karmic obscurations. 
{{milestone:{label:9.24,id:UT22084-066-015-906}}}“Those beings should wash themselves, wear clean clothes, and eat pure food. Then, on the auspicious eighth day of the month, whether they are sitting cross-legged on a clean bed or up walking, if they contemplate the physical form of the Buddha with no other thought or action and with no distraction, they will come to behold the Buddha in his own appearance if they can do this anywhere from one night up to seven nights. If they think of the Buddha’s body as being small, they will perceive it as being small in the exact same way, and if they think that it is limitless, they will perceive it as being limitless. During the whole night, they will see his thirty-two major marks. While visualizing a single mark from which blue color radiates, they should recite this mantra:

{{milestone:{label:9.26,id:UT22084-066-015-909}}}As that blue light radiates and spreads out, it is absorbed into the crowns of their own heads. They should then maintain this visualization undistractedly for one night while reciting those words without being scared or frightened. They should then perceive their bodies as fire. How should they do so? They should see that the dazzling blue light penetrates all the major and minor limbs of their bodies and that the whole of their bodies is consumed by blazing fire until it is reduced to ashes. They should then visualize the wind completely blowing the ashes away in the four directions, until everything becomes empty. When no physical forms appear anymore in any direction, the final accomplishment of that practice is reached. Noble son, if beings have thoroughly cultivated this recollection of the Buddha—the dhāraṇī mantra that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes—and properly performed and contemplated this act of worship, all their karmic obscurations, as well as their obscurations related to afflictions and phenomena and all their other obscurations, will be purified. This does not include acts with immediate retribution, the abandonment of the sacred Dharma, and the denigration of the noble ones.

If they want to cultivate the four concentrations, the higher bases of miraculous displays, the four sublime states, the four correct knowledges, and the four formless attainments, they will be able to become fully trained in them in a single day and night. If they want, they will be able to clearly know in a single instant all the deaths, rebirths, and mental activities of all beings in the three times. {{page:{number:255,id:UT22084-066-015-911,folio:F.218.b}}} If they want, they will be able to fill the entirety of space in a single instant with their own bodies, with the bodies of buddhas, Śakra, Brahmā, Nārāyaṇa, Maheśvara, the Four Great Kings, or universal monarchs, or with water, fire, or earth. If they want, they will be able to fill the entirety of space in a single instant with all kinds of flowers, garlands of gems, perfumes, parasols, banners, flags, fine fabrics, Dharma robes, and ornaments. All the limitless karmic actions of those who have thoroughly cultivated, mingled their minds with, and contemplated this recollection of the Buddha that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes will be purified without exception. Their merit, power, diligence, absorption, retention, acceptance, miraculous displays, and higher perceptions will become limitless. All those who have perfected this practice in that way will quickly be liberated from saṃsāra—except for those who have committed the acts with immediate retribution, abandoned the sacred Dharma, or denigrated the noble ones. This being so, even if those who have committed the acts with immediate retribution, abandoned the sacred Dharma, or denigrated the noble ones cultivate for seven weeks, in accordance with the way it is taught here, this recollection of the Buddha that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes, when those seven weeks have passed, not only will a third of their karmic obscurations be exhausted—they will all be purified without remainder.

They will be freed from the tight shackles of their prisons. All those who suffer will be freed from suffering. They will be freed from the sufferings related to possessions, punishments, beatings, precipices, fire, water, poison, enemies, and bhūtas and from the fears associated with diseases, places, kings, servants, and the lower realms. This will be the cause for them to be born within the happy destinies. If someone merely hears this recollection of the Buddha that focuses the attention on the four highest abodes, faith will arise in that person upon examination. This in itself is already highly meaningful and beneficial, let alone cultivating this practice in the way it is taught!”

Among the countless beings present, some settled within the practice of the successive attainments and the first fruition, while others achieved the other fruitions up to the level of a worthy one.

When they heard it, their female properties disappeared, and they attained male properties. All those among them who had purified themselves in the past achieved the absorption of the Buddha’s recollection and developed the qualities that have been described above. They all assumed the appearance of mahābrahmās. Each of them was surrounded and attended by retinues of many trillions playing billions of instruments and drums as they flew away from the inconceivable arrays in the abode of Māra and landed in front of the Blessed One.

{{milestone:{label:10.22,id:UT22084-066-015-947}}}As soon as the Blessed One sat down on the summit of Mount Sumeru, a hundred thousand retinues took place along eighty-four leagues of that mountain. Above the Blessed One, {{page:{number:262,id:UT22084-066-015-948,folio:F.222.a}}} the gods of the desire and form realms emanated a storied mansion made of the divine seven precious substances that stretched all the way up to the divine abode of the Highest Heaven. It was multicolored, delightful to behold, and adorned all along its many hundreds of thousands of leagues. To worship the Blessed One, they also manifested a variety of divine fabrics, ornaments, embroideries, parasols, banners, flags, perfumes, and flowers to adorn him.
{{milestone:{label:10.23,id:UT22084-066-015-949}}}Then, the Blessed One summoned Śakra, lord of the gods, and said to him, “Kauśika, I, buddhas, bodhisattva great beings, great hearers, sages, māras, gods renowned for their great power, nāgas, yakṣas, humans, and nonhumans have resided in the buddha realm of Sahā. Similarly, the Thus-Gone One himself now resides here on Mount Sumeru, as do those bodhisattva great beings who have come from all the buddha realms of the ten directions and those gods renowned for their great power. May the beings residing on the summit of Mount Sumeru bring you welfare and happiness!”
{{milestone:{label:10.24,id:UT22084-066-015-950}}}Śakra replied, “Respected Blessed One, since you act out of affection for us, and since all of us—māras, Śakra, Brahmā, lords of the gods, lords of the nāgas, lords of the yakṣas, lords of the gandharvas, lords of the asuras, lords of the garuḍas, lords of the kinnaras, lords of the mahoragas, {{page:{number:263,id:UT22084-066-015-951,folio:F.222.b}}} sentient beings renowned for great power, divine sages, and human sages—have assembled here in this buddha realm of Sahā to pay homage to the Blessed One, revere him, and bring him enjoyment as he resides on Mount Sumeru, we will all meet with great welfare and happiness here!”
{{milestone:{label:10.25,id:UT22084-066-015-952}}}While sitting there, the Blessed One smiled, and various blue, yellow, red, white, violet, and crystalline light rays radiated from his mouth. Those light rays spread out and pervaded all the buddha realms of the billions of abodes of Māra, Śakra, Brahmā, and everyone else, including the rulers of the gods, the asuras, and the sages. In those abodes, all the beings renowned for their great power who were given the names Māra up to sages were touched by the light. They all left their abodes and instantly arrived at the summit of Mount Sumeru before the Blessed One and his six buddha emanations.
{{milestone:{label:10.26,id:UT22084-066-015-953}}}The Blessed One then ceased his emanations and declared, “Among all the billions of Mount Sumerus present in my buddha realm, I have explained that this Mount Sumeru is the most supreme and eminent. All the great assemblies reside on this Mount Sumeru—it is the king of all Mount Sumerus!”
{{milestone:{label:10.27,id:UT22084-066-015-954}}}When they heard this, Śakra (Kauśika) and everyone else including Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, became elated and overjoyed. 
{{milestone:{label:10.28,id:UT22084-066-015-955}}}Through the power of the Blessed One, the four great nāga kings then left the sacred site of wise sages. With his tail still resting in the great southern ocean, {{page:{number:264,id:UT22084-066-015-956,folio:F.223.a}}} the nāga king Sāgara stretched his head up to the summit of Mount Sumeru, where he gazed one-pointedly at the Blessed One. Similarly, with their tails resting respectively in the great western, northern, and eastern oceans, the nāga kings Precious Protector, Body-Piercing Needle, and Harsh to the Moon stretched their heads up to the summit of Mount Sumeru, where they all gazed one-pointedly at the Blessed One. The remaining countless trillions of nāgas were unable to leave, and so they supplicated stealthily, “Please protect us and liberate us from this prison!”
{{milestone:{label:10.29,id:UT22084-066-015-957}}}The nāga kings Nanda and Upananda thought, “The Blessed One will descend to the ground from the summit of Mount Sumeru. He will then reside here and teach the Dharma to the nāgas.” With this in mind, they both stretched their own bodies from the ground all the way up to the summit of Mount Sumeru.
{{milestone:{label:10.30,id:UT22084-066-015-958}}}Śakra thought, “Oh! The bodies of those nāgas are rough and dangerous to touch. It would be terrible if they were to harm the soles of the Blessed One’s feet!” With this in mind, he then draped the bodies of the nāgas in divine fabrics, and their heads with powders made of the finest sandalwood and leaves of tamāla trees. He also tossed divine flowers onto them.
{{milestone:{label:10.31,id:UT22084-066-015-959}}}The Blessed One now expanded the size of the sacred site of wise sages to a width of eighty-four quintillion leagues, and in the middle of it Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, spread cushions adorned with divine fabrics, ornaments, jewels, and precious gems.
{{milestone:{label:10.32,id:UT22084-066-015-960}}}At that moment, while sitting on the summit of Mount Sumeru, the Blessed One said to Ājñātakauṇḍinya, {{page:{number:265,id:UT22084-066-015-961,folio:F.223.b}}} “I teach the Dharma through the magical and transformative power of the buddhas’ domain, so that everyone throughout the entire buddha realm of Sahā may hear it. Kauṇḍinya, clinging to the arising, continuation, origination, and appropriation of the eye is the arising of suffering. It is a disease and the perpetuation of the factors of existence. It is the manifestation of old age and death. Kauṇḍinya, clinging to the arising, continuation, origination, and appropriation of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind is the arising of suffering.

By transcending saṃsāra I have become renowned as the unsurpassed one. Through my generosity, discipline, and restraint I have become renowned as the one who is impartial toward all beings. That Dharma is the outcome of the cultivation of such generosity, discipline, and restraint, as well as sublime states and the eightfold path of the noble ones. {{page:{number:266,id:UT22084-066-015-963,folio:F.224.a}}} That Dharma I have taught and elucidated to all beings on a vast scale.

Therefore, in order to eradicate old age and death, you must practice and exert yourselves in the wilderness, under trees, in charnel grounds, in the mountains, in hermitages, and in secluded places! This is my teaching.”
{{milestone:{label:10.34,id:UT22084-066-015-964}}}When the Blessed One delivered this Dharma teaching, myriads of sentient beings in each of the four continents in all the billions of four-continent worlds in this buddha realm of Sahā generated a variety of roots of virtue. Some settled within states of absorption, retention, and acceptance. Likewise, some gave rise to the Dharma eye with respect to phenomena. In some the karmic obscurations that would have led them to the hell realms were purified. In others the karmic obscurations that would have led them to be born into the hell realms, as animals or destitute yakṣas, or as poor humans were purified. Those who were afflicted by diseases recovered their health, and sentient beings were liberated from their prisons. 
{{milestone:{label:10.35,id:UT22084-066-015-965}}}The nāga king Sāgara then uttered these verses to the Blessed One:

Pure golden conduct, and immaculate compassion.

Chapter Eleven
{{milestone:{label:11.1,id:UT22084-066-015-972}}}While showering rains of flowers, precious gems, and Dharma robes, playing instruments and drums, and singing melodious songs, all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and asuras present there departed from the summit of Mount Sumeru together with the Blessed One. Attended by his saṅgha of hearers and surrounded by his saṅgha of bodhisattvas, the Blessed One then took a seat on the cushions that had been prepared for him at the center of the sacred site of wise sages. To worship the Blessed One, all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, and kinnaras showered rains of various ornaments, powders, flowers, and precious gems from the sky. The nāgas also offered the Blessed One different kinds of flowers, perfumes, precious gems, silken clothes, fine fabrics, Dharma robes, and ornaments. They circumambulated him three times, prostrated to his feet, and sat in front of him to listen to the Dharma. The nāga king Sāgara then asked, “Respected Blessed One, what are the deeds through which sentient beings are born as nāgas?”
{{milestone:{label:11.2,id:UT22084-066-015-973}}}The Blessed One replied, {{page:{number:268,id:UT22084-066-015-974,folio:F.225.a}}} “Nāga lord, there are ten types of karmic obscurations through which beings will quickly be born as nāgas. What are those ten? (1) There are sentient beings who exert themselves in the six perfections and pursue the unsurpassed vehicle but are not quick to regard pleasures as defects, even though they strive in generosity and give freely. Through the power of their aspirations, they will be born among the nāgas. (2) There are sentient beings who pursue the unsurpassed vehicle and exert themselves in the perfection of generosity but are unable to guard their discipline perfectly and in a faultless manner. Fearing the conditions of the hell beings and pretas, they will be born among the nāgas through their aspirations. (3) There are sentient beings who pursue the unsurpassed vehicle but are filled with intense pride. Due to the power of this pride, they will be born among the nāgas through their aspirations. (4) There are sentient beings who exert themselves in the conduct of the unsurpassed vehicle but have a lot of aggression in them and are extremely hostile toward others. Due to the feelings of enmity they entertain, they will form the wish to be born among the nāgas just before they die. They will thus be born there through their aspirations. (5) There are sentient beings who genuinely follow the vehicle of the hearers, search for those who are worthy of gifts, and are endowed with an attitude of worship. They may also be born among the nāgas through their own aspirations. (6) There are sentient beings who possess the defects of miserliness and pride. They will be born among the nāgas through their actions. (7) There are sentient beings who delight in pride, talk nonsense, and lie. They will be born among the nāgas through their actions. (8) There are many sentient beings who do not revere the Buddha, the Dharma, {{page:{number:269,id:UT22084-066-015-975,folio:F.225.b}}} the Saṅgha, the precepts, the preceptors, the teachers, the ones who should be respected, and their parents. Due to pride and the delusion induced by inferior actions of body, speech, and mind, they will be born among the nāgas. (9) There are sentient beings who, overwhelmed by pride and ignorance, lack control and do not behave faultlessly. They will be born among the nāgas. (10) Finally, there are sentient beings who are proud and who are used to slander and to speaking with abusive words. After they die, they will also be born among the nāgas. 
{{milestone:{label:11.3,id:UT22084-066-015-976}}}“There are three other circumstances through which one will be born among the nāgas. What are those three? (1) There are sentient beings who are born among hell beings due to extremely severe negative actions of body, speech, and mind. After they die, they will be born among the nāgas due to a small residue of those negative actions. The same concerns the births among (2) animals and (3) pretas. Through those three circumstances, one will be born among the nāgas.”
{{milestone:{label:11.4,id:UT22084-066-015-977}}}Sāgara said, “Respected Blessed One, that is correct! Respected Well-Gone One, that is correct! Respected Blessed One, there are nāgas in this place who have an abundance of possessions and enjoyments and are like gods, while others are like wretched humans struck by plague, like pretas, animals, or even hell beings. They experience terrible suffering!”
{{milestone:{label:11.5,id:UT22084-066-015-978}}}The nāga prince named Lotus Face then asked, “Which actions have led me to be born within a family of nāgas and {{page:{number:270,id:UT22084-066-015-979,folio:F.226.a}}} with a blazing body? Everything I touch with my body—even with the slightest brush—burns and is consumed by flames. I must always walk without sandals and move around naked. My parents enjoy perfect prosperity and an exalted status, similar to that experienced by universal monarchs ruling over the four continents.”
{{milestone:{label:11.6,id:UT22084-066-015-980}}}The Blessed One replied, “O, nāga! In the past, thirty-one eons ago, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, blessed Śikhin, appeared in the world. At that time, there was a king named Free of Flowers. For three months, he offered all sorts of supplies to the thus-gone Śikhin and his retinue—saṅghas of hearers and bodhisattvas counting many hundreds of thousands of members—and he listened to the Dharma continuously. He made the aspiration to reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. He also built the Blessed One a fully functional temple. King Free of Flowers had a son named Arjuna. Because of his intense fear of saṃsāra, this son became a renunciate in the presence of the Blessed One, and he then looked after the monastic compound of the saṅgha that his father had donated. Later on, the son of the king Free of Flowers—the monk Arjuna—became jealous of all the hearers of the Blessed One, those monks who were residing there while partaking of food, beverages, and bedding. Those monks, the hearers of the Blessed One, eventually left the place. Arjuna was extremely delighted by their departure, but he could neither partake of these provisions himself nor give them away to others. After he died, that monk was born within the great hells. For many trillions of years, {{page:{number:271,id:UT22084-066-015-981,folio:F.226.b}}} he was boiled in those great hells. When he finally died and transmigrated from those hells, he was then born among the pretas, where he experienced suffering for many hundreds of thousands of years. After that, he again experienced further suffering among hell beings and pretas.
{{milestone:{label:11.7,id:UT22084-066-015-982}}}“Nāga, if you think that this person Arjuna—who became a renunciate out of fear of saṃsāra and then suffered in the three lower realms for such a long time after he died—was anyone else, then you should not think that! Because it is you who are afflicted by such strong karmic obscurations. From then on and for thirty-one eons, you have continuously been born in the three lower realms. Due to the residue of those karmic obscurations, you have now been born among the nāgas. It was you who experienced those sufferings and no one else. In the future, after you die, it is likely that you will again be tormented continuously by suffering among the hell beings, animals, and pretas.”
{{milestone:{label:11.8,id:UT22084-066-015-983}}}Utterly distressed, the nāga started to weep. He prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and exclaimed, “Respected Blessed One, I confess all the faults I have committed out of foolishness, delusion, confusion, and lack of intelligence! I confess each of my faults! Respected Blessed One, I will embrace the vows willingly! I wish to be a lay practitioner of the Thus-Gone One! I will renounce killing for as long as I live! I go for refuge in the Blessed One!”
{{milestone:{label:11.9,id:UT22084-066-015-984}}}The Blessed One replied, “Excellent, noble son, excellent! Since you have gone for refuge in me with such determination, all the lower realms are now exhausted for you. After you die, you will achieve a human body during the time of Maitreya. {{page:{number:272,id:UT22084-066-015-985,folio:F.227.a}}} You will become a renunciate in the presence of Maitreya and actualize the fruitions up to the level of the worthy ones. King Free of Flowers, who at that time revered Śikhin and his retinue for three months by offering all sorts of supplies and built a fully functional monastic compound for the saṅgha, was no one but this very nāga king Sāgara. Do not think that this was someone else! For thirty-one eons, he was never born in the lower realms but instead experienced divine glory and excellent fortune on an extremely vast scale. He was born here among the nāgas through the power of his aspirations for the unsurpassed vehicle, and he now experiences such glory and fortune in this place.”
{{milestone:{label:11.10,id:UT22084-066-015-986}}}When they heard those words, all the nāgas became weary and extremely unhappy. They developed the utmost respect and fondness for the Blessed One. Among the nāgas, there was one nāga named Feeble Fruit, who was blind. He started to lament loudly, “You who are affectionate toward sentient beings, please protect us! For a long time, I have had the most terrible physical sufferings. Worms, bugs, and all kinds of other creatures are devouring me. I lack food and drink and am living in boiling water!”

Furthermore, the previous karmic obscurations of eight billion four hundred million yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, pretas, piśācas, and humans were exhausted, and their eyes also became immaculate.

{{milestone:{label:11.25,id:UT22084-066-015-1003}}}At that moment, the Blessed One said to Venerable Ājñātakauṇḍinya, “Kauṇḍinya, remember this dhāraṇī mantra—this great mantra formula—that accomplishes vision. Now and in the future, all the sentient beings who become blind or develop poor eyesight due to the residue of past karmic actions, disturbances of the elements, mantras, medicines, or poison should read aloud this dhāraṇī mantra that accomplishes vision and confess each of their actions. If for seven weeks they wipe their eyes while cultivating the recollection of the Buddha with a loving attitude toward all beings and without doing anything else, their eyes will become immaculate. People should commission this dharaṇī mantra to be written down and repeatedly read aloud if they have become blind due to the residual karmic actions related to the acts with immediate retribution, the residual karmic action of rejecting the sacred Dharma, the residual karmic action of denigrating noble beings, the residual karmic action of blocking generosity of the Dharma, the residual karmic action of destroying books, or the residual karmic action of destroying others’ eyes. They should also confess their karmic obscurations. Furthermore, they should blend together ocean foam, licorice, kaca herb,{{note:{index73,id:UT22084-066-015-1004}}} the three medicinal fruits, dried turtle heart,{{note:{index74,id:UT22084-066-015-1005}}} and honey. It should then be cooked and smeared around the eyes while they read aloud the words of this mantra one thousand and eight times. If for seven weeks they cultivate the recollection of the Buddha and produce images of the Buddha without doing anything else, all their karmic obscurations will be purified, and their eyes will become immaculate. {{page:{number:275,id:UT22084-066-015-1006,folio:F.228.b}}} If they build a monastic compound for the saṅgha where monks can reside, their karmic obscurations will also be purified, and later on their eyes will never be impaired within saṃsāra.”

Because we spent our time with our relatives and did not listen to the Dharma, we ended up misusing the flowers, fruits, juices, food, and beverages that had been offered to the saṅgha of monks.” Others said, “We misused that which had been offered in the four directions.” Others said, “We have misused that which we ourselves had offered.” Yet others said, “We were under the teachings of Vipaśyin, Śikhin, or Kanakamuni.” Some nāgas said, “We were householders under the teachings of the thus-gone Kāśyapa.

{{milestone:{label:11.62,id:UT22084-066-015-1047}}}The Blessed One replied, “O nāgas, it is not acceptable for you to use the possessions of the Saṅgha! This is close to the acts with immediate retribution! You will not be able to quickly confess such acts without having to experience their ripening. O nāgas, despite that fact, you must commit to taking the threefold refuge for as long as you live! You will thereby gain benefits and happiness.

Her mouth was filled with worms, and from it was dripping pus with a stench like putrid urine. Her lower body parts were similar to this. Her entire body was decaying, oozing pus, and covered with skin diseases and worms, and she was being devoured by flesh flies, mosquitoes, and hornets.

{{milestone:{label:11.65,id:UT22084-066-015-1052}}}The Blessed One asked, “What actions did you commit in the past?”
She said, “Ninety-one eons ago, under the teachings of the Victor Vipaśyin, I was born as a girl in a human family. Intoxicated by lust, I repeatedly wished to have sexual intercourse with those monks who had gone forth under the teachings of the Blessed One, in the temples of the Saṅgha and on the Saṅgha’s beds. I was not afraid of the consequences of such faults. Blessed One, since that time I have never again obtained the body of a god or a human. Instead, I have been constantly tormented by unbearable pain in the three lower realms.”
{{milestone:{label:11.66,id:UT22084-066-015-1054}}}The Blessed One asked, “Sister, where did you go when that great eon came to an end?”
She replied, “By the great winds aroused by my previous actions, I was propelled into other worlds ripe with the five degenerations. After those worlds were destroyed, I was thrown into this place. Blessed One, please protect me through your great compassion! Well-Gone One, please protect me!”
{{milestone:{label:11.67,id:UT22084-066-015-1056}}}With his two hands the Blessed One then lifted up some water mixed with medicinal incense for wounds and uttered words of truth.

I once asked a hearer of the Blessed One to lend me fifty golden coins on interest, assuring him that I would pay him back in the fall. He only gave me ten with a fee of eighty cowries, not the fifty golden coins I had asked for. Hence, overwhelmed by anger toward that monk, I took ten with a fee of eighty cowries and never paid him back. On another occasion, I went to a monastic compound in which there were resident monks and ate thirteen mangoes that had been offered to the Saṅgha. Through just the residue of that karmic obscuration, after I died I was born within one of the neighboring hells in this barren wilderness. My body was constantly covered by worms, pus, and blood, {{page:{number:282,id:UT22084-066-015-1065,folio:F.232.a}}} and I suffered the torments caused by hunger and thirst. Due to those nonvirtuous actions, after I died I was born in the great hells. After that monk died, his anger and miserliness caused him to be born here among the nāgas, in my armpit. He always moves in my body. Constantly overwhelmed by anger, he fills my body with his warm breath. Due to those causes, my body is continuously covered by worms, pus, and blood. Thus-Gone One, please protect me! Please liberate me from those hostile snakes!”

{{milestone:{label:11.76,id:UT22084-066-015-1069}}}The Blessed One replied, “Hey, nāgas! For those who use or give to others the flowers, fruits, leaves, food, beverages, bedding, plants, or tools that have been offered to the Saṅgha in one of the four directions, negative deeds will ripen. Since these acts are extremely heavy—almost as heavy as the acts with immediate retribution—no one is able to quickly eliminate those actions without experiencing their fruition! Nāgas, come here and go for refuge in the Three Jewels! If you do so, you will henceforth live in water.”

There are also some people who, fearing poverty and in order to free themselves from the prison of saṃsāra, became renunciates under the teachings of blessed buddhas of the past but later renounced their consideration of wholesome practices and recitation. Some such degenerate beings will rob and misuse the various items that have been offered to monks who abide by the Dharma. Others among them will give these items to householders. Both those groups will be tormented by suffering for a long time in the three lower realms. Seeing those shortcomings, I have informed and reminded my hearers of them. None of my hearers should give to householders the flowers, fruits, leaves, and plant extracts that have been offered to monks and to the Saṅgha of monks.

For the sake of food, they accused the sages of engaging in sexual intercourse and threw dust and ashes at them. Hence, the sages eventually left the country Rough Stone. When they saw that the sages had left, those beings rejoiced and were overjoyed. Do you remember how furious you became, and how you deprived them of their water by drying out the rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, springs, and wells in their country? In that land, the fire god also became angry and extinguished the fires of those beings, leaving them tormented by hunger and thirst.

Some planted the seeds of the hearers’ vehicle, some planted the seeds of the vehicle of conditions, and some gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Within that retinue of nāgas, six quintillion nāgas gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening that they had not previously generated. Throughout the entire buddha realm of Sahā, the great earth shook six times. 
{{milestone:{label:12.57,id:UT22084-066-015-1177}}}To worship the Blessed One, the bodhisattva great beings who had come to that place from the ten directions showered various rains of precious gems, fine fabrics, and flowers through the power of their different bodhisattva absorptions. They exclaimed, “This Assembly, which has never been heard before, this teaching on absorption, is truly amazing and marvelous! This is the second turning of the Dharma wheel of Śākyamuni! Respected Blessed One, we shall also remember this dhāraṇī mantra of this very extensive discourse—the great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun—and teach it to sentient beings in our respective buddha realms!” {{page:{number:305,id:UT22084-066-015-1178,folio:F.243.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:12.58,id:UT22084-066-015-1179}}}The māras, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, kumbhāṇḍas, pretas, and piśācas who had assembled there were also truly amazed. They played different types of instruments and offered the Blessed One all kinds of precious gems, fine fabrics, Dharma robes, ornaments, flowers, garlands, perfumes, and ointments.
{{milestone:{label:12.59,id:UT22084-066-015-1180}}}The nāga king Sāgara then said to the Blessed One, “Respected Blessed One, please look after us with affection! Please come to receive alms in our abode, the great ocean! There, my retinue and I will listen to this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun in its entirety—including its beginning, middle, and end—from the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:12.60,id:UT22084-066-015-1181}}}The Blessed One replied, “Nāga lord, the Thus-Gone One will not enter the great ocean at this time.”
{{milestone:{label:12.61,id:UT22084-066-015-1182}}}Sāgara said, “Respected Blessed One, how much merit does a noble son or daughter who listens one-pointedly to this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun generate?”
{{milestone:{label:12.62,id:UT22084-066-015-1183}}}The Blessed One replied, “Nāga lord, imagine that someone filled this entire four-continent world will all kinds of precious gems and offered it to the thus-gone ones. If another being listens with one-pointed attention to the complete great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun in its entirety, the amount of merit generated by the former being would not match even a hundredth, a thousandth, or a trillionth of the merit generated by the latter person. In fact, no number, fraction, analogy, {{page:{number:306,id:UT22084-066-015-1184,folio:F.244.a}}} or illustration would come close. Nāga lord, such is the scale of the merit generated merely by hearing this Quintessence of the Sun!”
{{milestone:{label:12.63,id:UT22084-066-015-1185}}}Sāgara then said, “Respected Blessed One, since you will not come to our great ocean at this time, if I write down this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun, now that I have heard it, and carry it with me, how many virtuous qualities will develop in the great ocean?”
{{milestone:{label:12.64,id:UT22084-066-015-1186}}}The Blessed One replied, “Nāga lord, in all the places where this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun is written down in its entirety and carried, ten benefits will manifest. What are those ten? (1) The homes and lands in those places will be filled with plenty of wealth, grains, possessions, and valuables and with all kinds of precious gems. (2) Furthermore, the six hundred million bodhisattva great beings who have gathered to venerate those great stūpas will come to meet, revere, worship, and serve all the homes and lands where this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun is written down and worshiped. There, they will completely pacify all disputes, fights, epidemics, diseases, famines, and the two kinds of armies, as well as untimely winds, rains, and illnesses.”
{{milestone:{label:12.65,id:UT22084-066-015-1187}}}At that moment, all six hundred million bodhisattva great beings exclaimed, “Respected Blessed One, we shall do so! In all the homes and lands where this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun is written down and worshiped, we shall completely pacify all disputes, fights, epidemics, diseases, famines, and the two kinds of armies, {{page:{number:307,id:UT22084-066-015-1188,folio:F.244.b}}} as well as untimely winds and rains!”
{{milestone:{label:12.66,id:UT22084-066-015-1189}}}The Blessed One then said, “Furthermore, (3) Śakra, Brahmā, the Four Great Kings, the twenty-eight yakṣa leaders and their retinues, Śrī Mahādevī, the great goddess Sarasvatī, the earth goddess Sthāvarā, and the medicine goddess Accomplished One and her retinue will continuously, day and night, look after and protect the homes and lands where this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun is written down.”
{{milestone:{label:12.67,id:UT22084-066-015-1190}}}At that moment, Śakra, Brahmā, [. . .] the medicine goddess Accomplished One, and their retinues exclaimed, “Respected Blessed One, we shall do so! [. . .]”
{{milestone:{label:12.68,id:UT22084-066-015-1191}}}“Furthermore,” said the Blessed One, (4) “beings who have revered many buddhas in the past, who are powerful and renowned for their great strength, and who are endowed with perfect generosity, discipline, and restraint will take birth in all those homes and lands [. . .]. (5) In those homes, sentient beings who are attached to the pleasures of the five senses will constantly exert themselves in the perfection of generosity. (6) They will delight in those who are suitable recipients of generosity. (7) Those places will be continuously pervaded by a rain of rich Dharma water. (8) The sentient beings living in those places will always exert themselves in following the paths of the ten virtuous actions. {{page:{number:308,id:UT22084-066-015-1192,folio:F.245.a}}} (9) The sentient beings living in those places will always be loving, compassionate, and free of desires. Finally, (10) sentient beings living in all those homes and lands will leave the three lower realms behind and be born within the higher realms. Nāga lord, those ten benefits will manifest in the homes and lands where this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun is written down and repeatedly read in order to worship me, so there is no need to mention the benefit brought about by the persons who recite it, elucidate those Dharma teachings, and abide by the Dharma! Even if I were to describe such a mass of merit for a hundred eons, this would not be an easy task! Nāga lord, such is the depth of this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun. Such is the great quality and the great benefit of this great instruction of The Quintessence of the Sun!”
{{milestone:{label:12.69,id:UT22084-066-015-1193}}}When the Blessed One had said this, the bodhisattva great beings who had come from all the buddha realms of the ten directions and all the māras, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, asuras, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, kumbhāṇḍas, pretas, piśācas, pūtanas, humans, and nonhumans rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One with great exhilaration, joy, and delight.
