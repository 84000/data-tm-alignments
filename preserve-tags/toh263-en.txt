{{milestone:{label:1-3.1,id:UT22084-067-002-72}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in the Land of Activity. He was near the market town in the Land of Activity called Removing Impurities,{{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-067-002-73}}} on a mountain called Increasing Light, at the hermitage of the seer Wind Horse.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.2,id:UT22084-067-002-74}}}He was surrounded by a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks and by bodhisattva great beings who had emanated in the domain of the thus-gone ones by means of their unattached wisdom. All those bodhisattva great beings had developed the transformative power of immeasurable great love. With their immeasurable great compassion, they emanated to sustain the flood of beings. Through the transformative power of immeasurable joy, they showered down thoughts of comfort for all beings, satiating them. Through the wisdom of immeasurable equanimity, they were skilled in engaging with all phenomena being the same as the sky. With the strength of clouds of Dharma, special insight, knowledge, and wisdom, they were skilled in clearing away the dense darkness of ignorance. Through the four means of attracting disciples, they were endowed with the wisdom that can liberate beings from the four floods. Since they considered all beings as equal, they were loving, devoid of hostility,{{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-067-002-75}}} and had purified the path of the factors of awakening. They were genuinely engaged in the Dharma. They were experts in great wisdom. They revealed the supreme path to the world. They brought prosperity to beings, had dried up{{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-067-002-76}}} the river of craving with their roots of virtue, and were engaged in the activity of wisdom. Their moon-like supernormal faculties were the play of their knowledge of the great supernormal faculties. In order to bring them happiness, a wish that they know is the intent that all beings share, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-067-002-1197,folio:F.90.b}}} they displayed a vast array of skillful means. In order to fill immeasurable vessels with the precious Dharma using dhāraṇīs as vast in number to fill the sky, and because of their bodhisattva practice, they sustained all beings. With the great strength of their own feet, they had followed the profound path of the Dharma, using the four noble truths. They subjugated all opponents with the Dharma of sameness. They continuously manifested all the infinite qualities of bodhisattva conduct, which are attained after countless hundreds of thousands of eons of practice. Like the wind, their minds were untainted by any mundane or supramundane qualities. They had abandoned the afflictions associated with all the habitual tendencies, and they were experts in reveling in immeasurable and countless absorptions, retentions, and acceptances. 
{{milestone:{label:1-3.3,id:UT22084-067-002-77}}}These ten thousand bodhisattvas—which included the bodhisattvas Black Elephant Stallion, All-Illuminating Sumeru, Moon of Sumeru, Gaping Maw, Jñānaśrī, Blue Eyes, Roar of the Saffron Lion, Luminous Heap of Jewels, Boundary of Sumeru, Melody of the Emanated Banner, Mass of Lightning, Guṇatejas, Stainless King, Expansive Power of Sumeru, Powerful Wish for Belonging, and Maitreya—along with thirty thousand seers led by the seer Wind Horse {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-067-002-1198,folio:F.91.a}}} as well as 1,800,000 temple servants, were sitting together around the Blessed Buddha.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.4,id:UT22084-067-002-78}}}The Blessed One said to Venerable Svāgata, “Svāgata, while sitting on this lion throne that has been provided for the Thus-Gone One, I will deliver a hearer’s discourse to the hearers.”
“Very well, Blessed One!” replied Svāgata, heeding the Blessed One, and then he built a round pavilion for him.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.5,id:UT22084-067-002-80}}}The Blessed One then sat in the round pavilion that had been built for him and he beheld the entire assembly. At that point, the other monks stood up, draped their shawls over one shoulder, prostrated toward the Blessed One with their palms joined, and asked him, “Blessed One, what are these ‘worlds’ you speak of? Respected Blessed One, what are these ‘worlds’ you speak of? How is it that the Thus-Gone One names them by designating them as worlds?”
{{milestone:{label:1-3.6,id:UT22084-067-002-81}}}The Blessed One replied, “Monks, are you asking how many worlds there are that are known as worlds and how many the Thus-Gone One has named by designating them as worlds?”
“Yes, Blessed One.”
“Monks, listen carefully, pay attention, and I will explain.”
“We shall, Venerable One!” replied the monks, and they listened to the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.7,id:UT22084-067-002-85}}}The Blessed One then said to them, “Monks, there are two types of worlds: the world that is a vessel and the world of compounded phenomena. Monks, what is the world that is a vessel, and what is the world of compounded phenomena? All the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind are referred to as vessels. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-067-002-1199,folio:F.91.b}}} Monks, among those, there is the internal earth element. Monks, what is the internal earth element? Everything internal that has the characteristic of solidity—bones, nails, teeth, and so forth—is referred to as the internal earth element. What is the external earth element? Everything outside the body that is made of the earth element—cowrie shells, gold, jewels, pearls, beryl, conch shells, stones, coral, silver, fine gold, river rocks, pebbles, gravel, trees, grass, medicinal plants, dust, and so forth—is referred to as the external earth element. What is the water element? There is an external water element and there is an internal water element. What is the internal water element? Everything related to water and the water element in the body—bile, phlegm, pus, blood, brain, veins, saliva, tears, mucus, snot, marrow, bone fluids, and urine—is referred to as the internal water element. What is the external water element? Everything related to water and the water element outside the body—oil, milk, curd, buttermilk, molasses, tree sap, fermented drinks, gruel, sweetened beer, and wine made of flowers—is referred to as the external water element. What is the internal fire element? Everything in the body related to heat that lends beings their complexion; that causes the body to be hot, to steam; that causes inflammation, fever, and burning; and that digests what one has eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted is referred to as the internal fire element. What is the external fire element? The heat of a fire, the sun, and precious gems, as well as the heat produced by grains, medicinal plants, trees, grass, dung, and dust, are referred to as the external fire element. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-067-002-1200,folio:F.92.a}}} What is the internal wind element? The upward-moving winds, the downward-moving winds, the winds related to indigestion, and the winds moving in all the limbs that are possessed by the body are referred to as the internal wind element. What is the external wind element? Any external wind that swirls together, that spreads out, or that moves upward; the many harmful cold and hot winds that blow constantly;{{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-067-002-86}}} the winds that support the earth; and everything else related to the external wind element are referred to as the external wind element. In that way, those four external and internal great elements are known as the world that is a vessel.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.8,id:UT22084-067-002-87}}}“Of what are they vessels? They are the vessels of the five aggregates that are the basis of grasping. Monks, you should train to abandon all sense of interest in, delight in, love for, attachment to, the greatness of, possession of, and ownership of the four external and internal great elements. You should train in that manner with respect to all the four great elements of the past, present, and future, whether they are external or internal, big, small, bad, good, far, or near. You should regard those four great elements with correct insight and conclude, ‘They do not belong to a self, a self does not belong to them, and they are not a self.’ Monks, any monk who regards the four great elements in that way establishes them using correct insight. A monk who is extremely focused severs the stream of craving, weakness, and physical fetters, and puts an end to suffering. Monks, this was the world that is a vessel.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.9,id:UT22084-067-002-88}}}“Monks, what is the world of compounded phenomena? The five aggregates that are the basis of grasping are known as formations. What are those five? The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. Monks, this is the world of compounded phenomena. Monks, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-067-002-1201,folio:F.92.b}}}the world of compounded phenomena refers to those beings that possess and are composed of these aggregates, all of whom are included in the category of beings. Monks, you should train to abandon all sense of interest in, delight in, love for, attachment to, the greatness of, possession of, and ownership of the five aggregates that are the basis of grasping. You should regard all the past, present, and future forms—whether they are external or internal, and whether they are big, small, bad, good, far, or near—with correct insight and conclude, ‘They do not belong to a self, a self does not belong to them, and they are not a self.’ Similarly, you should regard all the past, present, and future feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousnesses—whether they are external or internal, and whether they are big, small, bad, good, far, or near—with correct insight and conclude, ‘They do not belong to a self, a self does not belong to them, and they are not a self.’ Monks, this is what is meant by the world that is a vessel and the world of compounded phenomena.”
{{milestone:{label:1-3.10,id:UT22084-067-002-89}}}Then the bodhisattva Samantāloka, who was present in the assembly, said to the bodhisattva Destroyer of Aggregates, “Venerable Destroyer of Aggregates, the five aggregates that the Blessed One taught within the world are the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. Venerable One, how is it that those are the five aggregates? What is the aggregate of form? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form associated with the eyes of the desire realm? Is there a cessation of form associated with the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as well as the eyes? {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-067-002-1202,folio:F.93.a}}} Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the eyes of the form and formless realms? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as well as the eyes? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the aggregate of form and the eyes of the desire realm? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as well as the eyes? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the eyes of the form and formless realms? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousnesses, as well as the eyes of the desire realm? Is there a freedom from attachment related to form that is associated with the eyes of the form and formless realms? 
{{milestone:{label:1-3.11,id:UT22084-067-002-90}}}“What about the past aggregate of form? Is there a freedom from attachment related to the past aggregate of form that is associated with the eyes? Is there a freedom from attachment related to past forms that is associated with the ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, and eyes, as well as the eyes of the form and formless realms? Is there one that is associated with feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness? What about the present aggregate of form? Is there a freedom from attachment related to present forms that is associated with the eyes? Is there a freedom from attachment related to present forms that is associated with the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as well as with the eyes, up to the mind of the form and formless realms? What about the future aggregate of form? Is there a freedom from attachment related to future forms that is associated with the eyes? Is there one that is associated with everything from the nose and ears up to the mind? How about everything from feeling up to the mind?”
{{milestone:{label:1-3.12,id:UT22084-067-002-91}}}The bodhisattva Destroyer of Aggregates then replied to the bodhisattva Samantāloka, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-067-002-1203,folio:F.93.b}}} “Noble son, look at the phenomena arrayed before you! The aggregate of form and freedom from attachment are not transferred to the aperture of the eye. The aggregates of feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness, along with freedom from attachment, are not transferred to the aperture of the eye either. The sense fields are nonconceptual, beyond thought, and nonarising. The aggregates completely transcend language and are beyond voice, sound, and expression. Why is that? Because, noble son, all phenomena are momentary and insubstantial. All phenomena lack a voice and are free from a voice. All phenomena are like a path in the sky—they leave no trace. All phenomena are wordless and without purpose. All phenomena are unborn and empty. All phenomena lack anything to be gained and are wordless. All phenomena are free from concepts and without moments. All phenomena are free from attachment and unconditioned. All phenomena lack sense contact and are without observation. All phenomena are free from views and devoid of characteristics. All phenomena are free from a cognitive basis and lack a self. All phenomena are devoid of self and inexpressible. All phenomena are devoid of words and utterly quiescent. All phenomena have no true nature and do not manifest. All phenomena lack appearance and are utterly without object. All phenomena are devoid of object and utterly rootless. All phenomena are without the sense faculties and utterly devoid of intrinsic nature. All phenomena are without activity and without antidote. All phenomena lack being and are devoid of attachment. All phenomena are utterly extinct and without fulfillment. All phenomena are without avarice and free from elaboration. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-067-002-1204,folio:F.94.a}}} All phenomena are endowed with concentration and free from movement. All phenomena are completely unobscured, free of dust—utterly free of dust. All phenomena are free from affliction and weakness. All phenomena are without beginning and nonexistent. All phenomena lack substance and are devoid of an agent. All phenomena do not exhibit activity and are devoid of feeling. All phenomena are endowed with space and are not heard. All phenomena are devoid of sound and intangible. All phenomena are dissatisfying by nature and insentient. All phenomena lack attachment to feelings and are like a mirage. All phenomena are free from perception and are like an echo. All phenomena have no essential nature and are like a reflection. All phenomena are free from radiant light like the reflection of the moon in water. All phenomena are free from reflected images and dependent upon reflected images. All phenomena are not apprehended as clouds—they are the same as the sky. All phenomena are reflections, invisible, nonexistent, and insubstantial, which includes everything that follows from lacking characteristics, such as lacking characteristics, being free of characteristics, bearing the same characteristic, and bearing a single characteristic up to being devoid of characteristics.{{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-067-002-92}}} All phenomena lack a self. All phenomena are not apprehended as a self, lack pride, are baseless, and are inexpressible. All phenomena are wordless. 
{{milestone:{label:1-3.13,id:UT22084-067-002-93}}}“Noble son, in order to eliminate afflictions and disturbances, you should think, ‘All compounded phenomena are momentary and free from destruction,’ as you cultivate the acceptance devoid of elaboration that brings no harm to oneself or others. Noble son, when bodhisattvas cultivate such powerful acceptance, they reach the acceptance that tames beings with the sky-colored method of perfect conduct. {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-067-002-1205,folio:F.94.b}}} Instantly and at the same time, the bodhisattvas who have attained this acceptance will emanate bodies in all the buddha realms more numerous than all the tiniest particles of dust. They will travel to those buddha realms throughout the ten directions, as numerous as the tiniest particles of dust, that are empty of buddhas and those inundated with the five impurities. They will rain down various things in each of those buddha realms such as a rain of food, drinks, clothes, ornaments, perfumes, flowers, and different precious gems as numerous as all those tiniest particles of dust. The beings who ingest those foods and drinks will achieve joy and happiness that is free from sensual desire; remember that all compounded phenomena are impermanent, are suffering, lack a self, and are empty; and they will develop discipline. They will then renounce the five sense pleasures and all of the trappings of home, leave, and go live without a home in mountain caves and dense, deserted forests. Wearing the clothes of seers,{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-067-002-94}}} they will sustain themselves on grasses, roots, and fruits. They will develop a sense of horror toward the five aggregates that are the basis of grasping, and enthusiasm for undertaking their task with diligence. They will regard those five aggregates that are the basis of grasping as being like a disease, an abscess, or a splinter, and as impermanent, suffering, empty, and lacking a self. They will attain the five supernormal faculties. They will become inclined toward the world of the Brahmā gods.{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-067-002-95}}} They will partake of the other rainfalls as well, from clothes to pure gems, and by perceiving them they will attain everything from joy and happiness that is free from sensual desire up to becoming inclined toward the world of the Brahmā gods.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.14,id:UT22084-067-002-96}}}“These bodhisattvas who have attained the acceptance that tames beings with the sky-colored method of perfect conduct will hold flowers with their cupped hands, flowers will be scattered across the sky, and flowers will instantly appear in buddha realms throughout the ten directions that are as numerous as the tiniest particles of dust, no matter if they are empty of buddhas or inundated with the five impurities. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-067-002-1206,folio:F.95.a}}} And in each one the melodies of as many gateways to the Dharma as there are minute particles of dust in a buddha realm will resound with the following song: ‘All phenomena lack melody and transcend the domain of the four māras. All phenomena are like a path in the sky, utterly baseless, and wordless. All phenomena associated with attachment do not arise. All phenomena associated with the afflictions do not cease. All phenomena that were not given up in the past lack characteristics. All phenomena devoid of attachment lack conditions. All phenomena that are devoid of fetters are baseless. All phenomena are effortless. All phenomena are without ownership and possession. All phenomena are without isolation or contact. All phenomena lack a self. All phenomena are everything from being free from a self up to being inexpressible. They are quiescent, unmanifest, groundless, objectless, completely rootless, and utterly devoid of intrinsic nature. They are without antidote, without nourishment, without dispersion, and without avarice. They bring about concentration and are utterly devoid of hindrance. They are without coming, weak, insubstantial, devoid of agent, without feeling, without the passions, without clinging, and without consciousness. They are like a mirage, an echo, an optical distortion, the reflection of the moon in water, and a reflection in a mirror. They are like space and insubstantial. They are everything that follows from lacking characteristics, such as lacking characteristics, being free from characteristics, bearing the same characteristic, and bearing a single characteristic, up to being devoid of characteristics. All phenomena lack a self, lack pride, {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-067-002-1207,folio:F.95.b}}} lack apprehension, and are inexpressible. All phenomena are momentary.’ You should cultivate the thought of accepting the fact that ‘all compounded phenomena are free from destruction.’ You should cultivate the thought of peace that ‘all phenomena are momentary.’ You should cultivate the thought of equanimity, the thought of utter peace, the thought that is devoid of clinging, the thought of nonorigination, the thought of the lack of hindrances, the thought that is uninterrupted, the thought that is not contradictory, the thought of the lack of support, the thought of equipoise, and the thought of suffering. The gateways to the Dharma that express tranquility, emptiness, and internal and external disintegration, as well as countless other gateways to the Dharma, will resound in those flowers.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.15,id:UT22084-067-002-97}}}“When they hear those gateways to the Dharma, beings will attain joy and happiness that is free from sensual desires; they will remember that all compounded phenomena are impermanent, are suffering, lack a self, and are empty; and they will develop discipline. They will then renounce all the fetters related to households and the five sense pleasures, and they will go live far from their homes, in mountain caves and thick, deserted forests. They will dress like seers and survive by feeding on grass, roots, and fruits. Thinking that the five aggregates that are the basis of grasping are terrifying, they will enthusiastically develop their diligence. They will regard those five aggregates that are the basis of grasping as being like diseases and abscesses, painful, impermanent, suffering, empty, and selfless. They will develop the five supernormal faculties, and they will become inclined toward the world of the Brahmā gods.{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-067-002-98}}}
{{milestone:{label:1-3.16,id:UT22084-067-002-99}}}“Noble son, the bodhisattvas who cultivate this acceptance do not apprehend a name, a being, a life force, a soul, a person, or form. There is no feeling, perception, or formation, and they do not apprehend consciousness. They do not apprehend the eyes, ears, nose, or tongue, they do not apprehend a body, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-067-002-1208,folio:F.96.a}}} and they do not apprehend a mind. They do not apprehend form, sound, smell, taste, touch, mental phenomena, the mental faculty, body, names, or the mind. They proclaim the acceptance of the nonaccumulation of emptiness, the absence of marks, the ability to withstand suffering, not abandoning the three realms, not being affected, the unborn, the absence of cultivation, and the absence of training. Nothing has been created and nothing will be created, which means that there is no activity in the past, the past is not present in the future, there is absolutely nothing in the middle of these, there is no basis, and there is no observation. When they cultivate this acceptance of mental nonengagement, bodhisattva great beings attain the acceptance that tames beings with the sky-colored method of perfect conduct. And by attaining this acceptance, they will activate the powers that were described above.”
{{milestone:{label:1-3.17,id:UT22084-067-002-100}}}When the bodhisattva Destroyer of Aggregates had delivered and proclaimed this teaching, the bodhisattva Absence of Concepts voiced his approval. The crowd of bodhisattvas remained silent, and the Blessed One gave his approval by not saying a word. 
{{milestone:{label:1-3.18,id:UT22084-067-002-101}}}Sixty monks then thought, “What was the noble son Destroyer of Aggregates thinking when he taught that all compounded phenomena are similar to those types of illusions? If form lacks a self, if there is no appearance, if nothing arises at all, if it is not engaged mentally, if it is without concept and nonconceptual, if there is no basis of observation and no material evolution, wouldn’t it be the case that there would be no being, life force, birth, soul, person, humans, living creatures, agent, individual who feels, others who feel, arising, production, dislike, or lack of nonorigination? On what basis would the thus-gone ones appear? Where would their compassion manifest? {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-067-002-1209,folio:F.96.b}}} Who would explain the Dharma? Who would know all phenomena? Who would maintain the precepts and vows? If there are no aggregates and if the results of virtuous qualities do not ripen on the basis of the elements and the sense fields, where do the results of wholesome and unwholesome deeds ripen? To whom do the thus-gone ones, the worthy, perfect buddhas, appear? To whom do the objects apprehended by the sense fields such as the bodies of hearers, solitary buddhas, gods and humans, and any other beings appear? We should stand up and leave this place!” And so those sixty monks stood up and left while the other monks remained silent. The bodhisattva Destroyer of Aggregates felt embarrassed, timid, and ashamed before the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:1-3.19,id:UT22084-067-002-102}}}Then the bodhisattva Lamp in the Hands, who was present in the assembly, inquired of the bodhisattva Destroyer of Aggregates, “Why did you teach such a profound Dharma to this talkative assembly? Noble son, as the Blessed One has said in other sūtras, there are Dharma discourses and lower discourses for five types of individuals: discourses on faith and lower discourses for those who lack faith, discourses on generosity and lower discourses for those who are stingy, discourses on discipline and lower discourses for those who are immoral, discourses on diligence and lower discourses for those who are lazy, and discourses on insight and lower discourses for those with confused insight. The Blessed One has also said in other sūtras that one should not teach the discourse on emptiness to those who have committed the acts with immediate retribution; the application of mindfulness to the body should not be taught to beings with wrong views; the application of mindfulness to feelings should not be taught to those who are greedy; {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-067-002-1210,folio:F.97.a}}} the application of mindfulness to the mind should not be taught to those who are proud, arrogant, and attached to food; the application of mindfulness to mental phenomena should not be taught to those who have abandoned the foundational principle of modesty; the qualities of rebirths among the gods should not be taught to those who wish to obtain a human condition; the qualities of rebirths among yakṣas who rob vitality should not be taught to those who are inclined toward rebirth among the gods of the desire realm; the magnificence of the gods who occupy the desire realm should not be taught to those who will take rebirth among the gods of the form realm; the qualities of occupying the form realm should not be taught to those who will take rebirth in the formless realm; the bliss of the gods who occupy the desire realm should not be taught to those who are inclined toward rebirth among the gods who occupy the form realm; the qualities of the solitary buddhas should not be taught to those who are inclined toward the vehicle of the hearers; the qualities of the hearers should not be taught to those who are inclined toward the vehicle of the solitary buddhas; the qualities of the solitary buddhas should not be taught to those who are inclined toward the Great Vehicle; the four means of attracting disciples should not be taught to bodhisattvas who are making real effort toward the perfections; the four special types of knowledge should not be taught to bodhisattvas who are making real effort in practicing the religious life; certain types of discourses on profound peace and emptiness should not be taught to silent assemblies of bodhisattvas; and this profound acceptance that tames beings with the sky-colored method of perfect conduct should not be taught in the presence of such talkative assemblies who follow the vehicles of the hearers and the solitary buddhas.”
{{milestone:{label:1-3.20,id:UT22084-067-002-103}}}All the numerous assemblies of bodhisattvas exclaimed, “Excellent!” in unison and the Blessed One also applauded the bodhisattva Lamp in the Hands with delight:

Through that absorption, the Blessed One appeared in the figure of someone with the observances, behaviors, and markings of a seer. The seer was an elderly man, quite old and aged, who had long matted hair and a long beard. He was holding a staff, a small water jug, and a straining cloth, and he was lighting a huge fire offering. From that fire emerged a multicolored light radiating infinite colors, many hundreds of thousands of colors—a vast range of pure and immaculate colors. That light rendered imperceptible and invisible the light emitted by the stars of countless buddha realms throughout the ten directions that are empty of buddhas and inundated with the five impurities, as well as the light emitted by precious gems, lightning, the sun, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and asuras.

The seers who followed the Great Vehicle could not see the hearers or the solitary buddhas, or those who followed their vehicles. Those who were present in the assembly of the hearers could not see the Thus-Gone One or the bodhisattvas.

It liberates beings through unwavering faith in the Buddha using the Great Vehicle, through unwavering faith in the Dharma using the vehicle of solitary buddhas, and through unwavering faith in the Saṅgha using the vehicle of the hearers. It teaches beings to abandon all false doctrines through noble and delightful discipline, it liberates beings from the ocean of life through generosity, it liberates them from the ocean of views through pleasant speech, it liberates beings from the ocean of afflictions through altruistic actions, and it liberates beings into the perfection of insight by having a consistent meaning.”

All the beings in those realms who followed the Great Vehicle heard them and gazed into the ten directions. They gazed out at all of the beings they could see in the four directions, looking for the being whose melodious waves of verse were so delightful, pleasing, utterly pleasing, and profound, and to see how one could utter such melodious waves of verse expressing the meaning, words, and letters that bring relief to beings, satisfy them, and lead them to the other shore of saṃsāra. Through the power of the Buddha, they saw myriad seers not very far away who were prostrating to the Sage on Mount Gandhamādana. His senses were pacified, his mind was tranquil and under control, he had reached supreme peace, and he was blazing like a heap of gold. When they saw him, they thought, “This seer is very powerful, and his great assembly of seers is endowed with great compassion. {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-067-002-1231,folio:F.107.b}}} Since he is compassionate, we should follow him!”

The crowd of magical bodhisattva emanations made up of various types of seers made offerings to the Sage, prostrated to him with their palms joined, praised him, and took their seats. Through the power of the Buddha, those who were born in the lower realms, due either to the power of their aspirations or to the conditions of their negative actions, attained each of the recollections, were dressed as seers, and took their seats. They all sat down with their palms together facing the great seer, the lord of sages.

When all forms of disintegration are abandoned, one achieves the acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.

Even when they do not travel to afflicted buddha realms, the beings who want to be born there but have no desire to purify the multitude of qualities of a buddha realm will be born there.

In this buddha realm inundated with the five impurities, if bodhisattvas recognize the 21,000 different expressions of desire in a single being, they will accordingly apply 21,000 different skillful means to pacify that being’s desires. If they recognize the 21,000 different expressions of anger in a single being, they will accordingly apply 21,000 different skillful means to pacify that being’s anger. If bodhisattvas recognize the 21,000 different expressions of a single fortunate being, they will accordingly apply 21,000 different skillful means to pacify that being. That is how bodhisattvas who are able to pacify the continual arising of the afflicted behaviors of a single fortunate being exercise great strength. When bodhisattvas who recognize the 84,000 different types of behavior that generate afflictions in a single being are brave and committed to steadfast effort, they apply the 84,000 skillful means. Look at the great strength of those bodhisattvas and what they overcome with their bravery! Just as they are able to pacify the afflictions of a single being, they can also pacify the 84,000 characteristics of the afflicted behavior of anywhere from two, three, or four beings up to all the beings living in an entire continent. Similarly, they can liberate all the beings from all their afflictions living on two and even four continents, up to all the beings living in buddha realms in the ten directions as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges. This is why it is said that bodhisattvas achieve acceptance in buddha realms inundated with the five impurities. {{page:{number:90,id:UT22084-067-002-1285,folio:F.134.b}}}

They know the characteristic of nirvāṇa, and the 84,000 various characteristics of the attachment of every being. This is why the bodhisattvas actually know the characteristics of beings’ behavior. Since they know the way they think, they are able to liberate beings who are bound by the shackles of the afflictions.

Forms, feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousnesses. Noble son, what is the aggregate of form? Noble son, it has eight aspects that a bodhisattva should think about and analyze correctly. What are those eight aspects, noble son? Forms are made of the four great elements; forms are diseases; desires have the characteristic of phenomena that disintegrate; whatever has the nature of disintegrating is impermanent; it has the nature of insubstantiality, emptiness, and annihilation; and both inner and outer severe, middling, and minor afflictions are eliminated. Bodhisattvas cultivate acceptance that has the characteristics of being impermanent, suffering, lacking a self, and being as empty as the whole of space. This should be regarded as the bodhisattvas’ acceptance that ripens and looks after beings.

Noble son, whether the four great elements are internal, external, big, small, inferior, blissful, far, or near, they should all be analyzed as not going, not leaving, not arising, not originating, lacking a self, and without ownership.

When bodhisattvas analyze a single extremely subtle particle with subtle special insight, they understand that this single subtle particle has the same behavior as all the afflictions, which are devoid of characteristics. They understand that it lacks a self and is free from aspects. They understand that it is insubstantial, free from words, without apprehension, and free from all spoken sounds. They understand that it is free from the lack of self, and that it has the characteristics of Māra. They understand that it is wordless and free from causes and conditions.

Whatever perishes is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Whatever does not arise lacks a self. Whatever is compounded is free from all language and empty. Since they correctly understand that the external and internal earth elements are empty, they pacify the severe, middling, and minor afflictions. The earth element lacks perception and lacks feeling in the same way that space lacks perception and lacks feeling. This cultivation of the acceptance that it has the characteristics of being impermanent, suffering, lacking a self, and being empty should also be regarded as the bodhisattvas’ acceptance that ripens and looks after all beings.{{note:{index:63,id:UT22084-067-002-459}}}{{page:{number:99,id:UT22084-067-002-1294,folio:F.139.a}}}

Bodhisattvas use special insight to analyze each and every water element of the internal body in terms of the most minute characteristics of water in a mere droplet measuring a fraction of the point of one strand of hair. From the point that they correctly understand that this drop is devoid of the characteristics of being big, small, inferior, or blissful, and that it is free from all afflictions up to being without characteristics, and they understand that all formations are completely pacified in a mere drop, this is how they correctly analyze a single drop of water using those eight aspects. They correctly analyze each and every drop using those eight aspects, from one, then two, and up to all of the water elements of the internal body. Progressing from their lack of characteristics to their lack of marks, they correctly see the external water elements, whether they be big, small, inferior, blissful, far, or near, as having the quality of perishing just like the internal water elements. Whatever has the quality of perishing is impermanent, and it is also not conceptual. Whatever is not conceptual is also suffering. Whatever does not arise lacks a self. Whatever is compounded is free from all language and empty. Since they correctly understand that the external and internal water elements are empty, they pacify the severe, middling, and minor afflictions. The inner and outer water elements lack abiding and lack elaboration in the same way that space lacks abiding and lacks elaboration. This cultivation of the acceptance that they have the characteristic of being impermanent, suffering, empty, and without a self is the bodhisattvas’ nurturing and ripening of beings. The elaborate discussions presented here in the contexts of the earth and water elements should also be applied to the contexts of the fire and air elements. {{page:{number:100,id:UT22084-067-002-1295,folio:F.139.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:5.22,id:UT22084-067-002-461}}}“Furthermore, noble son, the fact that forms are based on the four elements means there is reason to doubt them too. Whether they are internal, external, big, small, inferior, blissful, far, or near, they are all insubstantial, they are all like reflections, and they are all subject to the power of the six sense fields, from the earth element up to the cause of consciousness.

Bodhisattvas understand that they lack characteristics, that they are free from all afflictions, that they are free from aspects, that they lack a self, that they are free from mental formations, that they are devoid of words, and that they are free from causes and conditions. They understand that they are insubstantial and free from momentariness. They understand that all formations are without marks and without duration and conclusion. They understand that all formations are groundless and utterly pacified. They use these aspects to analyze forms as being insubstantial like a mass of foam. They see that everything is without characteristics up to being without marks, and everything has the quality of being perishable. Whatever has the quality of perishing is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is also not conceptual. Whatever is not conceptual is also suffering. Whatever lacks origination lacks a self. Whatever is compounded is free from all paths and is empty. Since they correctly understand that those inner and outer forms are insubstantial like water foam and empty like reflections, their severe, middling, and minor afflictions will be pacified. {{page:{number:101,id:UT22084-067-002-1296,folio:F.140.a}}} Just as space is not apprehended and is unconditioned, forms that are like water foam are also not perceived and are unchanging.

Since they know that all phenomena are included within the realm of phenomena, they understand that all forms made of the four great elements are completely indivisible, and that all language is baseless. They analyze forms as not going anywhere else, as not having a location, as adventitious suffering, as free from the two bonds of continuity and discontinuity, as like reflections, and as groundless. They analyze the characteristics of all forms as being like a mass of foam, without apprehension, without origin, and utterly devoid of intrinsic nature. They analyze the four great elements as being completely pure, without concepts, not originating, not fully established, and without engaging in any form of discontinuity related to the proliferation of all manner of qualities. They analyze the characteristics of the aggregate of forms that are made of the four great elements as being without conceit, without giving, without darkness, without light, without mental engagement, without duality, without accumulation, without elaboration, indivisible, like a reflection, indivisible, and insubstantial. They analyze the four great elements that constitute form as being completely nonconceptual, and as perishable like water foam. {{page:{number:102,id:UT22084-067-002-1297,folio:F.140.b}}} They use these aspects to analyze forms as being insubstantial like reflections. They see that all formations are lacking characteristics up to lacking marks, and that they have the quality of being perishable. Whatever has the quality of perishing is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is also not conceptual. Whatever is not conceptual is also suffering. Whatever lacks origination lacks a self. Whatever is compounded is devoid of all linguistic expression and empty. Since they correctly understand that those inner and outer forms are empty like water foam, their severe, middling, and minor afflictions will be pacified. Just as space is inexhaustible, formless, and indefinable, forms also have the characteristics of being inexhaustible, formless, undefinable, impermanent like water foam, suffering, devoid of self, and empty. The cultivation of the acceptance that is free from those apprehended characteristics should be regarded as the bodhisattvas’ acceptance that ripens and looks after beings.

They understand that the three realms of saṃsāra and the three times have the same characteristic of lacking a self and that they are not apprehended and are wordless, and they understand the position of nonduality, of permanence, of nonapprehension, of inexhaustible conduct, of the absence of afflictions, of the nonexistence of objects, of the absence of movement, and of inexpressibility, and that forms have the characteristic of being like a reflection.{{note:{index:66,id:UT22084-067-002-466}}} They analyze the appearances of forms of both the desire and the form realms as being like space.

In that way, they transcend all formations as they continually appear to the eye consciousness. Like a mass of foam, even those physical appearances are empty of the eye consciousness, as is their basis, the four elements that make up the eye. Because they lack a self, the four great elements are empty as well. As it was explained before, they not apprehended as a self. The eyes are like a bunch of grapes in that each eye is made of countless tiny particles, and those tiny particles are conglomerations of the four great elements. Since those four great elements are not apprehended as a self and not apprehended as existent, what need is there to mention perceiving them as the abode of consciousness or the way that things arise? Bodhisattvas correctly analyze elements that constitute the eye as conglomerations of various tiny particles like a bunch of grapes. By that thorough analysis, there is no basis or path of the eye consciousness. Bodhisattvas analyze the eyes of beings using that correct analysis. {{page:{number:104,id:UT22084-067-002-1299,folio:F.141.b}}} Those who correctly understand that the eye consciousness is empty will be free from attachment.

They do not entertain thoughts or concepts such as the four great elements, and they do not view them as apprehended. They do not see a being, a life force, a soul, a person, a human being, a living creature, a doer, an agent, one who feels, anything that causes feeling, or anything that is born, that is emerging, or that is fully arisen.

The groups of feelings are of six types: feelings that arise through eye contact, ear contact, nose contact, tongue contact, body contact, and mind contact.

Pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings, and feelings that are neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Those three types of feelings are referred to as the aggregate of feeling. Noble son, bodhisattvas should correctly analyze the aggregate of feeling using these eight aspects. What are the eight aspects? Noble son, there are three root afflictions—desire, anger, and delusion. Afflicted beings are not free from desires and their defilements have not been extinguished.

That is the way that one should correctly analyze feeling when pleasure arises. Just as before, when it was said that the eye is empty of the eye, those feelings that arise like water bubbles are fleeting, devoid of a body, groundless, without form, undefinable, insubstantial, and wordless.

When one apprehends physical, verbal, and mental formations, even the body is based upon the four great elements. As previously stated, those four great elements are unwavering, unchanging, lack a self, and have no sense of ownership. One does not apprehend language in them, and they have no words, and since one does not apprehend them as a self, they are groundless. The mental consciousness is also groundless, does not abide, and is a mere verbal designation. It has no self, no body, and no person. The apprehension of body, speech, and mind is also empty of duality. Therefore, even ignorance is empty. The indeterminate stream of thought does not go away. What appears to have characteristics is inexpressible.

If mental formations do not arise, the activity of the physical and verbal formations in the three times will neither develop nor be eliminated. If verbal formations do not arise, the activity of the physical and mental formations in the three times will also neither develop nor be eliminated.

The excluded marks and signs that are the object of the mind, mental faculty, and consciousness are not posited as something that is established.{{note:{index:84,id:UT22084-067-002-505}}} These four formless aggregates remain as images, but they do not remain as the images that are the objects of the aggregate of form. These four formless aggregates that are related to the subtle analysis of the characteristics of actions of the three worlds do not abide as object images. They are everything from being devoid of self to being without person. They are inexpressible, and they are wordless. Since these four formless aggregates have the characteristic of being empty, they instantly disintegrate and are not eternal. Since they do not apprehend an object, they are without marks. Since they instantly arise and decrease, they have no purpose. Since they do not cease, they activate insight that is devoid of attachment. Therefore, these four aggregates are empty.

By analyzing our own minds, we find that the realm of phenomena that is singular is thus differentiated in a variety of ways, and that it is imputed in terms of names, conditions, colors, marks, and shapes. The five sense pleasures are unborn, without arising, without characteristics, and without definition. The threefold liberation is the innate nature of a single element, the nonconceptual realm of phenomena in all of the three times, and discrimination that is like a path in the sky. Therefore, the object of the eye and the contact that is the object of the eye consciousness are free from engaging the three realms, marks, colors, and shapes, like characteristics that are imputed upon space, and everything one engages is the realm of phenomena.

The feelings arise from the arising of contact, but not in a single moment, and not in the moment of apprehending a single action. There are three types of feelings: pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings, and feelings that are neither pleasant nor unpleasant. As was explained before, one should understand that the three types of feelings associated with the six sense fields related to contact with everything in the three times and three realms are empty. Some say, ‘When the three types of feelings arise from the six sense fields related to contact, they are established through analyzing them just like the aggregates, and that is the view of permanence.’ Others say, ‘When the three types of feelings arise from the six sense fields related to contact, they are established in terms of the nonexistence of the aggregates, and that is annihilation.’ Both those views should be abandoned.

Feelings that do not conceptualize forms are like a flash of lightning and space. Perceptions are like wind and space. Formations are like a cloudless sky.

Bodhisattvas should analyze each and every detail in the same way as analyzing the great elements described before. They should analyze each of the five sense pleasures as one would analyze a pillar. Just as a pillar might stand in the sky but is not based there because it is supported by the earth, so too the basis, forms, are like a mass of foam. By apprehending forms and the absence of forms, {{page:{number:125,id:UT22084-067-002-1320,folio:F.152.a}}} one becomes involved with forms and the absence of forms, and one is not free from forms and the absence of forms. However, if one discards the activity of forms and the absence of forms, as well as the forms and the absence of forms themselves, and considers those forms to have no essence, like a mass of foam, one will find that they are empty. Whether they apply or they do not apply, words come forth from the mouth based on the condition of the breath. They are wordless and inexpressible, and one should understand that the sounds of the three realms are empty in the same way. One should understand the smells of the three realms in the same way that the breath contained in the body, the wind that courses through space, and space itself are without smells and empty. One should understand the quality of taste that oneself and the three realms possess is empty in the same way that a pot fills with drops of rain but there is no one who places the drops inside of it. No one accomplishes this. No one does this or causes it to be done. So, it is entirely without anyone who takes hold of it and attends to it. One should understand that the sense of touch related to the three realms is empty in the same way that a pot is not established as being conjoined with space. It is not in space, and space and the pot are free from contact with one another and are inanimate. The wheel of delusion regarding the five sense pleasures leads to craving some desire and craving some form just like a bee drawn to the smell of flowers.

Just as space, wind, and light lack words, are inexpressible, and move together without being attached to each other, so too nirvāṇa is inexhaustible. All phenomena are equal to nirvāṇa in the same way that nirvāṇa is neither an extinction nor not an extinction. One should not apprehend opposing factors in terms of lack of sameness and lack of difference. One should not create duality; after one understands that all phenomena behave in the same way as the realm of phenomena, one does not think that the realm of phenomena and ultimate reality arise or cease in the least. Thus, the nature of the realm of phenomena is groundless, and this is the ultimate reality. What is ultimately real is the nature of all phenomena. This is the position that circumscribes the three fields. It is the position that is without boundary or division. It is the position that is without annihilation and permanence. It is the position of things as they truly are. With this position one encompasses all phenomena. The extent of this position and absence of this position are not two things, because one does not apprehend the craving for existence. The position regarding all things, such as the life force, the being, the soul, and the person, is one of nonduality. The position regarding ultimate reality, the position of the transitory collection, and the elimination of craving are also nondual. And in that way, the position of the transitory collection is what eliminates desire. When one understands in that way, there will be twenty aspects to this view of the transitory collection. Ultimate reality is not the same as involvement with craving. Ultimate reality is without going. It comes to an end in the sense that when it has gone it is not extinguished and is not established, and so craving is the gateway to the inexhaustible because all phenomena are inexhaustible and have no inherent nature.

What is grasping? There are four types of grasping: grasping related to desire, grasping related to views, grasping related to discipline, and grasping related to the view of a self. What is grasping that is related to desire? Grasping related to desire refers to attachment that relishes desires, delights in pleasure, and becomes strongly attached. What is grasping that is related to views? Grasping related to views refers to everything from permanence and annihilation up to the sixty-two types of wrong views. What is grasping that is related to discipline? Grasping related to discipline refers to the disciplines, the observances, the austerities, the state of living a religious life, the ascetic qualities, and the strict abstinence taught by the noble ones, as well as the disciplines, the observances, the austerities, the state of living a religious life, the ascetic qualities, and the strict abstinence of the ninety-five nirgranthas. Grasping related to the view of a self refers to thinking, ‘The self, being, the life force, migrators, human beings, living creatures, agents, inducers of action, emerging, something that induces emergence, and the subject that feels, produces, and causes production arise and exist.’ Those are the four types of grasping. Bodhisattvas understand that those are inexpressible and therefore not real and unarisen. {{page:{number:128,id:UT22084-067-002-1323,folio:F.153.b}}} They understand that all phenomena have a single characteristic. That characteristic is understood as lacking any differentiation and as therefore insubstantial, inexpressible, beyond the realm of words, like the reflection of the moon in water, and like space, and the realm of phenomena is understood to lack any differentiation.
{{milestone:{label:6.35,id:UT22084-067-002-537}}}“When one delights in and relishes desires, one delights in suffering. That is the basis of desire, and that is clinging. When bodhisattvas see pleasing, beautiful, and attractive forms with their eyes, they understand them in the right way as being like a mass of fire before the eye consciousness. They understand that those aggregates that are not discerned by the eye consciousness are also immaterial, inexpressible, wordless, and not apprehended as real things. Since the eye consciousness is also not apprehended as a real thing, it is immaterial and without characteristics too. Since space, fire, and the eyes are also not apprehended as real things, they are inexpressible and wordless too. Thus, when they perceive an attractive form, up to having a desire for it, they do not apprehend the eye consciousness or the form or even the intervening space as a real thing. The eye consciousness that perceives fire arises and ceases, and is no longer present in the second moment. Feelings arise in the second moment, and bodhisattvas perceive them as masses of radiating light. Those feelings are inexpressible, beyond words, and free from marks. Feelings arise and cease and then perceptions arise as the basis of the next moment. These are perceived like the radiating light of a blazing tongue of flame. After those perceptions have arisen and ceased, formations arise as the basis of the second moment. Bodhisattvas perceive these as radiating lights that are either small or immeasurably large and either far or near. Then, once those formations have arisen and ceased, consciousness arises in the next moment. Bodhisattvas perceive that as a mass of radiating light that arises and disintegrates. {{page:{number:129,id:UT22084-067-002-1324,folio:F.154.a}}} This consciousness is inexpressible and a wordless state. It instantly disintegrates. It is like something imputed upon space. The space around the fire is also insubstantial, inexpressible, and wordless. All those masses of radiating light that they see arise, blaze forth, and cease have the characteristic of being just like space. They are inexpressible and insubstantial. They are innumerable, and each of their light rays is without conditions. Bodhisattvas should analyze the five sense pleasures that arise and cease in the same way that they analyze all of the phenomena that arise and cease—that they are like imputations in space, inexpressible, and insubstantial. They should cultivate the acceptance of this fact.”

{{milestone:{label:6.50,id:UT22084-067-002-553}}}“Thoughts that are based in all of these views of the mundane, supramundane, defiled, and undefiled are understood to have a basis that is endless due to momentariness, similar due to momentariness, and unrelated to anything real. Whatever is groundless is insubstantial and does not go anywhere. Whatever does not go anywhere is neither wholly afflicted nor purified. It does not originate and it does not begin. Whatever does not originate and does not begin is immaterial, does not appear, is devoid of thought, is without going, and is without coming. {{page:{number:131,id:UT22084-067-002-1326,folio:F.155.a}}} It is understood to be momentary in all three times. It is without activity, empty, and inexpressible. Since moments that are related to all three times are empty as a result of being completely momentary, and since anything about a view that is noble, ignoble, worldly, or supramundane—and all types of conceit related to views about nonconceptual thought, conceptual thought, conceptualization, causes, production, the body, and the vessel—are moments, then, noble son, views related to the three times are entirely empty. They are inexpressible and they are not something in which one should train or train perfectly. They are also not something in which one should not train.{{note:{index:98,id:UT22084-067-002-554}}} Discipline, learning, effort, joy, and laziness are not things in which one trains perfectly. The elimination of attachment is not insight, nor is it faulty insight. It is not a moral downfall. Wavering and the absence of moral downfall are neither things in which one trains perfectly nor things that are attained. Nothing is attained and there is no wavering. Worldly and supramundane views, thorough analysis,{{note:{index:99,id:UT22084-067-002-555}}} and wavering are not things in which one trains perfectly. That is not the way one should think about objects. The five sense pleasures, the form and formless realms, and the aggregates are also without adoption, and they do not have the characteristic marks of multiplicity.{{note:{index:100,id:UT22084-067-002-556}}} Wavering and the views related to the aggregates, the elements, and the sense fields are not things in which one perfectly trains. All views are nondual, empty, immaterial, and inexpressible.
{{milestone:{label:6.51,id:UT22084-067-002-557}}}“As an analogy, when someone’s face is reflected in a round mirror, the likeness of that face is not produced by the aggregates, by the elements, or by the sense fields. It is wordless and inexpressible. The same pertains to views that are noble, ignoble, worldly, and supramundane. None of them are produced by the aggregates, {{page:{number:132,id:UT22084-067-002-1327,folio:F.155.b}}} by the elements, or by the sense fields. All those views are inexpressible and wordless.

Similarly, noble son, anything that pertains to noble, ignoble, mundane, or supramundane views is inexpressible and wordless because it is conditioned by something established through delusion, along with grasping.” 
Then the Blessed One expressed these points in the following verses:

When someone is the least bit arrogant about or fixated on discipline, austerities, observances, and practicing a religious life, they engage in particular forms of penances, restrictions, and practices that bring harm to their bodies in order to destroy all the strong attachments to objects that lead to physical, verbal, and mental actions; {{page:{number:133,id:UT22084-067-002-1328,folio:F.156.a}}} to attain liberation from saṃsāra; and to transcend the three realms. This is grasping that is related to discipline. Noble son, when those who engage in doing harm to the body think, ‘Being affected by the three types of feeling is ignoble. It is pointless, false, and delusion,’ this is conceit about physical discipline. Why? Because the body is unwavering, unchanging, and not affected by any affliction. As an analogy, noble son, although the grains of sand in the Ganges are unwavering and unchanging, they roll down through the natural force of the river’s current. Similarly, although the body made of the four great elements is unwavering and unchanging, the condition of sudden contact is accompanied by grasping, and the body can be submitted to a variety of injuries, such as those practiced among highly advanced ascetics—beings belonging to the ninety-five nirgrantha orders and the like. When there is conceit about the physical, verbal, and mental formations of the three times, when one does not understand that they are the same thing as a likeness, and when one does not become tired of physical, verbal, and mental penances, this discipline is contaminated and conflicts with the acceptance of the suffering related to formations that are accompanied by grasping.
{{milestone:{label:6.61,id:UT22084-067-002-570}}}“Noble son, what is the cultivation of the acceptance of likeness and sameness? When one does not generate the three vows in the least, this is the cultivation of the acceptance of sameness and likeness. When one develops conceit about the perception of the three vows that is accompanied by grasping, it is contaminated and conflicts with the acceptance of suffering related to formations that are accompanied by grasping. When one understands that the three times have a single taste and are inseparable, that the generation of the three vows is unmoving, that there are no afflictions, and that formations are not purified, this is cultivating likeness and sameness. {{page:{number:134,id:UT22084-067-002-1329,folio:F.156.b}}} Apprehending the nondual objects of the six perfections as lasting and real, conceiving of wisdom in terms of increase, and becoming arrogant about the notion that the three times are truly established is defiled and conflicts with the acceptance of suffering related to formations that are accompanied by grasping. When pride occurs in regard to the nonduality of the six perfections; the fact that the three times are inseparable, unborn, and unceasing; and there being no discontinuation, no permanence, and no increase, this is the cultivation of the acceptance of likeness and sameness. 
{{milestone:{label:6.62,id:UT22084-067-002-572}}}“It is defilement when one abandons the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas and develops strong attachment to the good qualities one experiences through pursuing the Great Vehicle, and when one releases a rain of Dharma on beings who are proper vessels and beings who are not proper vessels upon meeting them, and when one thinks about penances and restrictions; apprehends a being, a life force, production, a soul, a person, an agent, and something that causes action in terms of causes and conditions; and dwells on and is arrogant about the fruition of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions. This destroys the acceptance of the suffering associated with formations related to grasping. When one does not think about the vows of the three times related to the vehicles of the hearers and the solitary buddhas, does not conceptualize them, does not cling to them, does not give them up, does not generate them, and does not discard those vows—and when one does not think about the vows of the three times related to the unsurpassed Great Vehicle, does not conceptualize them, does not cling to them, does not give them up, does not generate them, and does not discard them; when one does not apprehend them as the true essence of living a religious life; and when one does not apprehend them as having the characteristic of not developing conceit regarding the language related to all manner of formations—this is the perfection of the acceptance of the teaching that all phenomena that are alike and the same actually do not arise and are empty.

Even though the self lacks intrinsic nature, nevertheless, out of delusion, the proponents of a self produce a self among the five sense pleasures. From understanding the eye in terms of a self, engaging pleasant or unpleasant states of the eye consciousness, and developing a strong attachment toward what arises, up to understanding the mind in terms of a self, engaging pleasant or unpleasant states of the mental consciousness, {{page:{number:136,id:UT22084-067-002-1331,folio:F.157.b}}} and developing strong attachment toward what arises—one should consider all of this as false and delusional. Why? The truth of the six sense fields comes from their respective objects. Noble son, the eye and what conforms to it are not a self. Since there is no self and no ownership, what is conformable to the eye would be self-produced and would not change, if a self or an owner were to exist, so the eye is the self and the owner.{{note:{index:103,id:UT22084-067-002-585}}} That is how one should understand everything from the production of consciousness with respect to the eye that is the self, up to bodily contact. 
{{milestone:{label:6.74,id:UT22084-067-002-586}}}“However, forms are not produced by the eyes, the ear is not produced by sound either,{{note:{index:104,id:UT22084-067-002-587}}} and this is the case all the way up to tactile objects not being produced by the body. The body is not produced by touch, forms are not produced by the eyes, and forms, feelings, perceptions, and formations are not produced by the eyes. The eye consciousness is not produced by the eyes, and the eyes are not produced by the eye consciousness. The eyes do not perceive the objects of the ear, the ears do not perceive the object of the eyes, and this is the case up to the fact that the mind does not perceive the objects of mental phenomena and mental phenomena do not perceive the objects of mind. Since the essential nature of all of the six sense fields is that they are apprehended as the causes and conditions of the five sense pleasures and the five aggregates, the internal and external aggregates and the sense fields are all empty of a cause that can be conceived as being mutual. The five sense pleasures and the five aggregates are apprehended as the mutual causes and conditions of one another, but since they have the nature of conceptualization, they are mutually empty. The internal aggregates and sense fields do not have one and the same object either. Since they are neither internally nor externally existent, the internal and external aggregates and sense fields are not objects. In that way, all those inner and outer things are not objects for one another. Although they are apprehended in terms of being each other’s causes and conditions and are not conceptual objects, they reveal the mode of existence{{note:{index:105,id:UT22084-067-002-588}}} and the mode of illusion. The mode of illusion is {{page:{number:137,id:UT22084-067-002-1332,folio:F.158.a}}} anything that is not suchness. Whatever is not suchness is nonexistent, whatever is nonexistent is unborn, and whatever is unborn does not cease.
{{milestone:{label:6.75,id:UT22084-067-002-589}}}“Noble son, all phenomena lack birth and cessation. Nevertheless, there are foolish ordinary beings who practice austerities, and when they generate what lacks a self and then apprehend it as the cause and condition of nonvirtue they give rise to forms, stray away from liberation, and experience undesirable results in the lower realms for a long time. As an analogy, noble son, wood is not fire, wood does not possess fire, and wood is not mixed with fire. Nevertheless, when a person who wants fire rubs a piece of wood against another piece of wood with their two hands a fire will start and the wood will be consumed by fire. Similarly, noble son, all those external and internal things are empty of each other, and they are not each other’s objects. They are a likeness and lack a self. But even though they are empty, foolish ordinary beings who practice austerities become attached to these empty phenomena that lack a self, and when they congregate they produce the causes and conditions for improper conduct. Those causes and conditions lead them to experience undesirable results in the three lower realms and to circle in saṃsāra for a long time. However, those who understand that all external and internal phenomena have the nature of lacking a self and being empty perfect this acceptance through perfect conduct and they will quickly awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete awakening.”

The second moment that follows the arising and cessation of grasping gives rise to becoming. There are three types of existence: existence related to the desire realm, existence related to the form realm, and existence related to the formless realm. Existence related to the desire realm completely deceives beings. The eight great hell realms, the animal realms, the realms of the pretas, the four great continents, and the six abodes of the gods who live in the desire realm are referred to as the existence of the desire realm of the four-continent world.

{{milestone:{label:6.95,id:UT22084-067-002-618}}}“Furthermore, noble son, bodhisattvas should cultivate this acceptance in order to properly analyze the aggregate of perception. What is the aggregate of perception? The six groups of perceptions consist of perceptions generated through eye contact, ear contact, nose contact, tongue contact, body contact, and mind contact. Eye contact is contact that includes the following three things: the eye, consciousness, and generation of the perception of forms. All perceptions originate through the condition of contact that includes those three. It is said that the correct application of the emptiness of formations across the three times to visible forms is that they are not created, are devoid of aspects, and are like a mass of foam. One should not understand the eye consciousness in terms of conceit about it coming and going somewhere. One should understand that the three realms are without location and groundless and that they are everything from being empty of the eye consciousness up to being empty of the mental consciousness. When perceptions of the six sense fields arise, there is feeling. When there is feeling, there are concepts. When there are concepts, there is conceit. When there is conceit, there is grasping. When grasping arises, everything up to distress fully arises. Therefore, bodhisattvas should cultivate acceptance in order to properly analyze perception.

They completely understand cultivating that acceptance of the six groups of perception by cultivating the acceptance of everything up to mental perception, and that understanding has no concepts, no thoughts, and no approaching, grasping, manifestation, or attachment to things as real. They are not attached at all to the correct understanding that arises after cultivating the acceptance of the fact that all perceptions lack intrinsic nature and are completely annihilated. They understand that all perceptions related to the three realms and the three times are included in the realm of phenomena, which is groundless, baseless, without confusion, without disintegration, {{page:{number:145,id:UT22084-067-002-1340,folio:F.162.a}}} without adoption, without rejection, and without dualistic activity, and their understanding is completely indestructible. When one does not even apprehend the mind that does not grasp at any perceptions, this is referred to as cultivating acceptance related to the method of pure conduct. Cultivating acceptance of the fact that all perceptions are impermanent, suffering, and empty should be regarded as the bodhisattvas’ acceptance that ripens and looks after all beings.
{{milestone:{label:6.97,id:UT22084-067-002-620}}}“Noble son, bodhisattvas should also cultivate acceptance that completely understands formations. What are formations? There are three types of formations: bodily formations, verbal formations, and mental formations. Bodily formations are the movements of inhalation and exhalation. Verbal formations are concepts and discrimination. Mental formations are perceptions and volition. 
{{milestone:{label:6.98,id:UT22084-067-002-621}}}“Noble son, bodhisattvas should properly analyze the physical formations that are the movements of inhalation and exhalation. The entire body contains 92,000 or more than ninety-nine quintillion pores. Additionally, the entire body has openings the size of the most subtle particles numbering between 99,000 and 110,000. Since satiating a single pore of a flawless person is just like the movement of the breath through the 99,000 openings of all the pores of the entire body, it should be known as the entire movement of inhalation and exhalation called the breath moving through every pore. Bodhisattvas should cultivate acceptance in order to analyze the arising and destruction of the five aggregates related to the inhalation and exhalation through every opening.

Concepts and discriminations arise and cease in a single moment, and for any moment on any given day 6,500,000 people will momentarily arise.{{note:{index:114,id:UT22084-067-002-623}}} Concepts, discriminations, and all of the five aggregates that arise for a moment, arise and cease for each of them. {{page:{number:146,id:UT22084-067-002-1341,folio:F.162.b}}} Three types of feelings arise for each of the aggregates. Twelve limbs of origination arise for each feeling. Ninety-eight latent tendencies arise for each of those limbs of origination. Since all three realms arise for each of those latent tendencies, bodhisattvas should view conduct as the origin of the afflictions. These are the verbal formations.
{{milestone:{label:6.100,id:UT22084-067-002-624}}}“What are perceptions? Perceptions are the concepts, afflictions, and the afflictions caused by the marks associated with all the wrong views that are related to the movement of inhalation and exhalation.

More than one hundred that are the basis of anger manifest, more than one hundred that are the basis of delusion manifest, and more than one hundred afflictions related to particular types of behavior manifest. These, noble son, are physical, verbal, and mental volitions. Formations, examination, discrimination, and the movement of inhalation and exhalation are perceived by conceptual thought, and they are the foundation for the passing of thoughts and volitions with respect to perceptions.

The fact that the characteristics of phenomena are completely pure means that one does not find characteristics, does not apprehend them, and they do not arise in the realm of phenomena. They do not accumulate in ultimate reality. The end of formations is the same in that one does not find or apprehend an end of formations and they do not cease.

This end is the end of the infinite and endless, the end of what does not follow afterward, and the end of impermanence. Such an end is the end of the equality of the three times; it is the end of the nonduality of the three times, of going to the end, and of the body, speech, and mind.{{note:{index:117,id:UT22084-067-002-629}}} The end of all three times is the end of the nonduality in ultimate reality of the three formations. It is the end of nothing whatsoever. It is the end of the nonduality of the complete understanding of contact. It is the end of being free from disintegration. In the same way, it is the end of the understanding of the movement of inhalation and exhalation. It is likewise the end of the twenty views, the end of concepts and discrimination, which are like a tala tree with the top cut off.{{note:{index:118,id:UT22084-067-002-630}}} It is the end of volitions that end in a moment and volitions in regard to nonattachment to perceptions.

In this respect, perfect understanding is the end of all formations’ lack of foundation, and it is free from reverence for the three times. This is the complete understanding of ultimate reality known as completely understanding all phenomena. This eliminates the three types of formations that make one circle in saṃsāra.

Therefore, noble son, {{page:{number:148,id:UT22084-067-002-1343,folio:F.163.b}}} a bodhisattva should cultivate this acceptance that grasps the three times and the threefold formations as the acceptance by means of the method of perfect conduct for each being.

The torment that follows contact and feelings leads to destroying and completely abandoning acceptance in regard to the craving for objects. Fixating on the mental faculty leads to confusion and completely abandoning the acceptance in regard to the craving for the realm of perceptions. There is discord and one completely abandons the acceptance in regard to the craving for objects, which brings an end to the three times and the three types of formations. One holds fast to the marks of the three types of formations, completely abandons the acceptance related to craving for objects, and gets into arguments. Apprehending formations that have completely arisen, and completely abandoning the acceptance related to craving for objects, is the complete abandonment of any form of acceptance of the fact that there are no afflictions whatsoever in the realm of phenomena. Noble son, bodhisattvas cultivate the acceptance of the realm of phenomena devoid of afflictions and do not focus on the objects of the six collections of consciousness. This is the nature of cultivating acceptance, and it leads one to think about all objects as the coming together in the sphere of thought of entities that are like illusions.{{note:{index:122,id:UT22084-067-002-636}}}{{page:{number:149,id:UT22084-067-002-1344,folio:F.164.a}}}

When bodhisattvas have carried out a detailed analysis and the root of supreme virtue has completely arisen, they move throughout space and do not focus their attention on, or become conceited about, the three times or all manner of formations. In this way, their cultivation of acceptance of discipline will expand. One may practice the mental consciousness correctly on any path in which the three times and all of the formations have fully arisen. Suchness is insubstantial. Bodhisattvas understand that they should not engage with the three times and formations or cultivate any and all such phenomena. They know that they are free from cultivation and are without tone, without language, and wordless. They know that they do not arise, do not cease, and have no characteristics. They know that they are not the different vehicles, they are not apprehended, they are without marks, and they are not completely isolated. They know that they are inexpressible, without avarice, utterly peaceful, free from momentary apprehension, utterly extinguished, groundless, utterly tranquil, utterly devoid of object, utterly without beneficence, and completely rootless. They know that they are not the sense faculties, they are utterly impure, and they are completely separate, utterly without antidote, devoid of marks and insubstantial, not at all stolen, utterly diffuse, and utterly insubstantial with respect to all phenomena. On this understanding, there is no agent, no subject who feels, no hearing, and there is no apprehender. Individual appearances are like a mirage, like the moon’s reflection in water, and like a reflected image; they have the nature of space and are utterly nonexistent. {{page:{number:150,id:UT22084-067-002-1345,folio:F.164.b}}} All phenomena lack a self. This is the basis of their defining characteristic, the characteristic they have in common, their single characteristic, and bodhisattvas regard all things as grounded in the absence of a defining characteristic. They regard all phenomena, including all the formations and everything that is experienced in the three times, as grounded in suchness. Moreover, since the nourishment given by the bodhisattvas spreads to all beings, this should be regarded as the acceptance that tames beings with light that travels throughout space.

All those acceptances completely transcend the qualities of the hearers and solitary buddhas. All those acceptances perfect the qualities of bodhisattva conduct. All those acceptances gather all the qualities of the teachings of the buddhas. All those acceptances are understood along with the teachings for which other traditions argue.

{{milestone:{label:8.1,id:UT22084-067-002-678}}}The Blessed One then entered the invisible ornament absorption. After the Thus-Gone One entered that absorption, multicolored light radiated from the Blessed One’s mouth and illuminated buddha realms of the ten directions inundated with the five impurities as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges. As the hearers and beings who followed the vehicle of the hearers in those places were touched by that light, they experienced blissful feelings in their bodies. When the monks who did not experience such joy because they had entered the absorption of the third concentration level scanned the four directions, they saw that the blessed Śākyamuni was half a league away from them and saw all the ornaments that adorned Mount Gandhamādana just as they were described before. They saw Mount Gandhamādana in its natural state, in which it is made of the seven precious substances, and saw that it was filled with bodhisattvas. Through the power of the Blessed One, they departed for the place where the blessed Śākyamuni was residing and assembled before the Blessed One as soon as they were given the opportunity. The hearers and beings following the vehicle of the hearers also departed for the place where the blessed Śākyamuni was residing and assembled before Śākyamuni to listen to the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:8.2,id:UT22084-067-002-679}}}Some followers of the vehicle of the great hearers were holding their own assembly in the town of Kuru where they were dwelling in a state of repose.{{note:{index:134,id:UT22084-067-002-680}}} After they perceived that light and had been sated by the joy and happiness of being detached from material things, {{page:{number:158,id:UT22084-067-002-1353,folio:F.168.b}}} all of them awoke at the same time and saw the Blessed One residing at Mount Gandhamādana. They saw that he was surrounded and attended by assemblies of bodhisattvas and hearers, saw the great array, and understood perfectly. “Look, venerable monks,” they said, “right now the Thus-Gone One is residing on Mount Gandhamādana surrounded by a great array and those great assemblies. We should leave and go to where the Blessed One is residing so that we can listen to the Dharma!” All the great hearers of this Sahā buddha realm, as well as all the other hearers and followers of the vehicle of the hearers, then assembled before the Blessed One to listen to the Dharma. Immeasurable, countless, infinite hearers, and immeasurable, countless, infinite beings following the vehicle of the hearers, were assembled before the Blessed One to listen to the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:8.3,id:UT22084-067-002-681}}}The Blessed One then addressed Venerable Subhūti, saying, “Subhūti, this circumstance is known as ripening and complete ripening. Subhūti, to what extent is there complete ripening?”
{{milestone:{label:8.4,id:UT22084-067-002-682}}}Subhūti replied, “Blessed One, if your fully ripened characteristics were present, not a single being would enter nirvāṇa, since the Thus-Gone One’s fully ripened characteristics are a treasury as vast as space. Why not? It would frighten all of those beings and since they would be afraid, not a single one among them would give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Each one of the immeasurable characteristics of a thus-gone one and their fully ripened characteristics are without form and devoid of characteristics. All of their insubstantial bodies are free from characteristics. All of the qualities of the Buddha are like space, formless, and each of them is not established. Everything up to the qualities of a buddha is established in consciousness. The qualities of a buddha are fully ripened, since everything up to the fully ripened qualities of a buddha is not established in the mind element, and the eye element is not established in the qualities of a buddha. {{page:{number:159,id:UT22084-067-002-1354,folio:F.169.a}}} Since there is nothing established in the form element, tactile sensation is not established in anything up to the fully ripened qualities of a buddha. Since the earth element is not established in anything, and since wind is not established in anything up to the fully ripened qualities of a buddha, the realm of a buddha is fully ripened. Since the desire realm is not established in anything and the form realm is not established in anything, up to the fully ripened qualities of a buddha, the qualities of a buddha are fully ripened. The qualities of a buddha are fully ripened by not relying on self and other, on pride, on mental engagement, on permanence, or on annihilation. The qualities of a buddha are fully ripened by not relying on enumerative lists and marks. Why? Since the Blessed One lacks characteristics, all of the qualities that the Blessed One has mentioned are free from characteristics and are the domain of the mode of emptiness.”
{{milestone:{label:8.5,id:UT22084-067-002-683}}}The Blessed One then said, “Excellent Subhūti, excellent! Just as you have said, the accomplishment of the thus-gone ones’ ripening is without characteristics. Furthermore, there is clinging to the thus-gone one as a being, clinging to a life force, clinging to a soul, and clinging to a person. Furthermore, Subhūti, there are the characteristics related to clinging to the thus-gone one as a being up to the characteristics related to clinging to a person. But these are not the highly exalted state of the thus-gone ones, the hearers, and the solitary buddhas. They have gained mastery over wisdom. Subhūti, after a bodhisattva gives rise to the mind set on awakening for the first time, the bodhisattva expresses the conception of the characteristics of fully ripening the roots of virtue and the characteristics of detachment. Why? Because, Subhūti, they have a perception of the characteristics of a bodhisattva, and they have a perception that clings to elaborations about this. Due to that perception that clings to elaborations, there is a perception of pride and a perception of impermanence. They have the perception of wanting all beings to be happy, {{page:{number:160,id:UT22084-067-002-1355,folio:F.169.b}}} and the perception they have of wishing for happiness will not give rise to great love and great compassion. Subhūti, those bodhisattvas will not conceive of or think about great love and great compassion. By dedicating them to liberation, one is also free of not giving rise to roots of virtue.{{note:{index:135,id:UT22084-067-002-684}}} Therefore, Subhūti, one should proclaim that the roots of virtue are dedicated to liberation in a way that does not contradict the purity of the three fields and the six perfections.
{{milestone:{label:8.6,id:UT22084-067-002-685}}}“Just as there are no thoughts or concepts in space, bodhisattvas claim to have abandoned all thoughts and concepts. For example, Subhūti, the king of medicines called waxing moon cures all sicknesses and diseases, and it does so without thinking. It cures all our diseases without thinking about the one who has the illness. The medicine heals this body of ours without conceiving of or thinking about reciprocation and it pacifies all diseases. Subhūti, that is how even bodhisattvas at the lowest stage should practice the six perfections. When they cultivate all manner of generosity and insight, they do not conceive of or grasp at entities. As a result, they do not think about complete ripening. They do not rely upon or conduct themselves according to forms, and they do not rely upon or conduct themselves according to anything up to consciousness. Since they do not rely upon or conduct themselves according to forms, they do not rely upon and do not conduct themselves according to anything up to tactile sensations. They do not cling to names, and they do not cling to anything up to persons. They practice the six perfections knowing that the entirety of the three realms is without object, unstable, and lowly. When bodhisattvas have no thoughts and no concepts, they have an immeasurable amount of insight that is just like space. They will abandon the afflictions in all three realms and swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. {{page:{number:161,id:UT22084-067-002-1356,folio:F.170.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:8.7,id:UT22084-067-002-686}}}“Therefore, Subhūti, those who wish for the path of liberation should not do anything from practicing virtue based on the perception of a being up to practicing virtue based on the perception of a person. They should not practice virtue based on the perception of the aggregates, or the perception of the elements, or of the sense fields. They should not practice virtue based on the perception of possession and ownership. They should not practice virtue based on the perception of the desire realm, the perception of the form realm, or the perception of the formless realm. Why? Because, Subhūti, the characteristics of beings, space, liberation, and ripening are said to lack a self, and what is referred to as nirvāṇa is inseparably and completely empty.”
{{milestone:{label:8.8,id:UT22084-067-002-687}}}When the Blessed One had delivered this instruction, 92,000,000,000,000{{note:{index:136,id:UT22084-067-002-688}}} hearers and beings who follow the vehicle of the hearers gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening and each reached the level of nonregression.
{{milestone:{label:8.9,id:UT22084-067-002-689}}}The Blessed One then said to Venerable Subhūti, “Subhūti, all phenomena are understood to be just like the perception of conditions. Those who perceive worldly beings with the insight that arises based on the gathering of concordant conditions will transcend the ocean of existence and the mass of darkness will be cleared away just as new moons bring an end to dark lunar phases. Light is conditioned by the moon, perceptions are conditioned by light, formations are conditioned by perceptions, and consciousnesses are conditioned by formations. At that point a mass of suffering has arisen. Space is not understood to be light. Space is not light. Perceptions are not perceived in the absence of light. Perception is not understood to be light. When light ceases, perceptions cease. When perceptions cease, formations cease, and at that point the great mass of suffering will also cease.”
{{milestone:{label:8.10,id:UT22084-067-002-690}}}At that moment when the Blessed One had delivered these instructions, {{page:{number:162,id:UT22084-067-002-1357,folio:F.170.b}}} eight trillion beings following the vehicle of the hearers gave rise to the mind set on the vehicle of the solitary buddhas. They attained the free from dust absorption and reached the level of not regressing from the vehicle of the solitary buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:8.11,id:UT22084-067-002-691}}}The Blessed One then asked Venerable Subhūti, “Subhūti, when one speaks of ‘the Dharma of mendicants,’ what is the meaning of those words?”
Subhūti replied, “Blessed One, the Dharma of mendicants refers to the three trainings. Blessed One, that is the Dharma of mendicants.”
{{milestone:{label:8.12,id:UT22084-067-002-693}}}The Blessed One continued, “Thus it is, Subhūti! The trainings of higher discipline, mind, and insight are referred to as the Dharma of mendicants. What is the training of higher discipline? Being bound by a mendicant’s vows of individual liberation, excelling in the domain of conduct,{{note:{index:137,id:UT22084-067-002-694}}} fearing the slightest wrongdoing, and training in the correct conduct—these terms for training, Subhūti, are known as the training in higher discipline. The training of higher mind consists of everything from abiding in the four abodes of Brahmā up to having a loving intention that satiates the entire world. The extensive explanations on this are known as the training of higher mind.{{note:{index:138,id:UT22084-067-002-695}}} What is the training of higher insight? This refers to the four noble truths. What are those four truths? They are the noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. What is the noble truth of suffering? It is the suffering of birth, the suffering of old age, the suffering of sickness, the suffering of death, the suffering of encountering something one dislikes, the suffering of being separated from what one does like, and the suffering of not getting what one wants. In short, it is the suffering associated with the aggregates that are the basis of grasping. This is referred to as the truth of suffering. {{page:{number:163,id:UT22084-067-002-1358,folio:F.171.a}}} What is the origin of suffering? Those who possess strong desire will experience those different types of suffering. What is the cessation of suffering? It is said to be the abandonment of each and every manifestation of strong desire, the absence of origination, the absence of destruction, the freedom from desires, and complete peace. What is the noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering? This refers to the branches of the noble path: correct view, correct thought, correct speech, correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness, and correct absorption. Those are known as the eight true topics. 
{{milestone:{label:8.13,id:UT22084-067-002-696}}}“In the recent past, the thus-gone ones, the worthy, perfect buddhas, have explained that these four noble truths are such that they are the correct offering for the hearers and as the correct offering, too, of the Thus-Gone One. For that reason, some of the thus-gone ones, the worthy, perfect buddhas who currently reside in, thrive in, and care for the immeasurable, countless buddha realms of the ten directions also explain this Dharma to beings living in buddha realms inundated with the five impurities. The four noble truths that those thus-gone ones explain as a Dharma that is the correct offering for hearers takes the same form. As in the recent past, the thus-gone ones, the worthy, perfect buddhas, will also explain the four noble truths as the correct offering for hearers and the Dharma of the thus-gone ones, the worthy, perfect buddhas, in the future. The teachings of all the thus-gone ones, the worthy, perfect buddhas of the past, present, and future, are words of truth.” {{page:{number:164,id:UT22084-067-002-1359,folio:F.171.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:8.14,id:UT22084-067-002-697}}}As the Blessed One delivered this instruction on the higher training of insight, including the four noble truths, countless and immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of beings following the vehicle of the hearers reached the level of not arising. Some understood the summit, some understood acceptance, and some understood the highest worldly dharmas. Some attained the fruition of the stream enterers, some attained the fruition of the once-returners, some attained the fruition of the non-returners, and some attained the fruition of the worthy ones who are free from all afflictions.

{{milestone:{label:9.1,id:UT22084-067-002-699}}}Then the Blessed One entered the absorption known as the absorption of complete discernment, and from within that absorption a multitude of multicolored light rays displaying hundreds of thousands of colors radiated from every pore of the Blessed One’s body. The Blessed One then looked at those beings dressed like seers who were engaging in all kinds of unwholesome austerities and observances. His radiating light illuminated buddha realms of the ten directions inundated with the five impurities that were as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges. The members of other non-Buddhist sects in those buddha realms inundated with the five impurities that were as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges, who were engaging in unwholesome austerities and observances, faithfully followed brahmins, so the Buddha manifested himself as a brahmin. With faith in that brahmin, those beings said, “Since we trust this teacher as a brahmin, let us look to this brahmin!”
{{milestone:{label:9.2,id:UT22084-067-002-700}}}Filled with joy and delight, they quickly stood up, prostrated at the brahmin’s feet, and bowed to the brahmin with their palms together as they said, “After a very long time, our assembly has been drawn to become your disciples so that we might look upon, pay homage to, and serve the Blessed One.” {{page:{number:165,id:UT22084-067-002-1360,folio:F.172.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:9.3,id:UT22084-067-002-701}}}The emanated brahmin replied, “There is a great brahmā, superior to me, who is my master,” and he gestured with his hand to show the direction. “He is the blessed Śākyamuni, and he resides not far from here.”{{note:{index:139,id:UT22084-067-002-702}}}
{{milestone:{label:9.4,id:UT22084-067-002-703}}}Through the power of the Blessed One, those beings saw the great brahmin—the blessed Śākyamuni—who was residing on Mount Gandhamādana about half a league away from them. Filled with intense joy and delight, they instantly arrived at Mount Gandhamādana, prostrated at the feet of the great brahmin Śākyamuni, and sat before the Blessed One to listen to the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:9.5,id:UT22084-067-002-704}}}As everyone was gathering—from those who had faith in Īśvara, to those who had faith in Śakra, those who had faith in the Four Great Kings, those who had faith in the Sun and Moon, those who had faith in the Dark One and Youthful Mahākāla, and those who had faith in Agni—a mass of radiating light appeared before them. A god with a white body and white clothes, who was handsome, had a superior complexion, and was in the full bloom of his youth, appeared out of the mass of radiating light. The god of fire declared, “You are definitely my disciples!”
“That is correct, Blessed One!” they replied.
{{milestone:{label:9.6,id:UT22084-067-002-706}}}The god then said, “There is another lord of fire who acts as my master,” and he pointed his arm to show the direction.
{{milestone:{label:9.7,id:UT22084-067-002-707}}}Through the power of the Blessed One, those beings also saw the blessed Śākyamuni, who was residing not far away from them—about half a league away—on Mount Gandhamādana. Everyone from that great bonfire took their place before that handsome and attractive deity who had appeared out of the great ball of fire with a white body, clothes, and hair, and who had a supreme complexion and was in the full bloom of his youth. At that point, immeasurable, countless non-Buddhists who were engaged in improper practices and observances, as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges, had taken their places before the Blessed One to listen to the Dharma. Those beings who had faith in brahmins saw the Blessed One in the form of a brahmin. {{page:{number:166,id:UT22084-067-002-1361,folio:F.172.b}}} The thought occurred to them, “We should converse with that great brahmin! We should ask that blessed great brahmin about our doubts and hesitations. How is it that everyone in this entire assembly has faith in that great brahmin? Look at everyone, from those beings who practice the fire observance up to that handsome and attractive god who has manifested from that great fireball with a white body, hair, and clothes, a perfect complexion, and who is in the full bloom of his youth!” Then they wondered, “How could everyone in this entire assembly have become practitioners of the fire observance?”
{{milestone:{label:9.8,id:UT22084-067-002-708}}}Then, Immaculately Clothed Youth spoke to the entire assembly with a melodious voice, saying, “Good people, all you great brahmins who have come here, please listen! The great seer Śākyamuni, the thus-gone one, the worthy, perfect buddha, is learned and venerable. He is the well-gone one, the unsurpassed knower of the world, the trainer who tames beings, the teacher of both gods and humans, the blessed buddha for whom one longs. He surpasses all beings and all qualities. He is the father of the bodhisattvas and the teacher of all who practice austerities and observances, and who lead the religious life. He has completely eliminated all defilements, he is the king of noble people, he does not think of himself before all beings,{{note:{index:140,id:UT22084-067-002-709}}} he is the captain who leads beings to nirvāṇa, and he knows all the buddhas of the three times. He knows the wishes of all beings with his immeasurable wisdom that is a storehouse of merit and a path to merit. His immeasurable eloquence clears away the darkness of ignorance in its entirety. His roar and melodious voice are completely pure, he is adorned with patience, he has the characteristic of a flower, and his body is ornamented by the excellent minor marks. He displays a form that cannot turn away beings and he teaches the various classes of beings. {{page:{number:167,id:UT22084-067-002-1362,folio:F.173.a}}} He brings joy to beings of all forms.{{note:{index:141,id:UT22084-067-002-710}}} He delights those who are inclined toward virtue. He does not oppose insight, and he dries up all the destinies of cyclic existence. He does not pay fidelity to any of the fields of learning.{{note:{index:142,id:UT22084-067-002-711}}} His body is unequaled. He is not veiled by desire, nor is he veiled by forms, by marks, or by characteristics. He transcends the formless realm, he is free from all forms of suffering, he has given up the bonds, and he has reversed the course of all death and rebirth. He is a physician to all beings, causing them to cast off suffering, and he is liberated from the aggregates of the three times. He has extinguished the sense fields and craving, and he does not have attachment. He has crossed over the four rivers, his wisdom is insatiable, and he abides in ultimate reality. Since he has accomplished knowledge, he has achieved complete understanding. He is generous, he is endowed with great compassion, he establishes beings on the path leading to nirvāṇa, and he completely transcends the domain of the four māras.

It is difficult to find an assembly like this that is intent upon the Dharma, it is difficult to find a place of retreat like this where one can observe virtuous companions, and it is difficult to find beings like this who listen to and focus on the Dharma. Now that you have obtained those circumstances, listen to this Dharma teaching that has never been heard before!

What sacred Dharma will lead these beings to liberation at the seat of awakening? Can any method lead them to the other shore of extinction? Does matted hair cause beings to be liberated? Do bones, smearing with dung, or making one’s bed in ashes lead to complete liberation? Do the practices that rely on Śakra, Brahmā, the Moon, the Sun, or Agni lead to liberation at the seat of awakening? Can any type of fear lead them to the other shore of extinction?”
{{milestone:{label:9.12,id:UT22084-067-002-716}}}Youthful Immaculately Clothed Youth replied, “Respected Blessed One, beings who adhere to wrong views will not reach the seat of awakening. When they analyze the process of death, birth, and existence they will not overcome the fetters of existence. Due to the two extremes, those beings will completely corrupt this acceptance of taming beings with the perfect method of conduct and light rays that travel through space. Those who strive for a lowly human birth because their nature is to pursue their desires and pleasures, and those who inflict harm upon themselves through the pointless, ignoble, and inferior practices and observances of the ninety-five nirgranthas, these two types of people are led to ruin because they lack acceptance. {{page:{number:169,id:UT22084-067-002-1364,folio:F.174.a}}} They give rise to a great mass of afflictions.

From that point until the blessed Thus-Gone One wandered and went to another land, I went begging for alms in another town where a great sacrifice was taking place. There, great compassion arose in me toward those who wanted to kill living beings.

“At that time, I went to the wilderness. I sat on the ground and reflected about the aspirations I might make. Then the Thus-Gone One Lord of the Brahmā Realm instructed me to make those aspirations in a dream, so I made them before that thus-gone one. I developed compassion for beings and I realized the defects of saṃsāra.

“No, I did not.”

“Respected Blessed One, it was the power of those extraordinary aspirations.”

Your aspirations will liberate beings from all manner of paths to wrong views, and no other power can liberate beings from all manner of paths to wrong views. Noble son, to whose aggregates of form up to consciousness in the three times is this prophecy of awakening related? To whose six sense fields associated with feelings of the three times, which are pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant, is it related? To whose absence of feeling is it related? Whose prophecy of awakening is this?”

Just as space is immaterial, insubstantial, without intrinsic nature, utterly nonexistent, wordless, without attainment, and inexpressible, those phenomena are also everything from immaterial and insubstantial to inexpressible and unborn. Respected Blessed One, everything from form to consciousness does not arise across the three times. They are free from visible characteristics and are unborn. Respected Blessed One, everything from the eyes to the internal mental faculty of the three times does not arise and is free from visible characteristics. Feelings that are pleasant, unpleasant, and neither pleasant nor unpleasant are everything from unborn to free from visible characteristics. Respected Blessed One, I do not apprehend an ultimate nature of forms related to the three times, or arising, abiding, and disintegrating in the nature of reality. I do not apprehend anything that dwells in the realm of phenomena. I do not see name and form. I cannot see the characteristics of form, which are mere labels. The same goes for feelings, perceptions, and formations. Respected Blessed One, I do not see the characteristics of consciousness, which are mere labels, in the ultimate reality of the consciousnesses of the three times. Blessed One, I do not see the ultimate reality of the eye related to the three times; the characteristics of the eye, which are mere verbal designations; the collection of the internal mental faculty related to the three times; or contact that is pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Respected Blessed One, I do not apprehend arising, abiding, and disintegrating as being related to ultimate reality, the true nature of phenomena, or the faultlessness of phenomena. I do not apprehend the elements related to mind and mental phenomena. {{page:{number:223,id:UT22084-067-002-1418,folio:F.201.a}}} I do not see the abiding characteristics of the mind. Why? Because all phenomena are like echoes. Like characteristics superimposed on space, they are without coming and going, and they are not apprehended in any way. All phenomena are like optical illusions, mirages, dreams, and reflections of the moon in water. Like characteristics superimposed upon space, they do not come and go, and they cannot be apprehended anywhere in any way.

Listen, my friends!

{{milestone:{label:12.2,id:UT22084-067-002-927}}}As the Blessed One uttered those melodious words throughout the ten directions in a single statement, they transformed into 84,000 different languages and tones. Through the expression of those languages and dialects, all beings understood that statement in their own words. Those melodious words spread throughout the empty buddha realms of the ten directions inundated with the five impurities that were as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges. They even resounded in the ears of the beings that had been born in the lower realms in those empty buddha realms of the ten directions inundated with the five impurities that were as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges. Those beings understood this statement in their own words, and thought, “Who is this most sublime being who teaches us the path of peace and happiness with such beautiful, pleasant, and delightful words? The path that he has taught will lead to unsurpassed and perfect awakening.

Through this path of virtuous actions, you will become the most sacred and eminent of all beings. You will develop great love, great compassion, and the great wisdom of an omniscient one. You will feel affection toward all beings and work for their benefit. What is this path of the ten virtuous actions? Beings who follow the path of virtuous actions will quickly attain everything from rebirth among gods and humans to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. My friends, after being born among god and humans, you should exert yourselves in the path of virtuous actions. You should practice generosity, maintain discipline, and cultivate the ten perceptions. What are those ten perceptions? You should cultivate the perception of a decomposing corpse. That will lead to everything from the result of a stream enterer to the result of a worthy one, and all your suffering will be extinguished. You should also cultivate the perception of a putrefying corpse, the perception of a bluish corpse, the perception of a bloody corpse, the perception of a corpse covered by maggots, the perception of a devoured corpse, the perception of a scattered corpse, the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a burned corpse, and the perception of someone dying. Through those perceptions, you will attain everything from the fruition of the stream enterers to the fruition of the worthy ones, and all your sufferings will be extinguished.

He used that absorption to send forth emanations to all of the realms empty of a buddha, where beings are inundated with afflictions, that there are throughout the ten directions and which are as numerous as all of the grains of sand in the Ganges. He stood in the form of Brahmā before each of those beings who were devoted to Brahmā, and taught the Dharma. He led some of them to adopt the path of unsurpassed and perfect awakening and established them on it. He established other beings in the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, and others in the vehicle of the hearers. Some of them practiced the path of virtuous actions so that they would be born among gods and humans. He taught the Dharma in front of those who were devoted to Īśvara and to elephants, horses, pretas, and hell beings while assuming the physical appearances of Īśvara, an elephant, a horse, a preta, and a hell being. {{page:{number:228,id:UT22084-067-002-1423,folio:F.203.b}}} Some of those hell beings were led to direct their thoughts toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening and some practiced the path leading to rebirth among gods and humans.

Some of them reached the level of nonregression, and some attained acceptances, absorptions, and dhāraṇīs. Through the strength and the miraculous power stemming from the attainment of those acceptances, absorptions, and dhāraṇīs, they arrived in front of the Thus-Gone One Śākyamuni in this Sahā buddha realm. Among the myriads of beings as numerous as all the grains of sand in countless Ganges Rivers who had given rise to the mind set on the vehicle for which they had set forth the conditions and had created roots of virtue, some departed to other buddha realms in which blessed buddhas resided, thrived, offered sustenance, and taught the Dharma to beings. Others abided on the level of nonregression. Similarly, through the power of their aspirations, myriads of beings as numerous as all the grains of sand in immeasurable, countless Ganges Rivers who had given rise to the mind set on the vehicle of the hearers and created roots of virtue; beings in buddha realms as numerous as all the grains of sand in immeasurable, countless Ganges Rivers who abided on the path of the ten virtuous actions and had been born among gods and humans; and myriads of other beings as numerous as all the grains of sand in countless Ganges Rivers who lived in the different buddha realms were reborn in this buddha realm of the Thus-Gone One Śākyamuni after they died. {{page:{number:229,id:UT22084-067-002-1424,folio:F.204.a}}} Through the power of their aspirations, some beings were reborn in other pure buddha realms where blessed buddhas resided, offered sustenance, and taught the Dharma while being surrounded by multitudes of bodhisattvas.

{{milestone:{label:12.16,id:UT22084-067-002-948}}}“Due to the defects of those kings, some bodhisattvas will go to other worlds. Some bodhisattvas will maintain their ascetic virtues, contentment, and impartiality in remote places and forests. The deities who protect those lands will become displeased and disregard the welfare and needs of those lands. In those lands, the assemblies will engage in mutual conflicts. Due to the faults of those kings, beings will contract many diseases. They will be separated from the accumulations, their ability to recollect will be impaired, they will pursue that which opposes the Dharma, they will quickly become old and decrepit, and they will quickly die. To whom should this Dharma teaching be entrusted for the future during the final five hundred years when there will be such conflict? 
{{milestone:{label:12.17,id:UT22084-067-002-949}}}“In the future, during the final five hundred years, there will be kings who are not worthy of adoration, whose insight is confused, who are rough and greedy, who enjoy wealth but not the Dharma, who have no need for faith in words, who are thoughtless, who solicit payment, who are great liars, and who plot to deceive others. They will not venerate and look after the mendicants, brahmins, householders, and scholars who seek the Dharma, or Dharma reciters. Instead, they will enjoy lying about them and abusing them. When they hear words that are not the Dharma, they will think about putting them into practice. They will support with heaps of wealth the kings and royal priests who have little merit or insight, who observe unwholesome discipline, who solicit payment, who are rough, who praise themselves, {{page:{number:232,id:UT22084-067-002-1427,folio:F.205.b}}} who criticize others, who adhere to inappropriate views, who think about immediate necessities without restraining their bodies and speech, who do not think about upholding the Dharma, who delight in negative actions, and who do not venerate those mendicants, brahmins, and householders. Through the power of wealth and lies, they will worship and serve royal priests who should not be venerated. They will listen to and act upon the words of royal priests who should not be venerated, they will worship them, and those priests will be worshiped and become an object of worship for those kings. Due to the faults of those who should not be venerated, the tenets of the Dharma will be obliterated, and the tenets of false Dharma will rise. If the bodhisattva great beings are going to dwell in states of indifference and practice concentration, to whom should I entrust this Dharma teaching?
{{milestone:{label:12.18,id:UT22084-067-002-950}}}“In the future, during the final five hundred years when the sacred Dharma will be no more than a reflection of itself, there will be people who renounce householder life and who strive for their own interests, lack faith, and observe unwholesome discipline; whose insight is confused; and who are stingy about the Dharma as they crave houses, status, domains, land, and profit. They will harbor ill will toward each other, and they will look for opportunities to deceive others. They will delight in receiving gifts and being venerated by others. They will denigrate monks who have reached sublime levels of realization, and they will be deceitful about others’ dwelling places, cities, preceptors, and teachers. They will interrupt the peace and happiness that comes from contemplation and the discernment of yogic practice. They will crave food and drinks, they will strive for profit and honor, and they will worship householders. Since they will denigrate those who seek the Dharma, {{page:{number:233,id:UT22084-067-002-1428,folio:F.206.a}}} the Dharma reciters will abandon the monasteries. They will become hermits and settle into states of concentration upon indifference in their beds. At that time, when the tenets of false Dharma are thriving, some bodhisattva great beings will leave for other worlds, and some others will dwell in remote areas in a state of indifference. The deities who protect those lands will also dwell in states of indifference, and those lands will experience famines, diseases, and conflict. Beings in those places will bind and kill each other, and they will take refuge in mistaken views out of fear of each other. So, to whom should I entrust an acceptance of the way of all profound teachings such as this one?”
{{milestone:{label:12.19,id:UT22084-067-002-951}}}The entire assembly of bodhisattvas, great hearers, and powerful gods, gandharvas, and asuras exclaimed, “Blessed One, please entrust this acceptance of the way of the profound Dharma to our hands! We will spread out and prevent fights, disputes, famines, droughts, diseases, and assemblies of non-Buddhists in any royal palaces and lands where this acceptance of the way of the profound Dharma is practiced! We shall protect those people who recite the Dharma, who seek the Dharma, and who establish the Dharma! We shall convert the kings, ministers, royal attendants, and all those who live in towns and in the countryside into followers of the Dharma!”
{{milestone:{label:12.20,id:UT22084-067-002-952}}}The Blessed One replied, “Respectable ones, this is excellent, excellent! Your eloquence and diligence are excellent, and you are fearless. Even if you are tormented by beings who display nasty aggression, by beings who are extremely abusive, or by hunger and thirst; even if you are beaten up with sticks; and even if you are tormented by cold, by heat, or by wind, until you attain the state of the sublime Dharma eye, in all the lands, cities, towns, country villages, and buddha realms, who among you will enthusiastically strive for this Dharma eye? {{page:{number:234,id:UT22084-067-002-1429,folio:F.206.b}}} Who among you will reveal this acceptance that is the foundation of the gateway to all the profound Dharma teachings, convert beings to this acceptance, spread out among all those who cultivate it, read it aloud, impart the textual transmission to others, encourage others read it, encourage everyone to listen to it, write it down, make others write it down, and spread out to protect, guard, and provide shelter for those who follow the Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:12.21,id:UT22084-067-002-953}}}At that moment, the ten thousand bodhisattvas led by Maitreya stood up, prostrated with their palms joined in the direction of the Blessed One, and exclaimed, “Respected Blessed One, we will convert all of the beings in every buddha realm until they are patrons of the holy Dharma. We will spread out to convert them into followers of the Dharma so that they commission this Dharma teaching to be written down in a book!”
{{milestone:{label:12.22,id:UT22084-067-002-954}}}The Blessed One said, “Noble sons, you perform the activities of great beings, and you have attained this acceptance of taming beings through the sky-colored method of perfect conduct. This is excellent, excellent! Noble sons, as you diligently maintain the power and endeavor of this acceptance, your diligent maintenance of that power and endeavor will ripen beings in all the buddha realms, all the four-continent worlds, all the lands, all the villages, all the cities, all the towns, and all the provinces. Do not deceive kings, and do not abandon ministers and royal attendants. Noble sons, from today until the banner of the Dharma is unfurled in the buddha realms inundated with the five impurities, spread out to ripen beings without becoming weary. Introduce those beings who seek out misdeeds and adhere to wrong views to the path of virtuous actions and place them on it. Encourage beings with numerous faults to becoming renunciants and embrace peace, {{page:{number:235,id:UT22084-067-002-1430,folio:F.207.a}}} and establish them in the fundamental precepts. Prepare beings who are afflicted with many faults but whose bodies, speech, and minds are ready for training in the concentrations, liberations, dhāraṇīs, and acceptances. Encourage beings to delight in making their bed in solitary places as hermits and encourage them to benefit others. Do everything from converting stingy beings to the practice of generosity, to converting those with confused insight who are involved with evil domains and adhere to dense views to the power of noble insight, and establish them in each one. 
{{milestone:{label:12.23,id:UT22084-067-002-955}}}“Bodhisattvas who liberate these beings overwhelmed by various forms of suffering increase their mass of merit many times over. Bodhisattvas who demonstrate acceptance in the face of weariness for seven days and nights in order to ripen beings, ripen beings through the power of this acceptance, and lead beings in afflicted realms inundated with the five impurities to adopt a small amount of this acceptance during the time when the sacred Dharma is in decline, and who teach it to beings and have them recite it and write it in a book, increase their merit many times over. The countless bodhisattvas as numerous as all the grains of sand in ten Ganges Rivers who practice the six perfections in pure buddha fields do not increase their heap of merit to that extent. Why? Because those bodhisattvas are naturally endowed with great compassion. Those great beings are striving for a great goal, and they are adorned with great diligence and insight. Those bodhisattva great beings will quickly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. The power they generate in relation to the acceptance that tames beings with the sky-colored method of perfect conduct does everything from ripening beings in afflicted buddha realms inundated with the five impurities to getting them to commission it to be written in a book. Since they will light the lamp of the Dharma when the Dharma is in decline, {{page:{number:236,id:UT22084-067-002-1431,folio:F.207.b}}} they will be known as bodhisattvas endowed with great compassion, and they will quickly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.”
{{milestone:{label:12.24,id:UT22084-067-002-956}}}When the Blessed One had praised the conduct of the bodhisattvas in the afflicted buddha realms, bodhisattva great beings as numerous as all the grains of sand in the Ganges prostrated to the blessed Śākyamuni with their palms together and said, “Respected Blessed One, we have undertaken the practice of bodhisattva conduct while dwelling in countless pure buddha realms. We had forsaken all those beings in afflicted buddha realms inundated with the five impurities who are disconnected from roots of virtue, and taken the vow to reside in pure buddha realms from that day until the end of time. Today, we take the following vow before the Blessed One: We shall not practice bodhisattva conduct in pure buddha realms anymore until the end of time! Through the power of our aspirations, we shall practice that conduct in impure and afflicted buddha realms inundated with the five impurities, and we shall ripen all those beings who lack roots of virtue!”
{{milestone:{label:12.25,id:UT22084-067-002-957}}}“Holy beings,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattvas who focus their attention on great diligence and ripen all the beings who are disconnected from roots of virtue are excellent, excellent!

The kings will be healthy; they will live a long life while experiencing little harm; they will be pure and have no opponents or enemies; and their strength and skills will be unimpeded, they will experience a lot of joy, and they will wish for the Dharma. Why? Because those lands will be protected by nāgas, Śakra, Brahmā, the world protectors, and the lords of the yakṣas, and those respectable ones are unequaled!”
{{milestone:{label:12.27,id:UT22084-067-002-960}}}Śakra, Brahmā, the world protectors, and the lords of the yakṣas then exclaimed in unison, “That is correct, Blessed One!

What are those four? In those lands, the royal attendants and ministers will be perfectly patient, gentle, joyful, and respectful; their kings will be loving; the mendicants, the brahmins, the people living in towns and in the countryside, the women, the boys, and the girls will be pleasant and joyful, and they will not seek the Dharma for material gain; and their fame and praises will spread far and wide throughout the ten directions and they will live long lives, experiencing a lot of happiness and pleasures.
