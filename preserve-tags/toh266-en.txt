{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-067-005-33}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagṛha, at Vulture Peak Mountain, together with a large monastic assembly of one thousand two hundred and fifty monks, when Venerable Śāriputra rose from his seat, draped his robe over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Bowing to the Blessed One with palms joined, he asked, “Blessed One, how many blessed buddhas are there now, dwelling alive and well and teaching the Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-067-005-35}}}The Blessed One replied to Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, listen well and pay attention as I explain!”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-067-005-36}}}“Excellent, Blessed One!” said Venerable Śāriputra, and he listened to the Blessed One: 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-067-005-37}}}“Śāriputra, a trillion world systems beyond this buddhafield to the east, in a world system that is a buddhafield called Illuminated, dwells the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the completely perfect buddha called Source of Jewels. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-067-005-38}}}“Śāriputra, all those who hear the name of the thus-gone one Source of Jewels and give rise to faith will obtain the seven precious factors of perfect awakening and will progress irreversibly toward unexcelled, perfect and complete awakening. In sixty eons they will turn away from saṃsāra.

Śāriputra, the heap of merit generated by completely filling the trigalactic megagalactic world system with the seven kinds of precious substances and offering it every day to the blessed buddhas for as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River does not approach even a hundredth part of the heap of merit generated by hearing the name of the thus-gone one Sublime Jewel, giving rise to faith, and joining palms. Neither does it permit of any calculation, reckoning in fractions, analogy, or comparison.

{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-067-005-49}}}“Now, Śāriputra, when I taught on proclaiming the name of the thus-gone one Akṣobhya and his virtues, the evil Māra heard about it. Assembling all his troops he came before me and said, ‘To proclaim the names of the thousand blessed buddhas will be impossible,{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-067-005-51}}} but that’s not the case for the thus-gone one Akṣobhya’s name.

The proclaiming of the name and virtues of that blessed one in this world system, Blessed One, sickens{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-067-005-56}}} and torments me. But in order to create obstacles for those listening to that name, I am taking up arms. Why? So that those who hear the name of that thus-gone one will fall under my control.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-067-005-58}}}“Then the Blessed One said to the evil Māra, ‘Evil one, do not take up arms. You cannot create obstacles for those sublime persons. Why is that? Because I have entrusted them to the thus-gone one Akṣobhya, and to other thus-gone ones as well, so the thus-gone one Akṣobhya will care for them and bless them.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-067-005-60}}}Then, Venerable Śāriputra said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, when the evil Māra previously came before the Thus-Gone One, and with those words you sounded the lion’s roar, who were the people hearing the name of the thus-gone one Akṣobhya, to create obstacles for whom and bring them under his control the evil Māra then took up arms?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-067-005-62}}}The Blessed One replied to Venerable Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, it is like this: I saw that there are beings who have heard about proclaiming the thus-gone one Akṣobhya and his virtues, but presently have given up doing so and cling rigidly to a teaching that will lead them to the hells.”
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-067-005-64}}}Śāriputra replied, “Blessed One, please explain well: how many beings have given it up?”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-067-005-66}}}The Blessed One replied, “Śāriputra, throughout the ten directions the name of that thus-gone one will be heard, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-067-005-767,folio:F.290.a}}} and in other world systems when the thus-gone ones accordingly teach the Dharma beginning with his virtues, beings’ wisdom increases and expands, such that even when taught about his virtues in full they will never be satiated. Śāriputra, that those who directly perceive that thus-gone one would give up proclaiming his virtues is impossible and will not happen. 
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-067-005-68}}}“For those blessed buddhas to appear in the degenerate age of afflictions is impossible. It is like this: as a comparison, during this present age of the five degenerations in which I have appeared, even the beings here in this Sahā world system who have such{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-067-005-69}}} weak intelligence can comprehend the virtues that I am explaining, and so it goes without saying that those beings who are dwelling in the thousand-fold world system of Akṣobhya can do so. Śāriputra, that being the case, this Dharma discourse extolling those virtues will gradually spread in the different directions,{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-067-005-844}}} where all the sublime beings who have embarked on the Great Vehicle will propagate it. 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-067-005-70}}}“But now, Śāriputra, listen to how those who are not sublime beings will listen to this Dharma discourse and, having heard it, will forsake it!”

Having forsaken it, those sons of noble family will go{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-067-005-73}}} to a place where there is no end to torment. All those who gather en masse to severely disparage this sūtra will go there. There will be eighty million and five hundred thousand beings who will forsake this sūtra in the north.

Śāriputra, these qualities correspond only to themselves, for buddhas are inconceivable. The qualities of buddhas are also inconceivable, for the qualities of buddhas are known only by those possessing the actual nature of buddhas. One cannot know them, and one should not forsake them without knowing them. To forsake just a four-line verse of a sūtra like this is to incur a mass of demerit to the same extent as was mentioned earlier.

They will become as firm as the body of Nārāyaṇa and they will make irreversible progress toward unexcelled, perfect and complete awakening. Moreover, any woman who hears the name of the thus-gone one Branch Guru and, having heard it, gives rise to faith, will thus be transformed from being a woman. Śāriputra, for that reason, if a son or daughter of noble family were to desire these benefits and give rise to the resolve set on unexcelled, perfect and complete awakening in order to liberate suffering beings, then he or she should hear the name of the thus-gone one Branch Guru. {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-067-005-774,folio:F.293.b}}}

It is because this is the previous aspiration of that very thus-gone one. Therefore, one should have wholehearted faith in the blessed buddhas. Having faith in the blessed buddhas will thus bring great benefit. Through single-pointed faith, one will obtain whatever is desired. {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-067-005-777,folio:F.295.a}}} Those who join their palms with one-pointed faith in thus-gone ones like this who inspire us to uphold their advice and who uttering the words ‘Homage to the buddhas!’ are steadfast in their love, will make irreversible progress toward unexcelled, perfect and complete awakening. If they have wholehearted faith, they will perfect those qualities. Therefore, one should continuously recite the name of the thus-gone one. If those who wish to travel in that vehicle recollect the qualities of that thus-gone one, they will turn away from saṃsāra in fourteen eons.

They will become impervious to the control of Māra and his entourage. They will be rescued from grave battles and obtain the wisdom of omniscience. Śāriputra, the sons or daughters of noble family who become faithful and delighted through just recollecting the name of that thus-gone one should think, while engaging in conduct for the sake of awakening, ‘We shall see the thus-gone one and know him perfectly!’

Suppose someone were to fill with jewels as many world systems as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River and offer them to as many blessed buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, every day, for as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. The heap of merit from that would not compare to even a fraction of the heap of merit that comes from hearing the name of a thus-gone one. Suppose someone, with the wish to hear the name, were to make an offering of that many world systems filled with the seven kinds of precious substances. Without having made the requisite merit, even that person would not be able to hear it. Why is that? It is because if one were to hear the name without making the necessary merit, then even hell beings, animals, beings in the world of Yama, and the long-lived gods would hear it and understand the qualities extolled. For they would all possess the right amount of merit.

Śāriputra, they should not commit any evil deeds. I have taught that one should not give rise to ill will even toward a burnt log, much less a human. Furthermore, if getting angry even at ordinary humans leads to rebirth plagued by the many kinds of suffering of the terrible hells, how much worse is getting angry at the faithful who have devotion for the teachings of the thus-gone ones, let alone getting angry at a thus-gone one endowed with infinite wisdom? For I have not seen those foolish beings escape such a fate in one, two, three, or even as many as a hundred eons, and they do not escape from the hells in even a trillion eons. I have taught that those who forsake the awakening of the buddhas will suffer. One should give rise to the mind of awakening with the following thought: ‘Anyone who does not forsake the authentic way of Dharma, whose words do not preach duality, will come to acquire, without ever regressing, the wisdom of the buddhas!’

Moreover, those with meager insight cannot aspire for this great wisdom. I have seen that those with more expansive insight will become filled with faith upon hearing this name proclaimed. They will truly achieve insight from other buddhas for many eons. Śāriputra, it is impossible and implausible for those that hear this Dharma from other buddhas in the final period of five hundred years to be impious, distrustful, and misunderstand it. This is impossible and implausible because they will turn away from saṃsāra in forty-five eons.

When it comes to the thus-gone ones’ virtues so extolled, the wisdom of a thus-gone one cannot be assessed by the knowledge of an ordinary being, indeed the wisdom of buddhas{{note:{index30,id:UT22084-067-005-174}}} cannot be assessed by even pratyekabuddhas. Thus, based on learning these examples, one should not deride the wisdom of buddhas, just as one should not take up actions by which a single intention or verbal act will lead to the many kinds of births in the terrible hells. Why is that? It is because it is rare for the blessed buddhas to appear in the world. It is even rarer to be born as a human and obtain excellent leisure. I will offer an analogy to illustrate this point. Śāriputra, suppose for example that this great earth were one giant ocean, and within it, there were a yoke with one opening and a blind tortoise. Suppose that across that giant ocean there blew the wind called the one that blows up and down. {{page:{number:30,id:UT22084-067-005-792,folio:F.302.b}}} Suppose now that the blind tortoise were to surface once every hundred years. One might say that the neck of the blind tortoise that surfaces suddenly once every hundred years might enter the opening of the yoke; not so for becoming a human after falling into the lower realms. It is much rarer for those who have fallen into the lower realms to later become human.
