{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-071-006-60}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was traveling through the land of Vṛji and had arrived in Vaiśālī. He had taken up residence at the Kūṭāgāraśālā, on the banks of the Monkey Pond near Vaiśālī.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-071-006-61}}}At that time, a large group of merchants from Vaiśālī was preparing for a journey to the land of Takṣaśilā in order to trade. These many merchants of Vaiśālī heard that the Blessed One was traveling through the land of Vṛji, had arrived in Vaiśālī, and had taken up residence at the Kūṭāgāraśālā on the banks of the Monkey Pond near Vaiśālī. When they heard this, they gathered in groups and banded together in bands,{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-071-006-62}}} left Vaiśālī, and went to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-071-006-63}}}On arrival, they bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side. The Blessed One taught, instructed, encouraged, and delighted the many merchants of Vaiśālī, who were seated to one side, with a Dharma talk. Having taught, instructed, encouraged, and delighted them with a Dharma talk on various topics, the Blessed One sat in silence. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-071-006-64}}}The many merchants of Vaiśālī then rose from their seats and, draping their robes over their left shoulders, bowed to the Blessed One with joined palms. “Honored One,” they addressed the Blessed One, “we are a large group of merchants from Vaiśālī preparing for a journey to the land of Takṣaśilā in order to trade goods. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-071-006-177,folio:F.262.b}}} Would the Blessed One and the saṅgha of monks agree to take their midday meal at our place tomorrow?”

The many merchants of Vaiśālī recognized that the Blessed One had agreed by remaining silent. They praised what the Blessed One had taught and rejoiced. They bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and departed from his presence.

Rising early the next morning, they prepared the seating and set out the water jugs. They then extended their invitation to the Blessed One: “Honored One, the meal has been prepared, and the time has come. Please, Blessed One, know that the time has now come.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-071-006-67}}}That morning, the Blessed One donned his lower garment and upper robe and took up his alms bowl. Surrounded by a group of monks at the head of the saṅgha of monks, he proceeded to the dining hall of the many merchants of Vaiśālī. When he arrived, he sat on the seat that had been prepared for him amid the gathering of monks. The many merchants of Vaiśālī then bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side. The Blessed One gave the following teaching to the many merchants of Vaiśālī, who were seated to one side.
