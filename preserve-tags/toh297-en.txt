Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī. At that time, Venerable Ānanda went alone into the forest. Once he was settled in meditation, the following thought arose in his mind: “Whatever dangers arise, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned. Whatever calamity,{{note:{index13,id:UT22084-071-011-35}}} whatever harm, contagious illness, or conflict arises, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned.”{{note:{index14,id:UT22084-071-011-36}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-071-011-37}}}In the afternoon, Venerable Ānanda rose from his meditation and went to where the Blessed One was. He bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side. Once seated to one side, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “Honorable One, today I went into the forest, and while settled in meditation, the following thought came to my mind: ‘Whatever dangers arise, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned. Whatever calamity, whatever harm, contagious illness, or conflict arises, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned.’ ” {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-071-011-149,folio:F.297.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-071-011-38}}}“Ānanda, it thus! It is thus! Whatever dangers arise, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned. Whatever calamity, whatever harm, contagious illness, or conflict arises, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned.{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-071-011-39}}} Ānanda, consider this analogy: if a house made of dried reeds or a house made of hay, or a pile of dry straw, is set on fire, it will indeed be burnt.{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-071-011-40}}} In the same way, whatever dangers arise, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned. Whatever calamity, whatever harm, contagious illness, or conflict arises, all of them arise from foolishness, not from being learned. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-071-011-41}}}“Ānanda, in the past, whatever dangers arose, all of them arose from foolishness, not from being learned. Whatever calamity, whatever harm, contagious illness, or conflict arose, all of them arose from foolishness, not from being learned. Ānanda, in the future, whatever dangers may arise, all of them will arise from foolishness, not from being learned. Whatever calamity, whatever harm, contagious illness, or conflict may arise, all of them will arise from foolishness, not from being learned. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-071-011-42}}}“Ānanda, in this way, in the past, in the future, and in the present, those who encounter danger are the foolish, and those who are free of danger are the learned. Those with calamity are the foolish, and those without calamity are the learned. Those with harm are the foolish, and those without harm are the learned. Those with contagious illness are the foolish, and those without contagious illness are the learned. Those with conflict are the foolish, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-071-011-150,folio:F.298.a}}} and those without conflict are the learned. Ānanda, you should know that danger, as well as calamity, harm, contagious illness, and conflict, are from foolishness, they are not from being learned.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-071-011-43}}}“So, Ānanda, you should understand the qualities of the foolish and the qualities of the learned, and having understood the qualities of the foolish and the qualities of the learned, you should abandon the qualities of the foolish, and adopt the qualities of the learned. Ānanda, you should train in this way.”
