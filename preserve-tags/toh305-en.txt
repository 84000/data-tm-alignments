{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-072-005-38}}}“Monks, there are three declarations of what is supreme.{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-072-005-39}}} What are the three? They are the declaration of the Buddha as supreme, the declaration of the Dharma as supreme, and the declaration of the Saṅgha as supreme.

Those who are well disposed toward the Buddha are well disposed toward what is supreme. Those who are well disposed toward what is supreme, should understand that the ripening thereof will always be as a supreme god among gods, or a supreme human among humans.
