Auspicious Night

{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-072-013-34}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was staying in Rājagṛha’s Bamboo Grove, in the Habitat of Kalandaka Birds. At that time, a certain monk was residing on the banks of Rājagṛha’s hot springs. When night had fallen, a deity with a brilliant golden complexion appeared before the monk and{{note:{index11,id:UT22084-072-013-36}}} illuminated the entire bank of the hot springs with a vast radiance. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-072-013-37}}}The deity asked, “Monk, do you know the teaching of Auspicious Night?” 
The monk replied, “Deva, I am ignorant of the teaching of Auspicious Night. Now, are you, Deva, aware of the teaching of Auspicious Night,  or are you unaware of it? 
“Monk, I too do not know the teaching of Auspicious Night.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-072-013-40}}}In turn, the monk asked, “Deva, who then exists who knows the teaching of Auspicious Night?” 
The deity said, “The Bhagavān is staying nearby in Rājagṛha’s Bamboo Grove, in the Habitat of Kalandaka Birds. Go straight to the Bhagavān and ask him! Retain the Bhagavān’s instruction exactly as it is given to you, and apply yourself to it!” He then disappeared suddenly. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-072-013-42}}}The next morning,{{note:{index12,id:UT22084-072-013-43}}} the monk went to the Bhagavān. On arriving, he bowed his head to the Bhagavān’s feet and remained to one side. Sitting to the side of the Bhagavān, the monk asked the Bhagavān, “Venerable sir, last night, after dusk, a deity with a brilliant golden complexion {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-072-013-312,folio:F.162.a}}} appeared before me and illuminated the entire bank of the hot springs with a vast radiance. The deity said to me, ‘Monk, do you know the teaching of Auspicious Night?’ I replied, ‘Deva, I am ignorant of the teaching of Auspicious Night. Now, are you, Deva,{{note:{index13,id:UT22084-072-013-44}}} aware of the teaching of Auspicious Night, or are you unaware of it?’ ‘Monk, I too do not know the teaching of Auspicious Night,’ the deity responded. ‘Deva, who then exists who knows the teaching of Auspicious Night?’ The deity then said, ‘The Bhagavān is staying in Rājagṛha’s Bamboo Grove, in the Habitat of Kalandaka Birds. Go straight to the Bhagavān and ask him! Retain the Bhagavān’s instruction exactly as it is given to you, and apply yourself to it!’ He then disappeared suddenly. Therefore, Venerable Bhagavān, I have come to ask you the meaning of this.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-072-013-45}}}The Bhagavān asked, “Monk, do you know that deity?” 
“Sir, I do not know that deity,” the monk replied. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-072-013-47}}}“This deity is a general{{note:{index14,id:UT22084-072-013-48}}} of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. His name is Candana.”{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-072-013-49}}}
“Sir, I wish to hear the teaching of Auspicious Night,” the monk entreated. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-072-013-51}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Then, monk, listen well and carefully, and pay attention! I will teach you. Monk, when monks are endowed with three special qualities, they are called those who abide by the teaching of Auspicious Night. Which three? They are as follows: By possessing the three special qualities of (1) not following after the past,{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-072-013-52}}} (2) not hoping{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-072-013-53}}} for the future, and  (3) remaining uncaptivated by presently arisen states, a monk is known as someone who follows the teaching of Auspicious Night.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-072-013-54}}}This is what the Bhagavān said. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-072-013-313,folio:F.162.b}}} After the Sugata had thus spoken, he furthermore stated the following: 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-072-013-55}}}“Do not follow after{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-072-013-56}}} the past
Or hope for the future! 
What is past has ceased to exist; 
The future has not yet arrived. {1}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-072-013-57}}}“Having thoroughly examined 
Each presently arisen thing,
And knowing each,{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-072-013-58}}} one understands, 
Undeceived by false conceptions. {2} 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-072-013-59}}}“ ‘Will I{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-072-013-60}}} die tomorrow?’ Who knows? 
Today the effort should be made.

{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-072-013-63}}}“May all sentient beings and creatures 
And the entirety of living things

May all good things be seen,{{note:{index23,id:UT22084-072-013-64}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-072-013-69}}}Then the Bhagavān, for the safeguarding of all sentient beings, offered this teaching of Auspicious Night{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-072-013-70}}} and taught the following Dravidian mantras:
