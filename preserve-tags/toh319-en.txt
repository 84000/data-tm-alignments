Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying in Rājagṛha at the Bamboo Grove in the Kalandakanivāpa. One morning, the venerable Ānanda donned his Dharma robe and lower garment, took up his alms bowl, and went into Rājagṛha on his alms round. As he was making his alms round through the city of Rājagṛha, the venerable Ānanda noticed, in a certain direction, a multistoried palace with eighty gateways. It was plastered inside and out; parasols, banners, and pennants were hoisted; and it was adorned with many silken tassels.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-072-019-96}}}Seeing this, the venerable Ānanda thought, “If a faithful son or daughter of good family were to construct such a building and offer it to the saṅgha of monks in the four directions, or if someone were to erect for a thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha a stūpa the size of a gooseberry fruit, provide it with a central pillar the size of a needle and a parasol the size of a jujube leaf, commission a statue the size of a grain of barley, and place in there a relic the size of a mustard seed, which of these two would have the greater merit?” Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda, “Since the Teacher is here with me, the Well-Gone One is here with me, I should ask the Blessed One to clarify this matter. As the Blessed One explains it, so I will remember it.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-072-019-97}}}Then the venerable Ānanda completed his alms rounds in the city of Rājagṛha and finished his meal. Since he was abstaining from accepting subsequent alms food, he put away his Dharma robe and alms bowl. {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-072-019-194}}} He then washed his feet and went to see the Blessed One. Once there, he prostrated at the Blessed One’s feet {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-072-019-179,folio:F.194.b}}} and sat down to one side.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-072-019-98}}}Seated to one side, the venerable Ānanda addressed the Blessed One: “Honorable One, earlier this morning, I donned my Dharma robe and lower garment, took up my alms bowl, and went into Rājagṛha on my alms round. As I went from one house to the next collecting alms in the city of Rājagṛha, I saw, in a certain direction, a multistoried palace with eighty gateways. It was plastered inside and out; parasols, banners, and pennants were hoisted; and it was adorned with many silken tassels. Seeing this, I thought to myself, ‘If a faithful son or daughter of good family were to offer such a building to the saṅgha in the four directions, or if someone were to erect for a thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha, who has passed into parinirvāṇa, a stūpa the size of a gooseberry fruit made of clay, provide it with a central pillar the size of a needle and a parasol the size of a jujube leaf, commission a statue the size of a grain of barley, and place in there a relic the size of a mustard seed, which of these two would have the greater merit?’ Then it occurred to me, ‘Since the Teacher is here with me, the Well-Gone One is here with me, I should ask the Blessed One to clarify this matter. As the Blessed One explains it, so I will remember it.’ If I make this request to the Blessed One, may the Blessed One instruct me thoroughly on this matter by virtue of his compassionate mind.”{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-072-019-99}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-072-019-100}}}When this request was thus made, the Blessed One replied to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda,{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-072-019-101}}} you are dedicated to the welfare of many beings. It is for the happiness of many beings, out of compassion for the world, and for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans that you ask the Thus-Gone One about this issue. Excellent! Excellent! Therefore, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-072-019-180,folio:F.195.a}}} Ānanda, listen well and keep this in mind. I will explain.
