Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was dwelling at the Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha, together with a large saṅgha of one thousand two hundred and fifty monks who surrounded and honored him as he taught the Dharma.{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-072-034-50}}} He expounded that which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, excellent in meaning, excellent in words, unique, perfect, completely pure, thoroughly refined, and concerns pure conduct.{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-072-034-51}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-072-034-52}}}At that time, the layman Nandika and a retinue of five hundred lay practitioners{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-072-034-53}}} departed from the great{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-072-034-54}}} city of Rājagṛha, and went to where the Bhagavān was. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-072-034-230,folio:F.268.b}}} He bowed his head to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān three times, and sat down to one side.{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-072-034-55}}} Then, those five hundred lay practitioners also bowed their heads{{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-072-034-56}}} to the Bhagavān’s feet and sat down to one side.{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-072-034-57}}} Then the layman Nandika asked the Bhagavān, “What sort of ripening will arise for those who violate the five basic precepts of a lay practitioner as prescribed by the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly awakened Buddha who knows and sees?”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-072-034-58}}}The Bhagavān answered the layman Nandika, “Nandika, it is excellent that you have thought to ask the Tathāgata about this matter. Your intellect is vast, your consideration is fine, and your eloquence is excellent.{{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-072-034-59}}} Therefore, Nandika, I shall teach the Dharma discourse called The Ten Negative Consequences.
