{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-076-004-133}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, together with a large monastic community of 1,250 monks. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-076-004-134}}}The Blessed One was respected, honored, revered, and venerated by monks, nuns, devoted laymen, devoted laywomen, kings, ministers, the various tīrthikas, ascetics, brahmins, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-076-004-383,folio:F.50.b}}} practitioners, and wanderers, as well as by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas. The Blessed One received abundant and exquisite requisites—robes, alms, bedding and seating, and medicine in case of illness—both divine and human. Yet, the Blessed One remained untainted by them, like a lotus untainted by water. The Blessed One’s renown, fame, and acclaim,{{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-076-004-135}}} was vast, excellent, and exalted.{{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-076-004-136}}} In this way, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened one, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, the well gone one, the knower of the world, the unsurpassed guide for people to be tamed, the teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One, having directly understood and clearly perceived {{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-076-004-137}}} this world with its gods, māras, brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, gods, and humans,{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-076-004-138}}} was teaching the Dharma{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-076-004-139}}} that is excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end, fine in meaning and fine in expression, and was expounding the entire and complete spiritual life that is completely pure and completely clean. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-076-004-140}}}Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, “Monks, if beings were to know the fruit of giving and the karmic fruition of sharing gifts{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-076-004-141}}} as I know the fruit of giving and the karmic fruition of sharing gifts, they would not eat even their last mouthful, their last morsel, themselves{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-076-004-142}}} without giving, without sharing it with others,{{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-076-004-143}}} and the arisen defilement of selfishness would not remain in possession of their minds.{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-076-004-144}}}{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-076-004-384,folio:F.51.a}}} But, monks, because beings do not know the fruit of giving and the karmic fruition of sharing gifts as I know the fruit of giving and the karmic fruition of sharing gifts, they eat even their last mouthful, their last morsel, themselves{{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-076-004-145}}} without giving, without sharing it with others, and the arisen defilement of selfishness remains in possession of their minds. Why is this?
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-076-004-146}}}“Previously, monks, in a past time, there was a king named Kanakavarṇa, who was handsome, beautiful, and pleasing to behold, being endowed with a sublime golden complexion. That king Kanakavarṇa was rich, wealthy, and prosperous, having abundant possessions;{{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-076-004-147}}} abundant wealth and means; abundant riches, grains, gems, pearls,{{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-076-004-148}}} crystal, coral, gold, and silver; abundant elephants, horses, cows, and stud horses;{{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-076-004-149}}} and treasuries and storehouses that were completely filled. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-076-004-150}}}“King Kanakavarṇa had a royal capital called Kanakāvatī that was twelve yojanas in length from east to west and seven yojanas wide from south to north. It was prosperous, thriving, happy, well provisioned, pleasant, and bustling with many people. King Kanakavarṇa had eighty thousand such cities {{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-076-004-151}}} that were prosperous, thriving, happy, well provisioned, pleasant, and bustling with many people; five hundred and seventy million villages {{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-076-004-152}}} that were prosperous, thriving, happy, well provisioned, pleasant, and bustling with many people; and sixty thousand market towns that were prosperous, thriving, happy, well provisioned, pleasant, and bustling with many people. And, King Kanakavarṇa had eighteen thousand courtiers and a retinue of twenty thousand attendant women. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-076-004-385,folio:F.51.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-076-004-153}}}“Monks, King Kanakavarṇa was righteous and he ruled his kingdom according to the Dharma as a Dharma king.{{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-076-004-154}}} He engaged in all acts of generosity and there was nothing that he had not given away, including the flesh of his own body. During those times people would attain a lifespan of eighty-four thousand years.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-076-004-155}}}“Now, at one time, when King Kanakavarṇa was alone, having withdrawn in private, a deliberation arose in his mind: ‘Let me free all merchants from customs duties and transit fees. Let me free all the people of Jambudvīpa from taxes and fees.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-076-004-156}}}“King Kanakavarṇa thereupon summoned his accountants, ministers, courtiers, gatekeepers, and councilors, and announced to them, ‘As of today, sirs,{{note:{index:40,id:UT22084-076-004-157}}} all merchants should be freed from customs duties and transit fees. All the people of Jambudvīpa should be freed from taxes and fees.’

The brahmins who could understand the indications read the signs{{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-076-004-160}}} and did divinations.{{note:{index:43,id:UT22084-076-004-161}}} Having observed this in the movements of the constellations and the planet Venus, they went to King Kanakavarṇa and said, ‘Your Majesty, please know that the constellations have become adverse such that it will not rain for twelve years.’
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-076-004-162}}}“Upon hearing this news, King Kanakavarṇa broke down in tears, ‘Oh, my people of Jambudvīpa! Oh, my people of Jambudvīpa!{{note:{index:44,id:UT22084-076-004-163}}} Oh, my Jambudvīpa that is prosperous, thriving, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-076-004-386,folio:F.52.a}}} happy, well provisioned, pleasant, and bustling with many people—before long you will be empty and bereft of people!’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-076-004-164}}}“After weeping sorrowfully for a moment, King Kanakavarṇa thought, ‘Those who are rich, wealthy, and prosperous will be able to support themselves, but those who are poor, with little wealth, and with little to eat and drink—how will they survive? Let me collect all the foodstuffs in Jambudvīpa, build a storehouse for all the villages, cities, and market towns, as well as for the royal capital,{{note:{index:45,id:UT22084-076-004-165}}} and distribute an equal share to all the people of Jambudvīpa.’
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-076-004-166}}}“King Kanakavarṇa then summoned his accountants, ministers, courtiers, gatekeepers, and councilors, and ordered, ‘Sirs, go and collect all the foodstuffs in Jambudvīpa, count them and measure them out, and place them in a storehouse for all the villages, cities, and market towns, as well as for the royal capital.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-076-004-167}}}“The accountants, ministers, courtiers, gatekeepers, and councilors did as King Kanakavarṇa had ordered, and when they had stored the foodstuffs in the storehouse, they went to King Kanakavarṇa and said, ‘Your Majesty, please know that the foodstuffs from all the villages, cities, and market towns, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-076-004-387,folio:F.52.b}}} as well as from the royal capital, have all been collected, counted, measured out, and stored in a storehouse for all the villages, cities, and market towns, as well as for the royal capital. What does Your Majesty deem fit now?’
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-076-004-168}}}“King Kanakavarṇa then summoned his counters, accountants, and scribes and ordered, ‘Sirs, go and count all the people of Jambudvīpa.

When they had properly counted everyone, starting with King Kanakavarṇa, they assigned an equal share of food to all the people of Jambudvīpa.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-076-004-173}}}“For eleven years everyone survived, but during the first month of the twelfth year, many men, women, and children began to die from hunger and thirst. As the second, third, fourth, and fifth months passed, many more men, women, and children died.{{note:{index:49,id:UT22084-076-004-174}}} This went on until the eleventh month, when all the food in Jambudvīpa had been exhausted,{{note:{index:50,id:UT22084-076-004-175}}} apart from a single measure of food left for King Kanakavarṇa.
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-076-004-176}}}“Now, at that time, there was a bodhisattva who had been embarked upon the path for forty eons and who had reached this Sahā world. That bodhisattva saw, somewhere in a forest, a son having sexual intercourse with his mother. Seeing this, he thought, ‘Oh, how defiled,{{note:{index:51,id:UT22084-076-004-177}}} how defiled these beings are! {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-076-004-388,folio:F.53.a}}} It was in her womb that he stayed for nine months and it was from her breasts that he drank—and now he does this here!{{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-076-004-178}}} I’ve had enough of such{{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-076-004-179}}} beings who are driven by craven desires not in keeping with the Dharma, who have wrong views, who are overcome by unbearable lust, who do not honor their fathers,{{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-076-004-180}}} their mothers, monks, or brahmins, and who do not respect the elders of their family. Who would bother to practice the conduct of a bodhisattva for the sake of such beings? Surely I should practice for my own sake alone.’
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-076-004-181}}}“Then the bodhisattva went to a tree and sat down at its base. Having crossed his legs and made his body upright, he established mindfulness to the fore.{{note:{index:55,id:UT22084-076-004-182}}} He then dwelled on observing the arising and passing away of the five aggregates that are subject to clinging: ‘This is form, this is the arising of form, this is the vanishing of form; this is feeling; this is perception; these are conditionings; this is consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the vanishing of consciousness.’ As he remained like this, observing the arising and passing away of the five aggregates that are subject to clinging, before long, he realized that whatever is of the nature to arise is all of the nature to cease,{{note:{index:56,id:UT22084-076-004-183}}} and right there he reached individual awakening.

One minister saw the blessed pratyekabuddha coming from a distance. Seeing this, he called the other ministers, ‘Look, sirs, look! From the distance, a red-winged bird is coming toward us here!’

{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-076-004-206}}}“Then the deity of the royal capital Kanakāvatī uttered this verse to King Kanakavarṇa: 
What is suffering? It is to be poor.
What is greater suffering? It is poverty itself.
To be in poverty is the same as death.{{note:{index:65,id:UT22084-076-004-210}}}
