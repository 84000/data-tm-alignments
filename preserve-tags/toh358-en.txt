{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-076-012-111}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling at Śrāvastī in Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-076-012-112}}}One morning, the venerable Ānanda put on his robes, took his alms bowl, and entered the city of Śrāvastī for alms. Afterward, having walked his alms round and having had his meal, the venerable Ānanda went to a well for some water.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-076-012-113}}}At that moment there was an outcaste girl named Prakṛti drawing water at that well. The venerable Ānanda said to the outcaste girl Prakṛti, “Please give me some, sister. I would like to drink some water.”{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-076-012-114}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-076-012-115}}}The outcaste girl Prakṛti replied to the venerable Ānanda, “I am an outcaste girl, Venerable Ānanda.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-076-012-116}}}“Sister, I did not ask you for your family or caste,” said the venerable Ānanda. “Rather, if you can spare some water, please give me some.”{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-076-012-117}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-076-012-118}}}The outcaste girl then gave some water to the venerable Ānanda. After drinking the water, the venerable Ānanda set off.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-076-012-119}}}Having closely and thoroughly taken in the features of the venerable Ānanda’s body, face, and voice, the outcaste girl Prakṛti became engrossed in shallow thoughts. Full of desire, she thought, {M.2} “I wish that the noble Ānanda were my husband. My mother, who is a great holder of spells, should be able to draw in the noble Ānanda and make him my husband.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-076-012-120}}}The outcaste girl Prakṛti then took the water jug and went to her outcaste home. Upon arrival,{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-076-012-121}}} she set the water jug aside and said to her mother, “O mother, listen, there is an ascetic {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-076-012-1943,folio:F.233.a}}} named Ānanda who is a disciple and the attendant of the great ascetic Gautama. I want to have him as my husband. Mother, you should be able to draw him in!”{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-076-012-122}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-076-012-123}}}“My child,”{{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-076-012-124}}} replied her mother, “I should be able to draw in Ānanda, unless he is dead or free from desires. But King Prasenajit of Kauśala is immensely devoted, loyal, and committed to the ascetic Gautama. If he came to know of this, he would bring the entire outcaste family to ruin. I have heard that the ascetic Gautama is free from desires, and one who is free from desire overcomes all.”{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-076-012-125}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-076-012-126}}}When this was said, the outcaste girl Prakṛti said to her mother, “Mother, even if the ascetic Gautama is free from desires, should you not obtain the venerable Ānanda from him, I will forsake my life! If you get him, I will live!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-076-012-127}}}“Do not forsake your life, my child. I will obtain the ascetic Ānanda,” her mother replied.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-076-012-128}}}Thereupon, in the middle of the courtyard,{{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-076-012-129}}} the mother of the outcaste girl Prakṛti smeared cow dung on the floor and shaped it into a ritual platform. After having strewn it with darbha grass, she set it on fire, and she threw one hundred and eight arka flowers into the fire one by one while reciting mantras. This was the formula: {M.3}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-076-012-130}}}Amale vimale kuṅkume sumane | yena baddho ’si vidyut | icchayā devo varṣati vidyotati garjati vismayaṃ mahārājasya samabhi­vardhayituṃ devebhyo manuṣyebhyo gandharvebhyaḥ | śikhigrahā devā viśikhi­grahā devā ānanda­syāgamanāya kramaṇāya juhomi svāhā ||{{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-076-012-131}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-076-012-132}}}At that moment, the venerable Ānanda’s mind became entranced, and he left the monastery and walked to the home of the outcastes. 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-076-012-133}}}When the outcaste mother saw the venerable Ānanda coming from afar, she said to her daughter Prakṛti, “My child, that is the ascetic Ānanda who is coming. Go and prepare a bed.”{{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-076-012-134}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-076-012-135}}}Thrilled, elated, and overjoyed, the outcaste girl Prakṛti set about preparing a bed for the venerable Ānanda. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-076-012-1944,folio:F.233.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-076-012-136}}}When the venerable Ānanda had reached the outcaste house, he approached the ritual platform and stood by its side. He then cried out and wept, “I find myself in this dreadful predicament, and now the Blessed One does not take notice of me!”
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-076-012-137}}}At that very moment, however, the Blessed One took notice of the venerable Ānanda, and having taken notice of him, he immediately vanquished the mantras of the outcaste with the mantras of a perfectly awakened one. This was the formula:
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-076-012-138}}}Sthitir acyutiḥ anīti{{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-076-012-139}}} svasti sarva­prāṇibhyaḥ | {M.4}

{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-076-012-141}}}Then, once the spell of the outcaste had been broken, the venerable Ānanda left the house of the outcastes and began to walk back to his monastery.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-076-012-142}}}The outcaste girl Prakṛti saw this, and as she watched the venerable Ānanda going back, she said to her mother, “Mother, this ascetic Ānanda is going back!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-076-012-143}}}“Surely, my child,” said he mother, “the ascetic Gautama must have noticed him and countered my mantras.”
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-076-012-144}}}“But, mother,” replied Prakṛti, “do we not have mantras more powerful than those of the ascetic Gautama?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-076-012-145}}}“My child,” the mother replied, “we do not have mantras more powerful than those of the ascetic Gautama. Even mantras that are overpowering to the entire world,{{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-076-012-146}}} my child, are all vanquished by the ascetic Gautama when he wishes, but the world does not have the power to counter the mantras of the ascetic Gautama. In this way the mantras of the ascetic Gautama are more powerful.”
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-076-012-147}}}The venerable Ānanda then arrived at where the Blessed One was. Having approached him, he venerated the Blessed One’s feet with his head and stood to one side.{{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-076-012-148}}}{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-076-012-1945,folio:F.234.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-076-012-149}}}As the venerable Ānanda stood there, the Blessed One said to him, “Take up this six-syllable formula, Ānanda, and retain, recite, and master it for the benefit and welfare of yourself, and for the benefit and welfare of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Ānanda, this six-syllable formula has been spoken by the six tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened ones of the past, as well as by the Four Great Kings, by Śakra, lord of the gods, and by Brahmā, lord of this Sahā world. And now it is spoken by me, Śākyamuni,{{note:{index:40,id:UT22084-076-012-150}}} the Perfectly Awakened One. You should therefore retain, recite, and master it. It is as follows: {M.5}

{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-076-012-153}}}“Ānanda, this six-syllable formula offers protection and blessing, such that if one is to be executed, one will be released with the strike of a rod; if one is to be struck with a rod, one will be released with the blow of a fist; and if one is to be struck with the fist, one will be released with a reprimand.”{{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-076-012-154}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-076-012-155}}}“Ānanda, I do not see anything in this world with its gods, its Māra, and its Brahmā, among the multitudes with their ascetics and brahmins, with their groups of gods, humans, and asuras,{{note:{index:43,id:UT22084-076-012-156}}} that can overpower when one is protected by this six-syllable formula, when one is blessed with a protective thread tied around one’s arm—except for the maturation of past karma.” {M.6}
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-076-012-157}}}With the passing of that night, the outcaste girl Prakṛti washed herself,{{note:{index:44,id:UT22084-076-012-158}}} put on new clothes, and adorned herself with a pearl necklace. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-076-012-1946,folio:F.234.b}}} She then went to the city of Śrāvastī, where she stood by the city gate and waited for the venerable Ānanda to come, thinking, “The monk Ānanda will certainly be coming by this road.”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-076-012-159}}}In the morning, the venerable Ānanda put on his robes, took his alms bowl, and entered the city of Śrāvastī for alms. The outcaste girl Prakṛti saw the venerable Ānanda coming from afar, and she followed him closely from behind, going wherever he went and stopping wherever he stopped, standing silently by the door at each house where he entered for alms.{{note:{index:45,id:UT22084-076-012-160}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-076-012-161}}}The venerable Ānanda noticed the outcaste girl Prakṛti following him closely from behind. Embarrassed, intimidated, uneasy, and troubled, he quickly left the city of Śrāvastī and proceeded to Jetavana.{{note:{index:46,id:UT22084-076-012-162}}} When the venerable Ānanda reached the Blessed One, he venerated the Blessed One’s feet with his head and stood to one side. The venerable Ānanda then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, this outcaste girl has been following me closely from behind, going wherever I go, stopping wherever I stop.{{note:{index:47,id:UT22084-076-012-163}}} At each house I enter for alms, she stands silently by the door. Help me, Blessed One. Help me, Well-Gone One.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-076-012-164}}}On hearing this, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Do not be afraid, do not be afraid.”
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-076-012-165}}}The Blessed One then asked the outcaste girl Prakṛti, “Prakṛti, is it that you wish to be married to the monk Ānanda?” {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-076-012-1947,folio:F.235.a}}}
“Venerable Sir, it is my wish,” she replied.{{note:{index:48,id:UT22084-076-012-167}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-076-012-168}}}The Blessed One said, {M.7} “Prakṛti, have your parents given you permission regarding the monk Ānanda?”
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-076-012-169}}}“They have given their permission, Blessed One. They have given their permission, Well-Gone One.”
“Then you must have them give their permission in my presence.”{{note:{index:49,id:UT22084-076-012-171}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-076-012-172}}}In obeisance to the Blessed One, the outcaste girl Prakṛti venerated the Blessed One’s feet with her head, circumambulated him three times, and took her leave of him, setting off to her parents. When she reached her parents, she venerated their feet with her head, stood to one side, and said to her parents, “Mother, father, please grant me to Ānanda in the presence of the ascetic Gautama.”
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-076-012-173}}}At this, her parents went with the outcaste girl Prakṛti to where the Blessed One was. Having approached him, they venerated the Blessed One’s feet with their heads and sat down to one side. The outcaste girl Prakṛti then venerated the Blessed One’s feet with her head and stood to one side. She said to the Blessed One, “These, Blessed One, are my parents, who have come.”
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-076-012-174}}}Thereupon the Blessed One asked the parents of the outcaste girl Prakṛti, “Have you given your daughter Prakṛti permission regarding the monk Ānanda?”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-076-012-175}}}“We have given our permission, Blessed One. We have given our permission, Well-Gone One.” 
“Then you may return to your home.”{{note:{index:50,id:UT22084-076-012-177}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-076-012-178}}}At this, the parents of the outcaste girl Prakṛti venerated the Blessed One’s feet with their heads, circumambulated him three times, and took their leave of him. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-076-012-1948,folio:F.235.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-076-012-179}}}Once he knew that the parents of the outcaste girl Prakṛti had left, the Blessed One asked the outcaste girl Prakṛti, “Prakṛti, do you want to be with the monk Ānanda?” 
“I want to be with him, Blessed One. I want to be with him, Well-Gone One.”
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-076-012-181}}}“If so, Prakṛti, then you should adopt the attire of the monk Ānanda.”
“I will adopt it, Blessed One. I will adopt it, Well-Gone One. Please allow me to go forth, Blessed One. Please allow me to go forth, Well-Gone One.” {M.8}
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-076-012-183}}}Then the Blessed One said to the outcaste girl Prakṛti,{{note:{index:51,id:UT22084-076-012-184}}} “Come, nun, live the spiritual life.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-076-012-185}}}When this was said, the outcaste girl Prakṛti had her hair shaven off and became clad in yellow ochre robes by the Blessed One.{{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-076-012-186}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-076-012-187}}}When he had thus turned the outcaste girl Prakṛti into a nun and allowed her to go forth, the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, uplifted, and inspired her with a dharmic talk. It was a talk to be heard as a remedy for sentient beings who have been stuck in saṃsāra for a long time, that is, a talk about generosity, a talk about ethical conduct, a talk about the heavens, about the dangers associated with sense pleasures,{{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-076-012-188}}} about finding release, about the perils, about the mental afflictions, defilement, and purification, and about the factors pertaining to awakening—these were the things that the Blessed One fully explained to the nun Prakṛti.
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-076-012-189}}}Instructed, encouraged, uplifted, and inspired with a dharmic talk{{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-076-012-190}}} by the Blessed One, the nun Prakṛti had a mind that was elated, propitious, rejoicing, without hindrances, upright, and without rigidity, by which she became ready to understand the teaching of the Dharma.{{note:{index:55,id:UT22084-076-012-191}}}{{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-076-012-1949,folio:F.236.a}}}{M.9} When the Blessed One knew that the nun Prakṛti had a mind that was elated, propitious, rejoicing, without hindrances, and without rigidity, by which she was ready and able to understand the most elevated Dharma teaching,{{note:{index:56,id:UT22084-076-012-192}}} the Blessed One expounded in full to the nun Prakṛti that most elevated Dharma teaching of the blessed buddhas on penetrating the four truths of the noble ones,{{note:{index:57,id:UT22084-076-012-193}}} that is to say, suffering, its origin, cessation, and the way. 
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-076-012-194}}}Then, while sitting there on her seat, the nun Prakṛti directly realized the four truths of the noble ones, that is, suffering, its origin, cessation, and the way. Just as when a spotless cloth fit for dyeing{{note:{index:58,id:UT22084-076-012-195}}} is put in liquid dye it completely absorbs the dye, the nun Prakṛti, while sitting there on her seat, directly realize the four truths of the noble ones, that is, suffering, its origin, cessation, and the way.
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-076-012-196}}}When the nun Prakṛti had thus seen the Dharma, attained the Dharma, realized the Dharma, become unshakable in the Dharma,{{note:{index:59,id:UT22084-076-012-197}}} understood the Dharma as conclusive, turned toward the attainment of the goal,{{note:{index:60,id:UT22084-076-012-198}}} surmounted all doubt, overcome all uncertainty, had no more queries, attained complete confidence,{{note:{index:61,id:UT22084-076-012-199}}} and become one who pursues the Dharma in the Teacher’s instruction, no longer relying on or being led by others, becoming thoroughbred in the teachings,{{note:{index:62,id:UT22084-076-012-200}}} she fell at the Blessed One’s feet and said to the Blessed One, “I have transgressed, Blessed One. I have transgressed, Well-Gone One. Like a fool, like an idiot, like a stupid person, like an unskillful person, I had bad judgment and acted on the wish to have the monk Ānanda as my husband. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-076-012-1950,folio:F.236.b}}} Venerable Sir, I thus see my transgression as a transgression. Seeing this transgression as a transgression, I confess this transgression. I admit that this transgression was a transgression.{{note:{index:63,id:UT22084-076-012-201}}} I am committed to restraint from transgression. Hence, may the Blessed One know of that transgression of mine as a transgression. May he be accepting of it out of compassion.”
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-076-012-202}}}The Blessed One said, “As you stand firmly in refraining from transgression,{{note:{index:64,id:UT22084-076-012-203}}} Prakṛti, you have understood your transgression as a transgression, saying that like a fool, like an idiot, like a stupid person, like an unskillful person, you had bad judgment and acted on the wish to have the monk Ānanda as your husband.{{note:{index:65,id:UT22084-076-012-204}}}{M.10} Since you know your transgression, see your transgression,{{note:{index:66,id:UT22084-076-012-205}}} and are committed to restraint from transgression, I shall be accepting of your transgression as a transgression. Being henceforth committed to restraint, you should expect a growth of wholesome qualities, not a loss.”{{note:{index:67,id:UT22084-076-012-206}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-076-012-207}}}Having been commended and instructed by the Blessed One, the nun Prakṛti withdrew to a solitary place and vigilantly, ardently, mindfully, fully aware, and effortfully dwelled in seclusion.{{note:{index:68,id:UT22084-076-012-208}}} On account of having her hair shaven off, having donned the yellow ochre robes, and having gone forth with perfect faith from home to homelessness, the young lady directly knew, realized, and attained by herself, in this lifetime, the conclusion of the unsurpassable sublime life. She proclaimed, “Birth has come to an end for me, the sublime life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, and I know there is no more cyclic existence from here.”{{note:{index:69,id:UT22084-076-012-209}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-076-012-210}}}Now, the brahmins and householders of Śrāvastī came to hear that an outcaste girl had gone forth under the Blessed One.

How could she enter the communities of brahmins, kṣatriyas, householders, and landlords?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-076-012-213}}}Reflecting on this, he had a fine carriage yoked. After mounting this fine carriage, he departed from Śrāvastī, accompanied by a large group of brahmins and householders from Śrāvastī. As he approached Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park, he went as far as the terrain allowed his carriage to go, and then dismounted from his carriage and entered Anāthapiṇḍada’s park by foot, accompanied by an army of foot soldiers. Having entered, he approached the Blessed One, venerated the Blessed One’s feet with his head, and sat to one side. The large group of brahmins{{note:{index:71,id:UT22084-076-012-214}}} and householders from Śrāvastī likewise venerated the Blessed One’s feet with their heads and sat down to one side. Some engaged in various kinds of pleasant and congenial conversation with the Blessed One and then sat down to one side. Some conveyed their maternal and paternal names and lines of descent{{note:{index:72,id:UT22084-076-012-215}}} in front of the Blessed One and then sat down to one side. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-076-012-1952,folio:F.237.b}}} Some bowed to the Blessed One with folded hands and then sat down to one side.

Thus, in order to tell the account of the nun Prakṛti’s past life, he called for the nun and addressed the monks, “Monks, do you wish to hear from the Tathāgata a Dharma story concerning the nun Prakṛti’s past life?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-076-012-218}}}The monks replied to the Blessed One, “It is an appropriate time, Blessed One. It is an appropriate moment, Well-Gone One, for the Blessed One to tell a Dharma story concerning the nun Prakṛti’s past life. {M.12} After hearing it from the Blessed One, we will retain it.”
