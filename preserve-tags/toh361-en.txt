{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-077-002-96}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-077-002-638,folio:F.14.a}}} Homage to Glorious Kālacakra!{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-077-002-97}}}
Sucandra requested:
The sevenfold and threefold empowerment,
And also the unsurpassable one, O Teacher—
Explain them to me in short,
For the sake of mundane and supramundane accomplishments! {1}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-077-002-100}}}The Illustrious One replied:
Listen, O Sucandra! I will explain to you in summary
The empowerment and its purpose; these sevenfold,
Threefold, and unsurpassable empowerments;
And the movement in the channels and its control. {2}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-077-002-102}}}In the tantras there are three types of summaries
And three types of explanations [pertaining to the Sekoddeśa],
Including the precise summary, the extensive summary,
The precise explanation, and the other (i.e., the extensive explanation). {3}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-077-002-103}}}The summary and explanation
Are referred to as the recitation of the tantra.
The precise summary and the [precise] explanation
Are word-by-word commentaries. {4}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-077-002-104}}}The extensive summary and the [extensive] explanation
Are commentaries that indicate the entirety of the meaning.
They must be composed by those who have obtained supramundane knowledge, 
Not by mere scholars. {5}
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-077-002-106}}}Through these six [summaries and explanations],
The tantra of the Ādibuddha called Kālacakra is perfect:
Perfect through fourfold vajrayoga;
Perfect through the four types of awakening; {6}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-077-002-108}}}Perfect through the psycho-physical aggregates,
Elements, sense bases, and six families;
Perfect through the five chapters, on the world realm and so forth;
And perfect through [adherence to the principle of] two truths. {7}
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-077-002-109}}}First, there is the sevenfold empowerment
To introduce the childish;
Then the threefold one in terms of the relative truth of the world;
And the fourth in terms of the ultimate truth. {8}
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-077-002-110}}}The teaching of myself, the vajra holder,
Concerning phenomena, is in terms of the twofold truth:
The relative truth of the world
And the ultimate truth. {9}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-077-002-111}}}The sevenfold empowerment, O King,
Consists of those of water,
Crown, ribbon, vajra and bell,
Great vow, name, and permission. {10}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-077-002-112}}}The purification of body, speech, and mind, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-077-002-639,folio:F.14.b}}}
With two each, comprise the first six empowerments;
The purification of wisdom, the permission empowerment.
The other purifications are the purification of the elements and so forth: {11}
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-077-002-113}}}The water empowerment is the purification of the elements;
That of the crown is the purification of the psycho-physical aggregates;
That of the ribbon is the purification of the perfections;
Those of the vajra and the bell are for the great immovable bliss {12}
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-077-002-114}}}And one’s uninterrupted buddha speech, respectively—
They are the purification of the sun and moon [so that they are united] into one.
The purification of the objects and sense faculties
Is the vajra vow that remains intact. {13}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-077-002-115}}}The name empowerment is the purification of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity.
That of permission is the purification for achieving buddhahood.
These seven empowerments must only be given
After having created the maṇḍala. {14}
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-077-002-116}}}Next follows the vase empowerment, the secret empowerment,
That called wisdom from a prajñā,
Then, again, that of great prajñā,
Which is known as wisdom gained from her. {15}
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-077-002-117}}}The first three are, respectively, moving, moving, and vibrating,
And the supreme one is beyond vibration.
The first three empowerments are taken, respectively,
As the purification of body, speech, and mind, {16}
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-077-002-118}}}And the fourth is the purification of wisdom.
The purification of body, speech, and mind.
The three correspond to the level of a child, adult, and elder,
And the fourth to the level of the universal ancestor. {17}
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-077-002-119}}}From touching the breast of the prajñā,
There is the bliss of descending bodhicitta.
The adept empowered by the breast is the child
Because such bliss is attained from touching the breast. {18}
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-077-002-120}}}From moving the vajra in the secret part for a long time,
The bliss of the further-descending bodhicitta has arisen.
The adept empowered by the secret part is the adult
Because such bliss is attained from the secret part. {19}
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-077-002-121}}}From moving the vajra in the secret part for a long time,
The bliss of vibration has arisen at the tip of the vajra.
The adept empowered by the wisdom from a prajñā is the elder
Because of having realized the bliss from vibration. {20}
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-077-002-122}}}That which has arisen from passion for the mahāmudrā
Is bliss without vibration.
The adept empowered by the great prajñā is the universal ancestor
Because he realizes the [blissful] state without vibration. {21}
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-077-002-123}}}The universal ancestor should be known
As the creator of all protectors.
Being in a state without duality or movement,
He is called Vajrasattva, the Great Being, and Bodhisattva, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-077-002-640,folio:F.15.a}}} {22}
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-077-002-124}}}The Commitment Being,
Fourfold Vajrayoga,
And finally, here, Kālacakra—
The one bestowing liberation on yogins. {23}
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-077-002-125}}}This practice must be accomplished
Through manifestations, that are not mentally produced (Skt. acintitaiḥ),{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-077-002-705}}}
Namely, the ten signs beginning with smoke,
Which are reflections of insight, similar to the sky. {24}
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-077-002-126}}}They are beyond existence and nonexistence.
Their status (Skt. artha) is certain from one’s own experience.
They are entirely devoid
Of accumulations of atoms and particles. {25}
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-077-002-127}}}They are smoke, a mirage,
A firefly, a lamp, a flame, the moon, the sun,
Darkness, digit of the moon, and the great drop—
This clear reflection of everything. {26}
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-077-002-128}}}With eyes neither closed nor open,
This reflection is seen in emptiness,
Like in a dream. Without conceptualizing it,
One must constantly meditate on this reflection. {27}
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-077-002-129}}}Once the reflection [is seen] in the non-existent (i.e., cloudless sky),
The meditation is not the [conceptual] meditation of yogins;
To the mind appears neither existence nor nonexistence,
Because of seeing the reflection of emptiness{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-077-002-130}}} without having imagined them. {28}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-077-002-131}}}Just as a virgin sees in the divinatory mirror
The magical image of something unreal,
So, too, the yogin of true reality sees in space
Past and future phenomena. {29}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-077-002-132}}}The object in the reflection is not something real
Because she sees what is empty of real entities.
Something consisting of nonexistent entities
Is like an illusion, a dream, or magic. {30}
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-077-002-133}}}Yet, even though it does not exist,
The manifestation of a phenomenon is observed.
It is like a wish-fulfilling jewel
That fulfills the hopes of limitless beings. {31}
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-077-002-134}}}In the magical image, the virgin
Sees a thief and so forth not yet seen [by the officiants].
Having gone there, the officiants of the divination
See him with their ordinary eyes. {32}
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-077-002-135}}}If she sees a real form,
Why does she not see her own face?
But if she sees an unreal form,
Why does she not see a hare’s horn? {33}
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-077-002-136}}}She sees neither with other/superior eyes,{{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-077-002-706}}}
Nor with her own eyes.
What is being seen has not arisen—
It is like the child of a virgin. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-077-002-641,folio:F.15.b}}} {34}
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-077-002-137}}}Once the reflection is seen,
One must immediately perform breath control,
Because body, speech, and mind
Should be arrested in the three upper and three lower channels. {35}
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-077-002-138}}}With regard to the channels—which are the path for
The moon, the sun, Rāhu, excrement, urine, and semen,
And which correspond to the families of the elements of
Water, fire, space, earth, wind, and wisdom— {36}
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-077-002-139}}}The channels of body, speech, and mind are taught to be,
With regard to the vital wind and downward-moving wind, respectively,
The channels of the moon, the sun, and Rāhu,
As well as those of excrement, urine, and semen. {37}
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-077-002-140}}}The moon is the body of means,
The sun is the speech of insight,
The channel of excrement is the body of insight,
The channel of urine is the speech of the omnipresent. {38}
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-077-002-141}}}One upward and one downward—the two channels of mind
Carry Rāhu and the semen, respectively.
The mind of means is the channel of Rāhu,
And the mind of insight is the channel of semen. {39}
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-077-002-142}}}Upward and downward and combined with body, speech, and mind,
These channels are the six families.
They reside in embodied beings
As the aspects of means and the aspects of insight. {40}
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-077-002-143}}}Due to strong winds above and below,
Signs of death emerge in the channels of body and speech.
Birth, death, and duration
Are related to the channels of Rāhu and of semen. {41}
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-077-002-144}}}At the time of birth, death, and during intercourse,
The channel of semen [swells].
Rāhu flows upward during equinox,
When the sun passes [from one sign to the other]. {42}
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-077-002-145}}}At the moment of transit, [each time] the ascendant rises,
The middle channel carries the breath of equinox.
It lasts fifty-six and one-quarter breaths, O protector of men,
Counting inhalation and exhalation as one. {43}
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-077-002-146}}}In one day and night there are six hundred
Seventy-five [breaths in the middle channel].
The winds—twenty-one thousand
Six hundred times {44}
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-077-002-147}}}Minus those [675 breaths]—
Flow in the left and right channels.
They flow in the middle channel for three years
And three fortnights during one hundred years. {45}
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-077-002-148}}}In the upper part, the left and right channels
Are the moon, lalanā, and iḍā; and the sun, piṅgalā, and the other (i.e., rasanā).
These two have the nature of water and fire,
And are taken to hold the lotus (i.e., Amitābha) and the jewel (i.e., Ratnasambhava). {46}
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-077-002-149}}}In the lower part, there are the two channels of excrement and urine, 
Having the nature of earth and wind. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-077-002-642,folio:F.16.a}}}
They are the middle and left channels,
And are known to hold the disc (i.e., Vairocana) and the sword (i.e., Amoghasiddhi). {47}
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-077-002-150}}}In the upper and the lower part, the middle and right channel,
Are those of Rāhu and semen.
They have the nature of emptiness and wisdom,
And both are known to hold vajras (i.e., Akṣobhya and Vajrasattva). {48}
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-077-002-151}}}The channel of excrement connects with the path of the moon,
The channel of urine with the path of the sun,
And the channel of semen with the path of Rāhu.
The latter is responsible for birth, death, [the breath of] equinox, and intercourse. {49}
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-077-002-152}}}The avadhūtī above the navel is called
Suṣumnā, the channel of darkness.
The channel of the semen below is called
Sky-goer face (Skt. khagamukhā) and conch-shell channel (Skt. śaṅkhinī). {50}
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-077-002-153}}}Passing through the lotuses of the navel, heart, throat,
Forehead, and crown of the head,
[The vital wind in the avadhūtī] transports earth into water, water into fire,
Fire into wind, and wind into emptiness—in the mode of dissolution. {51}
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-077-002-154}}}Exhaling and inhaling again,
It reenters the earth element by way of production.
The avadhūtī runs
From center to center {52}
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-077-002-155}}}And carries body, speech, and mind
At the navel and the secret lotus of the jewel.
Exhaling and inhaling,
It has the nature of dissolution and production, respectively. {53}
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-077-002-156}}}The śaṅkhinī carries the downward-moving wind
Of all living beings.
Due to the bliss of [enjoying] women,
It carries semen; and at the time of menstruation it carries blood. {54}
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-077-002-157}}}The left and right channels above,
And those carrying excrement and urine below,
Refer to the factors of insight and means respectively,
As do the channels of menstrual blood and semen. {55}
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-077-002-158}}}Carrying menstrual blood, the śaṅkhinī is called caṇḍālī.
Carrying semen, it is called khagamukhā.
Above, the avadhūtī is called ḍombī in women referring to menstruation;
In men it is called avadhūtī. {56}
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-077-002-159}}}The five maṇḍalas, starting with consciousness,
Always flow in the left channel;
The ones starting with earth, in the right channel;
The sixth (i.e., that of wisdom), in the middle channel. {57}
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-077-002-160}}}On the lotus petals at the level of the navel are,
In successive order, sixty maṇḍalas.
At the time of the left and right ascendants,
Constituted by the six starting with Aries and the six starting with Taurus, {58}
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-077-002-161}}}The vital breath flows in the two nostrils in due order
To the base, the left, the right, above, and to the middle,
Passing through one maṇḍala after the other,
Starting with earth, during each daṇḍa.{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-077-002-162}}}{{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-077-002-643,folio:F.16.b}}} {59}
{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-077-002-163}}}One nāḍikā{{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-077-002-164}}} successively
Carries 360 breaths.
Five of them
Carry 1,800. {60}
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-077-002-165}}}One day and night have 60 nāḍikās;
They are the maṇḍalas of the body [starting with earth].
The vital breath flows to the center of the petals (space) and then, in due order,
Above (wind), to the right (fire), left (water), and below (earth). {61}
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-077-002-166}}}In the left nostril the elements always start with space,
And in the right with earth in reverse order.
In the left occurs formation starting with consciousness,
And in the right occurs dissolution starting with earth. {62}
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-077-002-167}}}The earth is below and the wind above—
They are insight and means respectively.
Therefore, the [secret] empowerment happens through
The thumb and the ring finger in the mouth [of the disciple]. {63}
{{milestone:{label:1.64,id:UT22084-077-002-168}}}Fire is on the right and water on the left—
They are insight and means respectively.
Therefore, the mudrā of the sword is formed with
The middle and index fingers. {64}
{{milestone:{label:1.65,id:UT22084-077-002-169}}}The void is above and the immovable below—
They are insight and means respectively;
Therefore, the mudrā of the fangs, which has the shape of a half-moon,
Is formed with the little fingers looking like a hooked knife. {65}
{{milestone:{label:1.66,id:UT22084-077-002-170}}}The union of the ten maṇḍalas
Is that of the ten fingers, one [hand] with the other,
Palms joined above the head.
This is the mudrā of the one-pointed vajra and knife. {66}
{{milestone:{label:1.67,id:UT22084-077-002-171}}}The equinox in the middle channel
Causes creation and dissolution.
Having entered the middle channel, the psycho-physical aggregates,
Elements, and the three vajras [of body, speech, and mind] become one. {67}
{{milestone:{label:1.68,id:UT22084-077-002-172}}}When the channels of the moon and the sun are blocked,
The channels of excrement and urine become blocked.
When the channel of Rāhu is blocked,
The channel of semen below becomes blocked. {68}
{{milestone:{label:1.69,id:UT22084-077-002-173}}}When [the upper ones] are released, the respective lower ones are then released,
Causing creation and dissolution.
This is the movement in the channels
Along the threefold paths of both the vital wind and the downward-moving wind. {69}
{{milestone:{label:1.70,id:UT22084-077-002-174}}}If excessive vital wind flows
In the left or right channels
For one or five nights [and days],
Then one will die within three years. {70}
{{milestone:{label:1.71,id:UT22084-077-002-175}}}[If the vital wind flows] with the death sign of the sun in the right channel,
For five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five,
Twenty-six, and twenty-seven [nights and] days,
Then for thirty-three (i.e., fifteen, ten, five, and three nights and days), {71}
{{milestone:{label:1.72,id:UT22084-077-002-176}}}The life of embodied beings will be gone {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-077-002-644,folio:F.17.a}}}
Within a period of three, two, or one year,
Six, three, two, or one month,
Fifteen, ten, five, or three days, respectively. [Then only] two, [and finally only] one day [are left].{{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-077-002-177}}} {72}
{{milestone:{label:1.73,id:UT22084-077-002-178}}}With the ascent of the moon from the base
In the left channel, one by one,
For days and months,
In steps of three days and three months, {73}
{{milestone:{label:1.74,id:UT22084-077-002-179}}}The days of death signs increase
And the months of virtue decrease.
Further, death ascends in the middle channel
At the completion of one hundred years. {74}
{{milestone:{label:1.75,id:UT22084-077-002-180}}}Its ascent occurs in relation to even and odd days
And in relation to the maṇḍalas arisen at the time of birth
Once the two parts [of the lotus] on the right and left side
[Consisting of six petals each] have been destroyed. {75}
{{milestone:{label:1.76,id:UT22084-077-002-181}}}Otherwise, there will be no death
When the two parts [of the lotus] remain
Due to the movement of [vital wind in those] left and right parts,
And because the five maṇḍalas [of earth and the rest] remain active. {76}
{{milestone:{label:1.77,id:UT22084-077-002-182}}}Knowing the defining characteristics of the death signs,
[The adept] must bring the vital wind into the drop.
Based on the bottom of the avadhūtī,
Great immovable bliss must be cultivated. {77}
{{milestone:{label:1.78,id:UT22084-077-002-183}}}One needs to keep the vajra continuously erect,
Because the paths of the moon and the sun are suppressed.
Otherwise, the vital wind
Will not enter the body of the avadhūtī, {78}
{{milestone:{label:1.79,id:UT22084-077-002-184}}}Nor will the downward-moving wind enter the śaṅkhinī;
And, as a consequence, there will be death.
This circumvention of the death signs
Will occur through the four joys of the yogin. {79}
{{milestone:{label:1.80,id:UT22084-077-002-185}}}The initial joy is the descent of the semen
From the lotus at the crown of the head to the one between the eyebrows.
Between the throat and the heart there is the supreme joy;
From there, descending further, the intense joy. {80}
{{milestone:{label:1.81,id:UT22084-077-002-186}}}This variegated joy (i.e., intense joy) [occurs until the semen is] at the navel.
At this point, having entered the secret lotus,
The semen descends into the vajra jewel,
Causing coemergent joy—so long as it is not emitted. {81}
{{milestone:{label:1.82,id:UT22084-077-002-187}}}Therefore he is called the all-pervading lord of immovable great passion.
Being in nonabiding nirvāṇa, [he avoids these two situations:]
[The semen abiding at the crown of the head] due to the lack of passion,
And blissful emission, which is abiding nirvāṇa.{{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-077-002-188}}} {82}
{{milestone:{label:1.83,id:UT22084-077-002-189}}}The manifestation of the moon drop of semen is located at the crown of the head,
And the phase of the full moon in the lotus of the secret part.
The sixteenth phase is located in the lotus of the jewel,
At the tip of the vajra. {83}
{{milestone:{label:1.84,id:UT22084-077-002-190}}}After that, at the beginning of the dark period,
There is the phase of emission.
The sun, because of the absence of passion,
Arrives at the place of the tuft [between the eyebrows] at the time of the new moon. {84}
{{milestone:{label:1.85,id:UT22084-077-002-191}}}The sixteenth solar phase {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-077-002-645,folio:F.17.b}}}
Is located in the lotus at the crown of the head.
Because of non-attachment to passionate bliss in this state,
It is called moonless. {85}
{{milestone:{label:1.86,id:UT22084-077-002-192}}}In all corporeal beings, at the time of death,
The lunar nectar moves downward;
The solar blood upward; and the consciousness, which is Rāhu,
To what is characterized by becoming (i.e., rebirth). {86}
{{milestone:{label:1.87,id:UT22084-077-002-193}}}For this reason, O King,
You must make the lunar nectar move upward,
The solar blood downward,
And the consciousness, which is Rāhu, to immovable bliss. {87}
