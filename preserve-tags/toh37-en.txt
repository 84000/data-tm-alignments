Thus did I hear at one time.{{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-034-025-84}}} The Bhagavān was staying in the Bhesakalā grove deer park{{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-034-025-85}}} at Suṃsumāragiri{{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-034-025-86}}} in the country of the Bhaggas.{{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-034-025-87}}} Early one morning, the Bhagavān, having donned his outer robe and taken up his bowl,{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-034-025-88}}} went to the dwelling of the householder{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-034-025-89}}} Nakulapitā and, having approached, sat down on a prepared seat. Then the householders Nakulapitā and Nakulamātā{{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-034-025-90}}} approached the Bhagavān, greeted him reverently, and sat down to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-034-025-91}}}Sitting to one side, the householder Nakulapitā addressed the Bhagavān: “Ever since, Venerable Bhagavān, the householder Nakulamātā was brought to me as a young girl when I was still a child, not even the thought of being unfaithful to Nakulamātā has occurred to me, and there has been no physical wrongdoing. Bhagavān, this is our mutual experience in this life, and we wish to share this experience in other lives, too.”{{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-034-025-92}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-034-025-93}}}Then the householder Nakulamātā addressed the Bhagavān: “Ever since, Venerable Bhagavān, I was brought as a girl to householder Nakulapitā when he was still young, not even the thought of being unfaithful to Nakulapitā has occurred to me, and there has been no physical wrongdoing. Bhagavān, this is our mutual experience in this life, and we wish to share this experience in other lives, too.”{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-034-025-94}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-034-025-95}}}Then the Bhagavān said,{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-034-025-96}}} “When a husband and wife both have that wish and have had this mutual experience in this life, they will share this experience in other lives, too. By being equal in faith, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-034-025-375,folio:F.271.b}}} equal in ethical discipline, equal in generosity, and equal in wisdom, both of you have had this mutual experience in this life, and you will share this experience in other lives, too.”{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-034-025-97}}}
Then he spoke the following verses:{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-034-025-99}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-034-025-100}}}“A man and woman like this,
Who speak to each other lovingly,
Who are both faithful, generous, and self-controlled,{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-034-025-389}}}
And who live in accordance with the Dharma,
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-034-025-102}}}“Will have abundant wealth
And will be reborn in a good situation.
Their enemies will become unhappy,{{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-034-025-103}}}
And when both are equal in ethical discipline,
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-034-025-104}}}“And have practiced the Dharma in this life
With equal virtue and good conduct,
They will next enjoy a deva world
Where they will delight in sensual pleasures.{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-034-025-106}}}
“Therefore, one should guard the five precepts.{{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-034-025-108}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-034-025-1107}}}“These are (1) refraining from killing, (2) refraining from taking what has not been given, (3) refraining from sexual misconduct, (4) refraining from lying, and (5) refraining from drinking alcohol that leads to intoxication. These are the five precepts that one should guard.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-034-025-110}}}The monks then inquired about the benefits of the five disciplines: “How else, Venerable Bhagavān, should the karmic fruition of refraining from killing be understood? How should the karmic fruition of refraining from taking what has not been given be understood? How should the karmic fruition of refraining from sexual misconduct be understood? How should the karmic fruition of refraining from lying be understood? And how should the karmic fruition of refraining from drinking alcohol that leads to intoxication be understood?”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-034-025-112}}}The Bhagavān responded to their questions so as to be well understood: “Monks, you should regard killing as being like a venomous snake. It is accompanied by many wrongdoings and leads to rebirth in the realm of ghosts, the animal realm, and the hell realms. After the destruction of the body, after death,{{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-034-025-113}}} one will be born in the Reviving Hell. There, the guardians of the Reviving Hell {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-034-025-376,folio:F.272.a}}} will thoroughly roast one’s body, and then cut it to pieces with a variety of blades and gouge holes in it. Forced to undergo the so-called “fivefold ordeal,”{{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-034-025-114}}} the denizens of this hell repeatedly die and are repeatedly revived and reborn in the Reviving Hell. 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-034-025-115}}}“The karmic fruition for those who weightily take life is to be overwhelmed again and again by all these terrible, harsh, and intense sufferings of the Reviving Hell.{{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-034-025-116}}} Even if they are reborn as a human, their lives will be short, their sense faculties defective. They will be ugly, lacking insight, always fearful, and always angry. They will be disease ridden, full of sorrow, and devoid of joy. They will have nothing, and they will have nothing for a very long time.” 
For that reason, the Bhagavān has said:{{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-034-025-118}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-034-025-119}}}“Being reborn for five hundred rebirths 
As ghosts, fish, snakes, game, owls,

{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-034-025-1119}}}This is the karmic fruition of killing.

Those who take from others by deception in order to make a living likewise eventually take what has not been given and will, after the destruction of the body, after death, be reborn in the Wailing hells.

At intervals, the entire hell is filled with a blazing fire. In the Wailing Hell of Smoke, fumes billow. In both, the denizens of the Wailing hells are cooked by flames.

The karmic fruition for anyone who steals is very grave. Even if reborn as a human, their resources will be depleted, and those who have taken what has not been given will be unable to hold on to even the smallest things. It will be difficult for them to obtain food, drink, clothing, a mat, and so forth. They will be in constant discomfort and will be hateful and hostile toward others. Whatever they do manage to obtain they will lose again, and others will enjoy it instead. What they desire will be difficult to obtain, and things they already possess will not be productive. They will be devoid of happiness.”

So, too, when a word spoken is cut short by a sword, two words will not be uttered.{{note:{index:76,id:UT22084-034-025-210}}} But, by speaking the truth over a long period of time, ascetics and brahmins reach liberation after they die.
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-034-025-211}}}“Drinking alcohol leads to falling into and being reborn in the Burning Hell.{{note:{index:77,id:UT22084-034-025-212}}} Beings who have fallen into this hell will be cooked for many thousands of years. After that, they are discarded on the bank of Vaitaraṇī River. With no way across, they try again and again to swim, whereupon the guards of that hell will pull them out with hooks, like fish, and toss them down on the ground of burning iron and bellow, ‘Oi, what do you want?’ ‘Lord, I am parched,’ the beings will reply, and the guardians of that hell will rip open their mouths with red-hot iron hooks and pour molten iron into their gaping mouths. First, their {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-034-025-383,folio:F.275.b}}} lips and throats will be scorched. Next their chests burn, then their bowels, and their hearts will burn, too, until the molten iron forces its way out through the anus. Such are the torments they are made to experience, weeping and rolling{{note:{index:78,id:UT22084-034-025-213}}} on the floor in pain. However, even then they will not die. They will experience these sensations, the karmic ripening of their actions, for as long as the fruits of their negative actions last.” 
For that reason, the Bhagavān has said: 
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-034-025-215}}}“The caustic and rough river Vaitaraṇī,
Without a ford, is very difficult to cross;
With its petals of iron lotuses

How can those who do not follow the Dharma
Ever hope to traverse the bottomless Vaitaraṇī River?
{{milestone:{label:1.64,id:UT22084-034-025-218}}}“For someone to drink alcohol is not a small misdeed. Even if they are reborn as a human, they will always be absent-minded and as dull, stupid, and unaware as a sheep. Constantly falling asleep, they will be of low intelligence and very ignorant. They will be scared and fearful, doubtful,{{note:{index:81,id:UT22084-034-025-219}}} divisive, untrustworthy, miserly, envious, and without renunciation. They will be without shame, with no sense of decency, and will have poor discernment.

These are the harms that ensue from having consumed alcohol.
