{{milestone:{label:p,id:UT22084-079-011-prologue}}}Prologue
{{milestone:{label:p.1,id:UT22084-079-011-16}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-079-011-366,folio:F.187.a}}} I pay homage to Glorious Vajrasattva!
{{milestone:{label:p.2,id:UT22084-079-011-364}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One dwelt in equanimity in the womb of the Vajra Lady, which is the enlightened body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas.
Then, the entourage, including the bodhisattva Vajragarbha and others, performed three circumambulations counterclockwise, made outer, inner, and secret offerings, and asked the following:
{{milestone:{label:p.3,id:UT22084-079-011-17}}}“O Blessed Vajra Holder!
What is ‘secret’?
How is it resolved?
What is the meaning of ‘tantra’?
And what is its king?”
{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-079-011-chapter-1}}}The First Secret
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-079-011-18}}}The Blessed One said:
“ ‘Secret’ is fourfold.
First is the practice of the development stage
Related to the vase initiation.
I taught meditation on the support and the supported
So that practitioners might relinquish
Dualistic concepts of a universe and its inhabitants.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-079-011-19}}}“Its individual features all have an intended meaning.
Initially, in other tantras,
I taught about emptiness and so forth.
Among the particulars of the support and supported,
The first concerns the intention behind the support.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-079-011-20}}}“Imagine that, like one candle lighting another,
The syllable hūṁ at the heart
Projects a black-hued e,
Which forms a vast, deep triangle.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-079-011-21}}}“The three corners are enlightened body, speech, and mind.
This signifies the destruction of the three poisons.
The sides are the three liberations.
This signifies the destruction of the ten nonvirtues
That emerge from ordinary body, speech, and mind. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-079-011-22}}}“The dharma body is immaculate, 
And therefore {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-079-011-367,folio:F.187.b}}} naturally all-pervading.
This is the significance of vast.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-079-011-23}}}“Since even the noble listeners, solitary realizers, 
And bodhisattvas as well
Do not realize the dharma body,
It is explained with intention as deep.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-079-011-24}}}“Then, again, the hūṁ at the heart
Projects a hūṁ syllable that forms into a vajra,
Which forms into a vajra tent.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-079-011-25}}}“There are two obstacles: first, to life,
And second, to liberation.
These are the two obstructing forces,
The outer and the inner.
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-079-011-26}}}“The outer creates obstacles to life;
The inner creates obstacles to liberation.
The significance of the vajra tent 
Is that it protects from these twofold obstructions.
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-079-011-27}}}“Then yaṁ, just as before,
Projects a shape like a half-moon.
It provides control over the abandonment of conceptuality
And the dawn of nonconceptuality.
This is the meaning of domination.
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-079-011-28}}}“Concerning the significance of the four flags,
I have taught that they signify all things
Present throughout the three times.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-079-011-29}}}“The triangular fire maṇḍala from raṁ
Signifies wrathful ritual.
The three-pronged vajra signifies the three buddha bodies.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-079-011-30}}}“The round water disk from baṁ
Is said to be the cessation of mental activity.
The vase is the four aspects of the dharma body.
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-079-011-31}}}“The square golden earth from laṁ
Has the nature of prosperity.
The five-pronged vajra is the five gnoses.
The eight peaks of Mount Meru above that
Signify the eight liberations.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-079-011-32}}}“Symbolizing the absence of conceptuality about an ordinary universe and inhabitants,
The eight charnel grounds 
Should be arranged to the left and right in order.
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-079-011-33}}}“The concepts related to each feature, moreover,
Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-079-011-34}}}“Symbolizing the power of the antidote fully developed,
Trees are continuously arranged in sequence.
The directional protectors are arranged as symbols 
For the overcoming of concepts oriented toward the ten nonvirtues.
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-079-011-35}}}“The eight nāgas are stationed
To destroy the wicked ones
Of attachment, hatred, and ignorance.
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-079-011-36}}}“Rain clouds are arrayed 
So that body and speech{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-079-011-351}}} may act for the welfare of{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-079-011-352}}} beings,
With divine pride in the two form buddha bodies
Endowed with great compassion. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-079-011-368,folio:F.188.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-079-011-37}}}“Inner and secret are the same.
Likewise, as for the ultimate, the fourth,
One should learn the oral tradition.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-079-011-38}}}“Then, inside, the celestial palace appears.
Bhruṁ creates an eight-spoked wheel.
The eight spokes stand for the eight consciousnesses.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-079-011-39}}}“The wheel transforms into the body of Vairocana.
Viewed from the outside, he is luminous inside.
Likewise, from inside out,
Meaning that all appears as one.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-079-011-40}}}“The five kinds of gems{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-079-011-353}}} symbolize the five buddha bodies.
The five colors indicate the five families.
The four corners are said to be the four pure abodes.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-079-011-41}}}“The four sides are the four means of magnetizing.
The four gates are the four foundations of mindfulness.
The eight pillars are the eight liberations.
The four beams symbolize the four gnoses.
All the gate adornments, and so forth,
Are said to be the powers and the like.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-079-011-42}}}“Then, as for the seats inside the palace, 
They are lotuses born from vowels as seed-syllables.
The lotus seat indicates not being stained
By the afflictions such as passion, and so forth.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-079-011-43}}}“The sun and moon atop the lotuses
Symbolize skillful means and wisdom.
The corpse is taught first 
For the destruction of the self, or conceptuality.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-079-011-44}}}“The four-featured seat of the central deity 
Is given as a seat to each member of the retinue,
Since they each are an aspect of the central deity.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-079-011-45}}}“That completes the supportive maṇḍala
Conjoined with its intended meaning.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-079-011-46}}}“Next, the deities are generated
According to the four types of birth.
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-079-011-47}}}“The miraculous manner is to arise instantaneously,
Like a fish jumping out of water.
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-079-011-48}}}“Birth from heat and moisture is to arise from conditions,
Like a lotus nurtured by the sun.
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-079-011-49}}}“Birth from an egg happens through projection and absorption,
Like copper produced from stone.
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-079-011-50}}}“Birth from a womb occurs from union,
Burned from above and formed from below,
Like a statue created from wax. {{note:{index21,id:UT22084-079-011-354}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-079-011-51}}}“Vairocana is completed with the palace.
Later, the Heruka is generated.
Conferring initiation is the Blessed One Akṣobhya.
Praise is Ratnasambhava.
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-079-011-52}}}“Offering is Amoghasiddhi.
Tasting ambrosia is Amitābha. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-079-011-369,folio:F.188.b}}}
The accomplishments that emerge 
From these six aspects are extraordinary.
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-079-011-53}}}“Then, concerning the recitation, or meditation,
There are those of superior, mediocre, and inferior faculties.
It is said that superior ones
Are to meditate, or recite in full.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-079-011-54}}}“The mediocre should focus on the central deity in father-mother union. 
The inferior are to apply themselves to the eyes of the central figure. 
Having reached stability on the eyes of the central figure,
They are to meditate on the thirty-seven features in full.
The mediocre are to do likewise.
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-079-011-55}}}“Located in the body are channels; circulating within them are winds; 
Mounted on these is the mind—the inferior practice involves shape;
The more profound involve mantra and seminal drops; 
And the ultimate involves dharma and the seven parts. 
Teaching this way is exceedingly profound.
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-079-011-56}}}“Everything taught above
Should also be understood as fourfold. 
Each one, moreover, is fourfold; 
The manifold manner is exceedingly profound.
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-079-011-57}}}“Outer and inner is the meaning of mantra.
The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning. 
Regarding the outer is the inner.
The secrecy of just that is the secret meaning.
Proficiency is the meaning of perfection.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-079-011-58}}}“The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning.
Inwardly, concerning the characteristics of the maṇḍala,
The aggregates, elements, and sense media 
Are each transformed into a deity, either five, six, or thirty-seven; 
Left, right, above, below, the gates, and so forth—
These should be understood from a master’s oral instructions.”
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-079-011-59}}}Then Vajragarbha asked:
“What is the completion 
Of the ‘thirty-seven’?
How are they ‘developed’?
What are their stages?
What is the supportive maṇḍala like?
And how are the sessions and breaks?
How are view and conduct united? 
Tell me, O Spiritual Hero!”
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-079-011-60}}}The Blessed One said:
“The thirty-seven, the pristine cause,
Give rise to nondual gnosis, the effect.
Therefore, the cause, which precedes the effect,
Is to become the principal deity.
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-079-011-61}}}“Even in just becoming the Heruka
All causes are complete;
The twenty-four locations and so forth
Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-079-011-62}}}“The effect does not come from a mistaken cause—
Barley does not sprout from a grain of wheat. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-079-011-370,folio:F.189.a}}}
Nor does it come from an incomplete cause—
There is no sprout from damaged grain—
Nor without a cause,
Like fragrance from a space flower.
The cause is not a cause without conditions,
Like a forest fire without wind.
The beginner thus endowed with these four parts
Will abandon concepts.
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-079-011-63}}} “Development is said to be done
By one who adheres to deity practice.
Multiple aspects, external and internal,
Are explained as its stages.
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-079-011-64}}}“The particular supportive maṇḍala
Is said to be of three types—
Without courtyard, without canopy, and with canopy—
According to inclination.
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-079-011-65}}}“Due to the divisions of the four chakras,
Daily sessions are taught as four.{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-079-011-355}}}
Breaks should also be understood to be four.
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-079-011-66}}}“It is taught that a practitioner who switches 
To twenty-two and a half minute hours and meditates in eight sessions
Equalizes sessions and breaks.
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-079-011-67}}}“During breaks, practitioners
Of mediocre and inferior faculties
Should project the deities in full
And properly perform offerings, and so forth,
Like one candle igniting another.
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-079-011-68}}} “View refers to equipoise;
 Subsequent attainment is explained as conduct.
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-079-011-69}}}“When practicing the development stage,
One is permitted to observe the conduct of wearing the six adornments.
In connection with the secret initiation,
One is allowed to observe the conduct of adornments and ambrosia.
I have said that those of the vajra family, the ratna family,
The padma family, and the karma family are permitted to observe the conduct.
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-079-011-70}}}“Those connected with the wisdom-gnosis initiation
Have in common what was taught above, and
In particular, are permitted to observe the conduct of the seal.
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-079-011-71}}}“With either conduct devoid of view, 
Or view devoid of conduct,
One transgresses the pledges of secret mantra
And takes birth as a hell-being in Endless Torment.
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-079-011-72}}}“Therefore, conduct devoid of view should be abandoned;
It is the conduct of a hostile demon.
Likewise, view devoid of conduct is also to be abandoned;
Tormenting the body through austerities {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-079-011-371,folio:F.189.b}}}
And despising the aggregates that are Vairocana and so forth
Is simply the work of a dry intellectual.
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-079-011-73}}}“Consequently, view and conduct are to be unified—
When an elephant rises, it rises all together,
And when an elephant sits, it sits all together.”
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-079-011-74}}}Vajragarbha then asked:
“What is meant by ‘ambrosia’?
What conduct is associated with it?
How do its qualities emerge?
Tell me, O Central Deity,
All the meanings of the adornments and the rest!”
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-079-011-75}}}The Blessed One replied:
 “Ambrosia is taught as threefold.
Firstly, one enjoys the outer ambrosia.
Arrange the five hooks
In the five ambrosias and the five meats. 
This should begin on the eighth and fourteenth days of the month.
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-079-011-76}}}“One should then gather silha wood, Akṣobhya, and dry manure.
This should begin on the twelfth and sixteenth days of the month.

The eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days 
Of the waxing and waning lunar periods 
Are taught as auspicious times for everything.

Its body and speech gentle and without any fault—
This is the basis for the formation of flesh.
As for ox, or elephant,
This should be the flesh of one from which musk and the like emerges
Based on the single material cause of it eating a ketaka flower.
Beef should be flesh that contains bile.
Horse meat should come from the king among horses,
Whose complexion is neither white nor red,
With flesh that neither changes shape nor color.
Human meat must be the flesh of a seventh-birth.
An adept should investigate his body, speech, and mind.
The food container should be a skull-cup in a single piece.
The ambrosia should be accomplished with the ingredients inside it.
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-079-011-79}}}“Superior, mediocre, and inferior signs— 
Blazing, wafting, and bubbling—
Are explained as pertaining to the external signs.
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-079-011-80}}}“Furthermore, the point of signs having arisen is that old age is eradicated. 
If sounds have not been heard there will be no accomplishment.
When sounds have issued forth one will become pure.

Having interrupted the flow of ambrosia dripping
From the nine orifices of the one with the bell,
It fills the body like sesame seeds. 
Then, as the breath enters the avadhūtī
The circulation of the upper sixth is elicited.
