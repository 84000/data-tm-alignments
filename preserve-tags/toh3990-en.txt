{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT23703-113-010-17}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT23703-113-010-57,folio:F.66.a}}} Homage to the youthful Mañjuśrī!
This sūtra explains that for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon four factors even at the cost of their lives. For what purpose was it undertaken? It was undertaken for the purpose of giving an explanation to those who have embarked upon the Great Vehicle and might be confused regarding how unsurpassable awakening should be attained. It was also undertaken for the purpose of encouraging the heedless to take proper care, motivating those who are thoroughly discouraged, and delighting those who have set out on the Great Vehicle.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT23703-113-010-21}}}The number four is used so that anyone who is intimidated by vastness will abandon any resistance to listening to the teaching. Using a number also facilitates memorization. Tolerance and gentleness, which appear toward the end, are not counted separately because they both have a single purpose.{{note:{index7,id:UT23703-113-010-22}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT23703-113-010-23}}}There are many ways of referring to those who have set out on the Great Vehicle, but here two names are specified.{{note:{index8,id:UT23703-113-010-24}}} There are three reasons for this, related to interest, practice, and comprehension. Because of their interest in profound objects of knowledge, they are referred to as bodhisattvas, and because of their interest in great power, they are referred to as great beings. How do these names relate to practice? Such beings strive intensely toward complete, perfect, and unsurpassable awakening for themselves, and they fully protect all sentient beings from suffering. How do these names relate to understanding? Awakening is realized through the two powers. What are these two? They are the power of intelligence and the power of diligence. Awakening cannot be realized where there is a lack of knowledge or through minimal effort.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT23703-113-010-25}}}The statement that these factors should not be relinquished for as long {{page:{number:2,id:UT23703-113-010-58,folio:F.66.b}}} as one lives is an indication that they should be continuously present. “Even at the cost of their lives” shows just how highly these factors are to be regarded. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT23703-113-010-26}}}What is the reason that there are said to be four factors? Is this not too few or too many? There are four factors that obstruct the accumulation of the supplies necessary for awakening, and these are four remedies for them. What are these four obstructive factors? They are (1) not seeking the goal, (2) not knowing the methods, (3) a lack of concern for sentient beings, and (4) concern for sense objects. The alternative set of four is (1) not getting started, (2) getting started in the wrong way, (3) quitting what one has started, and (4) becoming distracted after getting started. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT23703-113-010-27}}}Alternatively, there are four factors conducive to the accumulation of the supplies necessary for awakening, and these four factors constitute their foundation. What are the four factors conducive to the accumulation of the supplies necessary for awakening? They are (1) longing for instructions and guidance, (2) acquiring them, (3) being a worthy recipient of them, and (4) having accomplished them. The alternative set of four is (1) seeking the goal, (2) knowing the methods and then accomplishing them, with subdivision into (3) bringing sentient beings to maturity, and (4) developing the qualities of a buddha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT23703-113-010-28}}}Another set of four is (1) not abandoning saṃsāra, (2) remaining wholly undefiled by it, (3) attracting sentient beings, and (4) becoming purified through diligence. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT23703-113-010-29}}}Alternatively, four reasons one would travel a difficult path to traverse are (1) the wish to go, (2) knowledge of the path, (3) setting aside discouragement, and (4) heedfulness. It is through these that the path of samsara is traversed, and the four factors constitute their foundation. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT23703-113-010-30}}}Why are those who strive for the awakening of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas not called bodhisattvas? It is because the name applies only to the preeminent case, just as in the case of “the light-maker.”{{note:{index9,id:UT23703-113-010-31}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT23703-113-010-32}}}Put briefly, in this sūtra the Blessed One explains the actions that are appropriate for those who have embarked upon the Great Vehicle and how these actions will not fail to bear fruit.
