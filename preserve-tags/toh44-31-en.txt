{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-036-002-124}}}Then the Bhagavat was in the deva king Vaśavartin’s divine palace of precious jewels, together with a great saṅgha of bodhisattvas. They were all irreversible and one lifetime away from attaining the highest complete enlightenment. They had gathered there from various worlds. They dwelled in the attainment of the scope and range of the wisdom of all bodhisattvas. They maintained the range of activity that approaches and enters the scope of the wisdom of all tathāgatas.  They were skilled in manifesting at the proper moment in time all the activities of unimpeded blessings that would ripen and guide all beings. They had a range of activity that continually fulfilled the prayers of all bodhisattvas, and they continued in their conduct throughout eons, realms, and times. They had completed the accumulations of the merit, wisdom, and miraculous powers of all bodhisattvas, and they had unceasingly cared for all beings. They had attained the highest perfection of the wisdom and methods of all bodhisattvas. They had unceasing accomplishment of bodhisattva conduct, manifesting the doorways of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. They were skilled in manifesting all the activities that come from being adept in the dhyānas, liberations, samādhis, samāpattis, clairvoyances, and wisdom of all bodhisattvas. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-036-002-2002,folio:F.166.b}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-036-002-125}}}{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-036-002-126}}}{{note:{index23,id:UT22084-036-002-127}}}{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-036-002-128}}}{{note:{index25,id:UT22084-036-002-129}}}{{note:{index26,id:UT22084-036-002-131}}}

Without performing any action, they went in a mind’s instant to the assemblies of the followers of all tathāgatas as individuals who would be their foremost interlocutors. They maintained the Dharma wheels of all tathāgatas. They engaged in a multitude of offerings and acts of service to the buddhas. They manifested the appearance of bodies in all worlds and with equanimity engaged in undertaking the activities of all bodhisattvas. The unimpeded sound of their voices resounded throughout the entire realm of phenomena so that the three times were pervaded by the scope of the unimpeded wisdom of their minds.
