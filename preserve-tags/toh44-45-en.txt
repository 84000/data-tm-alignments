Some of them see a dry riverbed without water, and some of them see it filled with ashes. In that same way, although the sthaviras, the great śrāvakas, were present in Jetavana, their vision was obscured by the cataracts of the ignorance that is contrary to omniscience.

{{milestone:{label:54.1,id:UT22084-037-007-5143}}}Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, his mind moistened by the instructions of the kalyāṇamitra, contemplated bodhisattva conduct. Thinking of how his many bodies in the past had failed to practice perfect conduct, he made resolute the strength of his body. Thinking of how his body and mind throughout the past, even though pure, were the worthless continuation of a saṃsāric mind, he applied the attention of his mind to conduct. Thinking how his actions throughout the past had been impure, had been devoted to the world, and were worthless hardships, he contemplated accomplishing in the present that which is very meaningful.  Thinking how throughout the past he had developed thoughts through incorrect examination, he generated the strength to create the correct examination of bodhisattva conduct. Thinking how his past bodies had a range of activity dedicated to engaging in self-benefit, he made firm the strength of his superior, higher motivation to engage in benefiting all beings. Thinking how in the past he had the flavorless conduct of continually seeking what was desired, he increased the great force of the power for attaining relief through engaging in obtaining the Dharma of the buddhas. Thinking how in the past he had engaged in conduct through an incorrect motivation, he purified the flow of his mind in the present with a correct view that was free of error and with dedication to bodhisattva prayer. Thinking how in the past he fruitlessly had no diligence in his undertakings and practiced without diligence, in the present he motivated his mind and body by generating the diligence for remaining prepared to gather the Dharmas of the buddhas. Examining how he and others had been lost in the lower realms and the five classes of beings, and thinking how in the past he had not taken care of his body, he increased a vast, powerful rejoicing and aspiration for maintaining a body with the power to accomplish all the Dharmas of the buddhas, take care of all beings, and serve all kalyāṇamitras. {{page:{number:820,id:UT22084-037-007-8430,folio:F.289.a,volume:V38}}}{{page:{number:821,id:UT22084-037-007-8431,folio:F.289.b,volume:V38}}}{{note:{index1973,id:UT22084-037-007-5144}}}{{note:{index1974,id:UT22084-037-007-5145}}}{{note:{index1975,id:UT22084-037-007-5146}}}{{note:{index1976,id:UT22084-037-007-5147}}}
{{milestone:{label:54.2,id:UT22084-037-007-5148}}}He looked upon the body he had attained at that present time as the basis for illness, death, and misery, as a treasure that comes together and comes apart, and as the cause and condition for dedication to the practice of bodhisattva conduct until the last future kalpa; for dedication to ripening beings and possessing the Dharma of the buddhas; for dedication to seeing the tathāgatas, going to all realms, venerating all dharmabhāṇakas, and acquiring the teachings of all the tathāgatas; for help in the search for all Dharmas; for dedication to seeing all kalyāṇamitras and gathering all the Dharma of the buddhas; and for bodhisattva prayers and a body of wisdom.

{{milestone:{label:54.5,id:UT22084-037-007-5156}}}In the same way, he was empowered to be directly before all bodhisattvas, before the locations of all kalyāṇamitras, before all the caityas of the tathāgatas, before all the statues of the tathāgatas, before all the palaces of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, before all the locations of the precious Dharma, and before the locations and caityas of all śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas. He was continuously and directly present in all the gatherings of beings up to the gatherings of the āryas, in the places of offering, and before gurus and parents, through the way of undifferentiated wisdom bodies going everywhere with empowered perception and empowered by the mental activity of wisdom.

He was thus empowered continuously, throughout the future, by sameness with the extent of the measureless realm of space,  by sameness with the realm of phenomena without obscuration, by sameness with reaching the limits of existences, by sameness with the nonconceptual true nature, by sameness with the pervasion of shadow-like knowledge and perceptions, by sameness with dream-like analysis, by sameness with reflection-like perception of all worlds and beings, by sameness with echo-like origination from causes and conditions, by sameness with birthlessness, by sameness with origination and destruction, and by sameness with causes and conditions that have the same nature as nonexistence, so that he was aspiring to ripening that occurs in accordance with karma; aspiring to results that occur in accordance with causes; aspiring to all activities that arise in accordance with accumulations; aspiring to the arising of all tathāgatas, which occurs in accordance with faith; aspiring to the emanation of offerings to all buddhas, which occurs in accordance with aspiration; aspiring to the miraculous manifestations of all tathāgatas, which occur according to veneration; aspiring to the nature of all the buddhas, which occurs in accordance with the accumulation of roots of merit; aspiring to the accomplishment of displays, which occurs in accordance with method and wisdom; aspiring to the Dharmas of all buddhas, which occur according to prayer; aspiring to all bodhisattva conduct and its all-pervasive display of the accomplishment of the entire realm of phenomena as the field of perception of omniscience, which occur according to prayers of dedication, and with the wisdom of prayers of dedication, which is free from the conception of nothingness; with the wisdom of birthlessness, which is free from the conception of eternality; with the wisdom of entry into correct conduct and the accumulation of causes, which is free from false views concerning causes and actions; with the nonerroneous wisdom that is free from erroneous views; with the wisdom of nondependence, which is free from the view of independence; with the wisdom that understands dependence, which is free from the view of the concept of self and other; with the wisdom that enters the realm of phenomena that has no center or edge, which is free from the view that fixates on extremes; with the wisdom that accomplishes similarity to reflections, which is free from the view of the transference of skandhas; with the wisdom of there being neither creation nor cessation, which is free from the view of birth and destruction; with the wisdom of the birthlessness of emptiness, which is free of all views; with the strength of the wisdom that accomplishes prayers, which has the realization of the nature of phenomena as being devoid of independent existence; with the wisdom that has the gateway to the apex of the absence of characteristics, which is devoid of all characteristics; through the indestructible nature of phenomena that seedlings come from sprouts; through the nature of phenomena that a seal’s image is produced by a seal; through the nature of phenomena that a reflection comes from a visible form; through the nature of phenomena that an echo is perceived as being the same as a sound; through the nature of phenomena that analysis is perceived to be the same as a dream; through the nature of phenomena that the production of actions is the same as conjured illusions; through the nature of phenomena that the world is produced by the formless mind; through the nature of phenomena that results arise in accordance with the conditions and causes that have been accumulated; through the nature of phenomena that the ripening of results occurs in accordance with the karma that has been accumulated; through the nature of phenomena of manifestations through skill in methods; through the nature of phenomena of being moistened by the sameness of that which is Dharma and that which is not Dharma; and through the perception and mentation of the attainment of such an entry into wisdom, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed down and paid homage at the door of the great Vairocana­vyūhālaṃkāra­garbha kūṭāgāra. {{page:{number:824,id:UT22084-037-007-8434,folio:F.291.a,volume:V38}}}{{page:{number:825,id:UT22084-037-007-8435,folio:F.291.b,volume:V38}}}{{page:{number:826,id:UT22084-037-007-8436,folio:F.292.a,volume:V38}}}{{note:{index1982,id:UT22084-037-007-5158}}}{{note:{index1983,id:UT22084-037-007-5159}}}{{note:{index1984,id:UT22084-037-007-5160}}}{{note:{index1985,id:UT22084-037-007-5161}}}{{note:{index1986,id:UT22084-037-007-5162}}}{{note:{index1987,id:UT22084-037-007-5163}}}{{note:{index1988,id:UT22084-037-007-5164}}}{{note:{index1989,id:UT22084-037-007-5165}}}{{note:{index1990,id:UT22084-037-007-5166}}}{{note:{index1991,id:UT22084-037-007-5167}}}{{note:{index1992,id:UT22084-037-007-5168}}}{{note:{index1993,id:UT22084-037-007-5169}}}

In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw all the displays of miraculous manifestations because of the bodhisattva Maitreya’s engagement in inconceivable conjurations from blessing and wisdom. This was because of his accomplishment of the power of conjuration from the knowledge of all phenomena and because of conjuration through a bodhisattva’s power of blessing and wisdom.
{{milestone:{label:54.396,id:UT22084-037-007-5722}}}Then the bodhisattva Maitreya entered the kūṭāgāra and, diminishing those blessings, he snapped his fingers, saying to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Arise, noble one! Noble one, this is the nature of phenomena. This is the blessing of the wisdom of a bodhisattva. It is the characteristic of accomplishment from the practice of all Dharmas.  They thus have no existing nature of their own.

The bodhisattva Maitreya then said to him, “Noble one, you have seen the miraculous manifestations of the blessing of a bodhisattva. You have seen the power and natural result of the accumulations of a bodhisattva. You have seen accomplishments through the wisdom of the prayers of a bodhisattva. You have seen the delightful abodes of a bodhisattva. You have seen the accumulated conduct of a bodhisattva. You have heard the doors through which the bodhisattvas come forth. You have seen the immeasurable qualities and displays of the buddha realms. You have seen the specific different prayers of the tathāgatas.

Maitreya answered, “Noble one, this liberation is called the essence of the display of the unfailing memory that engages with the knowledge of all objects of perception in the three times.
{{milestone:{label:54.399,id:UT22084-037-007-5727}}}“Noble one, this kind of liberation, which is inexpressibly inexpressible, is the attainment of a bodhisattva with one lifetime remaining.” {{page:{number:922,id:UT22084-037-007-8532,folio:F.340.a,volume:V38}}}{{note:{index2155,id:UT22084-037-007-5728}}}

The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “It is where it comes from.”
{{milestone:{label:54.401,id:UT22084-037-007-5731}}}Sudhana asked, “Where does it come from?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “It comes from the accomplishment of the blessing of the wisdom of a bodhisattva. It dwells within that blessing. It does not come or go from anywhere. It does not accumulate. It does not come together. It does not amass. It has no location as a thing. It has no location as an object of perception. It has no location in any direction. 
{{milestone:{label:54.402,id:UT22084-037-007-5733}}}“By analogy, noble one, the net of clouds of the nāgas is not located in the body, is not located in the mind, is not located internally, and yet through the power of a nāga’s mind and through the inconceivable power of a nāga there is emitted a measureless flow of rain, which is not nonexistent and appears. In the same way, noble one, those displays are not located internally and are not located externally, but they become visible through the power of a bodhisattva’s blessing and through your being a good vessel.

{{milestone:{label:54.404,id:UT22084-037-007-5735}}}Sudhana asked, “Ārya, from how far have you come?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “Noble one, the movement of bodhisattvas has no coming or going;  their motion is without movement or stillness. Their motion is without basis or location. Their motion is without passing away or rebirth. Their motion is without remaining or going elsewhere. Their motion is without movement or rising. Their motion is without dependence or location. Their motion is without karma or its ripening. Their motion is without creation or cessation. Their motion is without permanence or annihilation.{{page:{number:923,id:UT22084-037-007-8533,folio:F.340.b,volume:V38}}}
{{milestone:{label:54.405,id:UT22084-037-007-5737}}}“Moreover, noble one, the motion of bodhisattvas is great compassion because it observes beings to be guided. The motion of bodhisattvas is great love because it saves beings from suffering. The motion of bodhisattvas is correct conduct because it regards everyone kindly. The motion of bodhisattvas is prayer because of the blessings of the past. The motion of bodhisattvas is higher cognition because it manifests itself to all. The motion of bodhisattvas has no formation, as there is no movement from being at the feet of all the tathāgatas. The motion of bodhisattvas has no acquisition or rejection, because it is not focused on a body or mind. The motion of bodhisattvas is wisdom and method because it follows all beings. The motion of bodhisattvas is the manifestation of emanations because it is like a mirage, a reflection, or an illusory manifestation. {{note:{index2156,id:UT22084-037-007-5738}}}{{note:{index2157,id:UT22084-037-007-5739}}}

In that pleasant, beautiful circle of the jinas,
And there obtain my prophecy
Directly from the Jina Amitābha. {59}

{{milestone:{label:c.2,id:UT22084-037-007-5972}}}A Multitude of Buddhas is the marvelous essence of the final, ultimate, definitive wheel from among the three wheels of the Sugata’s teaching. It has many other titles, such as The Mahāvaipulya Basket, The Earring, The Lotus Adornment, and so on. 
{{milestone:{label:c.3,id:UT22084-037-007-5973}}}It has seven sections:A Multitude of Tathāgatas,The Vajra Banner Dedication,The Teaching of the Ten Bhūmis,The Teaching of Completely Good Conduct,The Teaching of the Birth and Appearance of the Tathāgatas,The Transcendence of the World, and Stem Array. These are subdivided into forty-five chapters. {{page:{number:967,id:UT22084-037-007-8577,folio:F.362.b,volume:V38}}}{{note:{index2233,id:UT22084-037-007-5974}}}{{note:{index2234,id:UT22084-037-007-5975}}}{{note:{index2235,id:UT22084-037-007-5976}}}{{note:{index2236,id:UT22084-037-007-5977}}}{{note:{index2237,id:UT22084-037-007-5978}}}{{note:{index2238,id:UT22084-037-007-5979}}}{{note:{index2239,id:UT22084-037-007-5980}}}{{note:{index2240,id:UT22084-037-007-5981}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.4,id:UT22084-037-007-5982}}}According to Butön Rinpoché and others, it contains thirty-nine thousand and thirty verses, a hundred and thirty fascicles, and an additional thirty verses. In the Tshalpa Kangyur edition there are a hundred and fifteen fascicles, the Denkarma edition has a hundred and twenty-seven fascicles, and present-day editions have various numbers of fascicles.{{note:{index2241,id:UT22084-037-007-5983}}}{{note:{index2242,id:UT22084-037-007-5984}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.5,id:UT22084-037-007-5985}}}This sūtra was first received from Ārya Nāgārjuna by Paṇḍita Buddhabhadra and Paṇḍita Śikṣānanda (652–710), and they both translated it into Chinese. It is taught that Surendrabodhi and Vairocana­rakṣita became principal editors for a Chinese translation.
{{milestone:{label:c.6,id:UT22084-037-007-5986}}}As for the lineage of the text, there is the lineage from China: The perfect Buddha, Ārya Mañjuśrī, Lord Nāgārjuna, the two paṇḍitas mentioned above, and Heshang Tushun. Then the lineage continued through others until Üpa Sangyé Bum received it from Heshang Gying-ju. Then that lineage was passed on through Lotsawa Chokden and has continued up to the present time. 
{{milestone:{label:c.7,id:UT22084-037-007-5987}}}The lineage from India is as follows:
It was passed from Nāgārjuna to Āryadeva, and then Mañjuśrīkīrti, and so on, until Bari Lotsawa received it from Vajrāsana. It is taught that the lineage then continued through Chim Tsöndrü Sengé, the great Sakya Lord, and so on.{{note:{index2243,id:UT22084-037-007-5989}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.8,id:UT22084-037-007-5990}}}However, I have not seen any other text or history of a translation made by any other lotsawa or paṇḍita other than those listed in the colophon to this translation into Tibetan. 
{{milestone:{label:c.9,id:UT22084-037-007-5991}}}The king of Jangsa Tham had a complete Kangyur made that was based on the Tshalpa Kangyur. At the present time this is known as the Lithang Tshalpa Kangyur (1609–14). I considered this to be a reliable source and so have made it the basis for this edition. However, it has many omissions, accretions, and misspellings, and therefore I have at this time corrected it by seeking out many older editions. {{note:{index2244,id:UT22084-037-007-5992}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.10,id:UT22084-037-007-5993}}}There are variant Indian texts and conflicting translations, and I have not been able to ascertain from them a definitive single meaning or correct words. Nevertheless, this text is nothing but a valid edition. 
{{milestone:{label:c.11,id:UT22084-037-007-5994}}}There are varying translations of terms that have been left unrevised, as there is no contradiction in meaning. For example, it has rgyan instead of bkod pa;’byam klas instead of rab ’byams;so so yang dag par rig pa instead of tha dad pa yang dag par shes pa;thugs for dgongs pa;nyin mtshan dang zla ba yar kham mar kham dang instead of nyin mtshan dang yud du yan man dang; and tha snyad instead of rnam par dpyod pa.{{page:{number:968,id:UT22084-037-007-8578,folio:F.363.a,volume:V38}}}{{note:{index2245,id:UT22084-037-007-5995}}}{{note:{index2246,id:UT22084-037-007-5996}}}{{note:{index2247,id:UT22084-037-007-5997}}}{{note:{index2248,id:UT22084-037-007-5998}}}{{note:{index2249,id:UT22084-037-007-5999}}}{{note:{index2250,id:UT22084-037-007-6000}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.12,id:UT22084-037-007-6001}}}Sanskrit words have many cases and tenses, so that although the Tibetan lotsawas and paṇḍitas, who had the eyes of the Dharma, translated their meaning, their tenses, cases, and so on are difficult to discern. Those are the majority of the examples of uncertainty, and there are also a few other kinds, but they are nevertheless in accord with Tibetan grammar. 
{{milestone:{label:c.13,id:UT22084-037-007-6002}}}In most texts there are many archaic words, so that the meaning of the translation is not clear, but there is a consistency when those words are all in archaic Tibetan. However, there appears to have occurred in later times a strong adulteration of the text so that there is a mixture of archaic and modern forms. There are also unreliable placements of the shad mark that differentiates clauses, but all these have been left as they are because these faults are few and minor. Therefore, this revision has been diligently edited without becoming analogous to knocking down the ancient megaliths of the southern regions. 
{{milestone:{label:c.14,id:UT22084-037-007-6003}}}May this remain for the entire kalpa within the circle of the Cakravāla Mountains, as bright as the sun and moon, as the glory of the merit of nonsectarian beings and the precious teaching of the Buddha.
