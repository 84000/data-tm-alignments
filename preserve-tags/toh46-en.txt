{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-039-002-12}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Kalandakanivāpa, in the Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha, along with a great saṅgha of monks and innumerable bodhisattva great beings with only one birth remaining who had gathered from various buddhafields. At that time, the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma while surrounded by an audience numbering many hundreds of thousands. At one point, a bodhisattva named Anantavyūha, who was present among the assembly, stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Bowing with palms joined toward the Blessed One, he said, “If the Thus-Gone One will grant me the opportunity, I would like to ask the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha some questions, that I may receive a reply to my inquiries.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-039-002-13}}}The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva Anantavyūha, “Anantavyūha, you may ask the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha whatever you wish. My replies will bring satisfaction to your mind.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-039-002-14}}}The bodhisattva Anantavyūha then said to the Blessed One,  “Blessed One, I would like to ask several questions on behalf of bodhisattva great beings who cultivate boundless, immeasurable wisdom and don the great armor. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-039-002-472,folio:F.46.a}}}

Anantavyūha, you have asked the Thus-Gone One to resolve these matters for all bodhisattvas and out of compassion for all beings, to bring about the perfection of the bodhisattvas’ skill in means and the purification of their aspirations. The qualities that you possess are not easily achieved! Thus, Anantavyūha, listen carefully and pay attention.

How should they correctly resolve them? Anantavyūha, since this teaching of the Thus-Gone One emerges from the wisdom of the buddhas who are skilled in summarizing,  it does not arise from impurity. Anantavyūha, bodhisattvas should correctly train in this way: they should rely on the Dharma taught by the blessed buddhas, maintain great compassion, and extend great love to beings. In that way they will develop similar definitive qualities. {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-039-002-480,folio:F.50.a}}}

Other beings who are dedicated to what is inferior will reach the state of a pratyekabuddha. Beings who have made perfect great aspirations and are dedicated to what is vast will reach complete omniscient wisdom. We who have discarded lower, inferior teachings maintain this kind of dedication to the vast Dharma and come to understand the scope of the secret words that reveal the realization of the thus-gone ones. We properly adopt the entire Dharma through the vast, sublime, and incomparable syllables of the thus-gone ones’ Dharma teachings, so that beings may be brought to maturity in accordance with their faculties and inclinations.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-039-002-34}}}“All those Dharma teachings are equal, without anything added or left out. They are not formless but of equal form, they are beyond waning and fullness, and they are infinite, deathless, and inherently pure. Although the blessed buddhas perceive and realize precisely the essential nature of the Dharma that is taught, there is no Dharma whatsoever that they comprehend or realize. Why is that? Because all Dharma teachings  have been explained and taught contextually, and whatever is presented contextually transcends the superficial labels of Dharma and non-Dharma. All imputed phenomena are ultimately beyond imputation. The Thus-Gone One has taught how to endeavor correctly in the true reality of phenomena. Dharma and non-Dharma are not established through conceptualization or through the absence of conceptualization. Since all phenomena are conceptually equal, they are beyond conceptualization. Since all phenomena are comprehended distinctly, they are beyond distinction. Since all phenomena are beyond origination, they are unborn. Since all phenomena are identified and brought into being through inaccurate conceptualization, they are unreal. Since all phenomena must come into being, they are beyond arising. Because phenomena do not come into contact, they do not interact. Since all phenomena are the perfection of sameness, they are beyond dependence. Since there is no acceptance or rejection of any phenomena, they are beyond engagement; this is the unique fulfillment of the activity of aspiration. All phenomena lack identity, and because they transcend identity there is no concept of mine. Since all these phenomena are beyond elaboration, they are equal, without distinction. Even if qualities are accomplished just as one has aspired, there is no aspiration whatsoever. Since all these phenomena tend towards dependence, they are nothing whatsoever. For those reasons, the Thus-Gone One has taught the nature of all these phenomena to be like a dream or an illusion; with respect to the nature of different phenomena, there are not the slightest distinctions of better, middling, and worse. In order to benefit beings I, with pure aspirations,  have led them to form vast aspirations and give up fixation on any phenomena. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-039-002-481,folio:F.50.b}}}{{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-039-002-482,folio:F.51.a}}}{{note:{index3,id:UT22084-039-002-35}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-039-002-36}}}“Anantavyūha, this is the shining of the rays of the solar lineage; it is a Dharma illumination by which bodhisattvas’ unique and perfect aspirations flourish and excel. Therefore, the children of noble family who are devoted to this mode of Dharma teaching cultivate this light of the Dharma. Anantavyūha, bodhisattvas who reflect properly on an inward level while not letting their attention be distracted outwardly, who are stable in the abandonment of obscurations, who recollect the illumination of the bodhisattvas’ meditative absorption, and who are devoted to the profound Dharma should investigate this teaching. This teaching has been given by the Thus-Gone One to elicit expertise in what is conditioned. He has explained that those phenomena whose identity is to be conditioned are hollow, fake, void, essenceless, false, and deceptive by nature. The causes and conditions that make beings afflicted are also hollow, fake, void, essenceless, false, and deceptive. Even if you were to search throughout the worlds of the ten directions, you could never perceive or observe causes and conditions that lead beings to purity. These cannot be observed because they are beyond grasper and grasped and are nonexistent. If the Thus-Gone One has determined that phenomena are to be abandoned, what need is there to mention the abandonment of non-phenomena? What is abandoned is beyond being adopted; it is spontaneously present and intrinsically pure and thus does not know even the slightest existence. When all phenomena are comprehended precisely as they inherently are, there is no thinking or conceptualizing. Since all phenomena are not otherwise,  their basis cannot be identified. Therefore all these phenomena are groundless and baseless. They are verbal labels, and verbal labels are void. They persist without inherent identity, yet they do not persist. They are baseless, and because they have no basis they do not remain. The Thus-Gone One has taught using synonyms such as ending, transformation, and cessation. The Thus-Gone One’s intentional synonyms apply here as well. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-039-002-483,folio:F.51.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-039-002-37}}}“You should not fixate on either virtuous or nonvirtuous things. By fixating on nonvirtuous things one becomes fixated on nonvirtuous things. By fixating on nonvirtuous things, suffering and mental unease emerge. These are referred to as the noble truth of suffering and thus have been taught by the Thus-Gone One in the Dharma discourse on nonvirtue. In the Dharma discourse on virtue, the Thus-Gone One has taught the absence of fixation on both virtue and nonvirtue, as well as the cessation of craving, so that one may abandon the origin and realize the second noble truth. In order that one may reach cessation and be free from concepts, in the discourse on the third noble truth the Thus-Gone One has taught extinction, investigation into the state of freedom from attachment, and the absence of grasping, delight, perception, and sensation, as well as freedom from concepts, so that one may realize the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. In order that one may realize the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering, in the discourse of the fourth noble truth the Thus-Gone One has taught those paths concerned with the pursuit of the level of realization of phenomena just as they are, and he taught the state that utterly transcends concepts, deceit, and all conceptual elaboration. He also taught the presentation of the eightfold path from cultivation of the right view up to right concentration.  The blessed buddhas have categorized the suffering to be understood, its origin to be abandoned, the cessation to be actualized, and the path to be cultivated as suffering, its origin, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering. This suffering is a mere convention that does not really exist.{{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-039-002-484,folio:F.52.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-039-002-38}}}“There are the two bases for understanding ignorance and so forth. What are they? There is no basis whatsoever for the absence of knowledge; since it is beyond realization, experience, knowledge, and inclusion, what could its basis be? It is nonexistent, fake, false, and deceptive. It has no basis other than being a label. There is no basis for fixating on it as being something eternal or finite. This is how one should analyze the basis of suffering, without fixation on concepts. In that way, one should understand that without a basis there can also be no understanding. Since suffering arises in connection with ignorance, it has the nature of unknowing. Ignorance is neither associated nor unassociated with anything and thus is nonexistent; it is beyond association. For these reasons, ignorance is not referred to as a creator or considered to be one, and thus it does not think or conceptualize; it does not act or perform any function. {{note:{index4,id:UT22084-039-002-39}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-039-002-40}}}“Anantavyūha, this is the gateway to the comprehension of the identity of ignorance, which is aligned with the bodhisattvas’ knowledge and through which the darkness of ignorance is dispelled and the Dharma gateway that accords with knowledge is made manifest.  One purifies and accomplishes these gateways in order to realize expertise in the bodhisattvas’ noble truths. While focusing on suffering, one brings its origin to an end, to exhaustion, to cessation, by training in and cultivating the path of sameness. By practicing this path of sameness, one comes to know and understand all such phenomena. By knowing, one should abandon. By knowing, one should actualize. By knowing, one should cultivate. Thus what is known is understood, what is understood is abandoned, the abandonment is what is actualized, and what is actualized is taught to be cultivation. Understanding the Dharma of the noble ones in this way, one accomplishes the truth nonconceptually while remaining diligent; one remains free from acceptance and rejection. {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-039-002-485,folio:F.52.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-039-002-41}}}“Anantavyūha, noble beings understand that everything is imagined, created, and cherished, yet they do not become involved with concepts or conceptual elaboration, but maintain correct perception without clinging or reification. Thus they do not generate concepts or conceptual elaboration about the path, what is to be abandoned, or what is virtuous, not to mention concepts about what is nonvirtuous! If they are not caught up in the abandonment of these, why mention the abandonment of non-Dharma in a nonconceptual way? Those who are skilled in abandoning fetters neither bind themselves to what is spiritual nor to what is non-spiritual. They know that all phenomena are false, deceptive, void, hollow, and fake, and thus they have realized their true nature. Because they have perfected equanimity, abandoned fetters, and follow the path,  and because beings are bound to die, they spurn attachment and anger, and they realize that the essence of reality is neither to be accepted nor rejected. {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-039-002-486,folio:F.53.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-039-002-42}}}“In any case, Anantavyūha, since it is the inherent identity of phenomena to be intrinsically empty, all phenomena lack inherent identity, and therefore no creator of phenomena can be apprehended. Since the fetters are not present in any phenomena, one can neither associate with them nor disassociate from them. Thus one should not fixate even on the unreal or form ideas and concepts about abandoning the real and unreal. Through understanding of the purity of conditions, one knows that because any phenomena produced by conditions are empty of the conditions through which they arise, and vice versa, and because beings lack inherent identity, they are utterly pure and disengaged. Therefore, conditions are not associated with causes, and causes are not associated with conditions. No phenomena impel or become involved with each other, and so, Anantavyūha, focusing on inactive phenomena, one should penetrate this Dharma gateway of groundlessness.

Characteristics refers to the labeling of the four elements as form, while names refers to the labeling of the remaining four aggregates as other than form. Names are false imputations, and due to the inaccurate distortion of characteristics, the self is considered a type of form,  while the body is held to belong to the self. Names are given due to the conceptualization of characteristics. Name and form are entirely unreal: they are fake, false, deceptive, illusory, and similar to forms in a dream. Forms are explained to be just like the physical bodies experienced in a dream. One should understand that forms, which lack essence, and the remaining four aggregates grouped under name, are all mere conventions. If one can understand that, one will not be affected by suffering, nor will one grasp at truth. Nothing whatsoever will be held in one’s mind; nothing will be apprehended, not even the slightest sense of having passed beyond suffering.

Since the mental activity of perception is nonexistent, those born in the three realms are also taught to be nonexistent. Whenever there is comprehension, there is fixation on form. Any mental activity is explained to be associated with sensation, perception, formation, and consciousness. Since it is the nature of phenomena to be neither associated nor disassociated, the mental activity of perception is nonexistent. Since the mental activity of perception is inherently nonexistent, it is labeled with words while being nonexistent; it is categorized as inherently peaceful.

You should form an immense resolve,  engage with the Dharma teachings, and engender great love and compassion for beings while free of fixation, concepts, conceptual elaboration of phenomena, or any sense that there are beings. This is how you should enter, traverse, and resolve these Dharma gateways. Which Dharma gateways? One realizes that all conditioned things arise out of unknowing and that all unconditioned things arise from wisdom vision. With wisdom free of conceptual elaboration, one should then correctly engage with and purify both the conditioned and the unconditioned. As one proceeds to apply the uncountable Dharma teachings, the enumerations have no enumeration; enumerations have no basis in enumerations. Since the gateway to the unconditioned is a Dharma gateway, it is utterly pure and leads to the apprehending of all the aspects of the Dharma illumination. Without letting what has been grasped and apprehended go to waste, one describes and teaches it with a mind that has achieved skill in means. {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-039-002-488,folio:F.54.a}}}

Anantavyūha, what is the Dharma section of the dhāraṇī gateway through which bodhisattvas become skilled in apprehending all phenomena? Anantavyūha, a bodhisattva with expertise in pure wisdom maintains the wisdom of eloquence and looks into the intrinsic identity of phenomena with a mind that accords with the meaning. The bodhisattva then teaches, using the words of guidance, to describe the inexpressible: that all phenomena are essentially groundless, nameless, signless, unequaled, and beyond concordance, and yet they are not formless.  The nature of phenomena is undefinable, beyond coming and going, and beyond letters; it is the purity of letters, spontaneously present. Why is that? Because the nature of phenomena is similar and comparable to space. All things are therefore false and lack establishment; like space, they cannot be characterized by analysis and expression; they are utterly pure. {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-039-002-489,folio:F.54.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-039-002-50}}}“All these phenomena constitute a gateless gate; their gateway is completely pure, as they are unafflicted and undisturbed. How so? The nature of all things is utterly unborn and unformed because the identity of phenomena is beyond birth and formation. For this reason, all these phenomena are described and defined as having the intrinsic identity of being unreal; their nature is to have the intrinsic identity of being unreal. In that way, if one does not fixate on them, then the bodhisattvas’ Dharma gateway that is beyond fixation, the dhāraṇī gateway, and the gateway of Dharma sections become completely pure. When discussing the features of any phenomenon, we speak conventionally about ‘such-and-such features.’ Yet whatever is a feature is devoid of features, thus features are beyond actions, deeds, attachment, and anger. For this reason the gateway of purity is explained to be a non-gateway. Because that pure gateway is an immaculate gateway that engages with the absence of features, a feature is thus explained to be not truly existent. In the same way it is explained, for the purpose of recognizing ignorance, as being unformed and devoid of features. Anantavyūha, this gateway is the purification of dhāraṇī. Anantavyūha, gateway is the realization that all phenomena are like a gate of space and, like a gate of space, are beyond appearances. Within that realization, one understands the sameness of everything that arises and disintegrates. All those phenomena should therefore be apprehended in a way that transcends realization, disappearance, and apprehending. {{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-039-002-490,folio:F.55.a}}}

Anantavyūha, absence of features refers to that which is devoid of both a body and something labeled as a body. The absence of features refers to that which is devoid of both an assemblage of names and something labeled by an assemblage of words. The absence of features implies that one should meditate in a space-like manner and understand the truth to be like space. Space is devoid of space, and space is therefore a label formed by an assemblage of words. This is the Dharma section of the gateway to the production of the power of wisdom knowledge, which concords with ignorance and by which a bodhisattva comes to realize expertise in the way of dhāraṇī. Since it is to be upheld, and since it is indisputable and free of delusion, one should penetrate the meaning of the secret dhāraṇī words, which are uninterrupted like the rains and rivers unleashed by the nāga king Anavatapta.

The bodhisattva Anantavyūha replied to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, dhāraṇī is a term that refers to knowledge of the connections between phenomena. Blessed One, dhāraṇī means to maintain the act of recollection. They are called dhāraṇī because they teach the bases of secret words that maintain the power of the treasure of insight. . In this way, I will uphold the infinite power of awakening with a mind that utilizes expertise in wisdom. Blessed One, in order to help all beings, I will generate the stream of the Dharma as well as an uninterrupted power of expertise in revealing infinite wisdom. Blessed One, this dhāraṇī gateway is as wide as the sky; it is an unequaled great gateway. For that reason, it is defined as immeasurable and limitless. Statements such as equality of expression, facilitation, and instruction refer to its categorization in terms of expertise in teaching and its uniqueness. Since distinctions among letters are mastered, the comprehensive knowledge of language will be mastered. Since the meaning is analyzed and there is skill in teaching, comprehensive knowledge of the meaning will be mastered. Since there is skill in ascertaining phenomena, the comprehensive knowledge of phenomena will be mastered. Since there is purity of eloquence in the gateways of the Dharma, comprehensive knowledge of eloquence will be mastered. One fosters and maintains great love and great compassion in order to help beings, and yet one displays equanimity free of conceptual elaboration, without any sense of knowing or teaching others. Blessed One, these Dharma sections—expertise in limitless topics and expertise in the dhāraṇī gateway—came from the mouth of the Thus-Gone One.” {{page:{number:21,id:UT22084-039-002-491,folio:F.55.b}}}

Anantavyūha, these Dharma teachings are taught and articulated from the gateway of the Thus-Gone One’s utterly pure wisdom vision. They are based in the infinite pure gateways, are baseless, and manifest baselessly in the apprehending of numerous phenomena. Anantavyūha, I have stated that ‘all phenomena are the Buddha’s Dharma,’ which means that when there is realization of all phenomena, it is called the Buddha’s Dharma. In other words, these phenomena are the Buddha’s Dharma because the nature of all phenomena has been realized to be equal through awakened wisdom. The expression comprehension of all phenomena is used because all phenomena must be realized, and the realization of all phenomena is the realization of the dhāraṇī gateway because it subsumes all phenomena. Anantavyūha, these dhāraṇīs are the condensation, the inclusion, the main essence, and the heart of every explanation, praise, utterance, declaration, and illustration. All praises, explanations, and illustrations are articulated, described, and illuminated through the knowledge of letters. {{page:{number:22,id:UT22084-039-002-492,folio:F.56.a}}}{{note:{index7,id:UT22084-039-002-55}}}

After that, all the different appendages, the various sense sources, the various faculties, and the various shapes of the fully-matured faculties  can form in their entirety. Similarly, everything that is distinguishable is preceded by syllables. Here, the syllable a is positioned in proximity to the consonants at the beginning while ha is the last. These subsume the other letters, which follow after and join with them.

For instance, the combination of kha and yang shows that everything subsumed within the category of karmic formations—which pertains to the link of existence—is shown to be exhausted insofar as it perishes in the same way that one stops studying the alphabet once it has been mastered. For example, just as possession implies both cessation and dependence, so does everything related to both having what is associated with the fetters of existence and having what is subsumed within existence. Thus one should analyze all phenomena associated with the real and unreal, until in the end one has purified the gateway of the unformed. This is the entrance to the Dharma gateway that shows birth and destruction, and it is the explanation of the section of the dhāraṇī gateway that perfects the bodhisattvas’ skill in means. In this way, one should pronounce the first letter of the alphabet, progressing through ḍha and on until one masters the pronunciation of ha, thereby penetrating the meaning of secret mantra by means of explanation and correct articulation.

One would then see that there is no letter that can be designated apart from these. The accomplishment of nondual attention with regard to everything in the category of the aggregate of formation is similar to this. Anantavyūha, for someone free of dualistic concepts, there is ultimately nothing at all that can be designated as a letter, nor are there any concepts from the perspective of fundamental reality. For someone without concepts, there is nothing at all that can be labeled as formation. Anantavyūha, to understand all phenomena is to maintain the knowledge of letters; because letters are uncreated they are beyond features. Why is this? Because there is no a that is truly brought about, and one should regard everything that is conditioned as lacking features. Since they are uncompounded, one should also abandon all aggregates. {{page:{number:24,id:UT22084-039-002-494,folio:F.57.a}}}

Abandoning mental involvement with conceptual notions, they will take birth out of love for sentient beings. In order to become skilled in resolving their understanding of the unexcelled Dharma, they will mentally disperse the light of the Dharma and recollect the Thus-Gone One’s treasury of teachings. In order to comprehend the Dharma, they will achieve expertise in the infinite ways of mental understanding.

Thus all phenomena are taught to be emptiness; whatever is empty is signless, and whatever is signless is wishless and beyond comprehension.

There is no misfortune that may beset phenomena; their fortune is not damaged or ruined. There is no disparity between the fortunes of any phenomena. They are neither identical nor different but are of the highest perfection, even though there are no phenomena that are the perfection of any other. Because they are all nirvāṇa, they are not to be described, except when teaching on a relative level to present the middle way. The middle way is the path leading to nirvāṇa, but nirvāṇa does not involve going anywhere.
