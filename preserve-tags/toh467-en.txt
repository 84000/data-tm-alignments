{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-083-015-88}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavat was dwelling in the bhagas of all vajra women, who are the essence of the body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas. He was there with Yamāri’s large assembly, which included Yamāri Mohavajra, Yamāri Piśunavajra, Yamāri Rāgavajra, Yamāri Īrṣyāvajra, Yamāri Dveṣavajra, Mudgara Yamāri, Daṇḍa Yamāri, Padma Yamāri, Khaḍga Yamāri, and, standing in the four intermediate directions, Vajracarcikā, Vajravārāhī, Vajrasarasvatī, and Vajragaurī. Then, Vajrapāṇi supplicated the Bhagavat,{{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-083-015-89}}} the vajra-being,{{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-083-015-90}}} the lord of all tathāgatas, prompting the Bhagavat, the lord of all tathāgatas, to emerge from the meditative absorption called the vajra that conquers all māras, the state of his own vajra body, speech, and mind. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-083-015-91}}}“In order to pacify the māras

One should visualize Yama’s Slayer
