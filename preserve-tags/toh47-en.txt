Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha together with a great monastic assembly of forty-two thousand monks, as well as eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas of great courage, who were well known on account of their fame, a great many of whom had come from other buddha domains. All of them had attained the state of acceptance.{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-039-003-151}}} They could not be turned back. They were limited to only one more life. They had acquired a powerful memory and the formulas that support it. They had acquired states of meditative concentration. Their inspired eloquence was without impediment. They were adept at traveling to limitless buddha domains throughout the ten directions. They had made child’s play of the forms of knowledge including the supernormal faculties.{{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-039-003-152}}} They were undefeated in argument by any and all proponents of rival doctrines. They had vanquished their adversaries and Māra in all his forms.{{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-039-003-153}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-039-003-154}}}They knew the outcome of the conduct, motivations, and intentions of all beings. They were skilled in knowing their faculties to be of a greater or lesser caliber. They had gained access to the guiding principles of all the perfections. They had reached perfection of the most perfect mastery of skill in means. They were praised, lauded, and extolled by all the buddhas.{{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-039-003-155}}} They had come to the end of the endless path to awakening, which spans countless trillions of eons. Their minds were like earth, water, wind, and fire.{{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-039-003-156}}}{{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-039-003-1854,folio:F.100.b}}} They were fully engaged in a practice of the meditation on love that was limitless like space. They had risen above being disturbed, carried away, or overwhelmed by any object of attachment. They had obtained the body of a Nārāyaṇa. Their bodies were rock-solid and unbreakable as vajra.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-039-003-157}}}They roared the great lion’s roar. They had mastered the self-assurance needed to stand out in every assembly.{{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-039-003-158}}} They outshone the sun and moon.{{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-039-003-159}}} They had attained the understanding that in reality all things are the same across the three times.{{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-039-003-160}}} They were adept at giving instructions with knowledge of the profound exegesis of the Dharma.{{note:{index:40,id:UT22084-039-003-161}}} By comprehending dependent arising they had abandoned the two extremes—the views that things are eternal and that they come to a complete end. They were adept at bringing about the emergence and stabilization of the meditations, the liberations, the concentrations, and the absorptions. Their voices resounded throughout the ten directions. They were in full possession of the treasury of jewels of the true Dharma. They made sure the lineage of the Three Jewels remained unbroken.{{note:{index:41,id:UT22084-039-003-162}}} They were fully equipped with a truly endless supply of merit and knowledge.

The asura lords, such as Rāhu, Vemacitra, Subāhu, Sāla, Tāla, Śambara, Prahlāda, and The Huge One, as well as other yakṣas and asura lords and their retinues, had also joined the assembly to see the Blessed One, to honor him, to worship him, to serve him, and to hear the Dharma. King Ajātaśatru, the women from the king’s inner chambers, and his relatives had also joined the assembly to see the Blessed One, to honor him, to worship him, to serve him, and to hear the Dharma. Moreover, the fourfold assembly of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen had also joined the assembly to see the Blessed One, to honor him, to worship him, to serve him, and to hear the Dharma. The gods who live in the sky, along with the gods from the realms of desire and form, as well as those gods from the pure abodes had also joined the assembly to see the Blessed One, to honor him, to worship him, to serve him, and to hear the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-039-003-166}}}On that occasion, surrounded by and at the head of an assembly of countless hundreds of thousands, the Blessed One taught the Dharma on the collection of gateways into the purity of the supplies of the bodhisattvas of great courage so that they could completely fill their stores. This is what he said:
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-039-003-167}}}“The bodhisattvas’ supply of generosity serves the purpose of bringing beings to maturity. The bodhisattvas’ supply of moral conduct serves the purpose of fulfilling their vows. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-039-003-1857,folio:F.102.a}}} The bodhisattvas’ supply of patience serves the purpose of acquiring the major and minor marks of a great person.

The bodhisattvas’ supply of merit serves the purpose of sustaining all beings.{{note:{index:44,id:UT22084-039-003-170}}} The bodhisattvas’ supply of knowledge serves the purpose of removing impediments to their knowledge. The bodhisattvas’ supply of calm abiding serves the purpose of making the mind ready for any endeavor. The bodhisattvas’ supply of deep insight serves the purpose of becoming free from doubt. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-039-003-171}}}“The bodhisattvas’ supply of love serves the purpose of ridding the mind of malice.

Their supply of intelligence serves the purpose of developing a discerning mind. Their supply of comprehension serves the purpose of enabling them to conform with their comprehension of the true meaning. Their supply of the applications of mindfulness serves the purpose of carefully observing the body, feelings, mind, and mental objects. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-039-003-1858,folio:F.102.b}}} Their supply of right effort serves the purpose of ridding themselves of all vicious qualities and filling up their reserves of all virtuous qualities.
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-039-003-173}}}“Their supply of the foundations for superhuman power serves the purpose of making the body and mind agile.{{note:{index:45,id:UT22084-039-003-174}}} Their supply of the five spiritual faculties serves the purpose of knowing beings’ faculties to be of a greater or lesser caliber. Their supply of the five powers serves the purpose of not being crushed under the weight of all the afflictions. Their supply of the constitutive factors of awakening serves the purpose of becoming awake to the true nature of all things.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-039-003-175}}}“Their supply of the path serves the purpose of going beyond all bad paths.

{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-039-003-178}}}Thus the Blessed One gave to the bodhisattvas of great courage a detailed formulation of the Dharma known as the collection of gateways into the purity of the supplies. 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-039-003-179}}}As the Blessed One was giving this teaching, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, was seated on his right-hand side while holding up his vajra. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-039-003-1859,folio:F.103.a}}} When the Blessed One had finished, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, said to him, “It is marvelous, Blessed One, how well the Realized One has expressed this formulation of the Dharma on the collection of gateways into the purity of the supplies of the bodhisattvas of great courage. If I were to state what I understood to be the import of the Blessed One’s words, then, Blessed One, I would say that all the supplies of the bodhisattvas of great courage are subsumed within the supplies of merit and knowledge, and can be accessed in this way.
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-039-003-180}}}“The reason for this, Blessed One, is that the supply of merit of bodhisattvas of great courage provides a foundation for all their accomplishments, and their supply of knowledge makes all beings satisfied with what has been well said. Therefore, Blessed One, bodhisattvas of great courage should make efforts to acquire the supplies of merit and knowledge.{{note:{index:47,id:UT22084-039-003-181}}} The reason for this, Blessed One, is that the supply of merit brings to completion the perfection that is the bodhisattvas’ mastery of skill in means. The supply of knowledge brings to completion their perfection of wisdom. These two paths of the bodhisattvas’ conduct serve the purpose of bringing together all paths.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-039-003-182}}}“A bodhisattva who is on the path is difficult for the evil Māra to defeat, and the bodhisattva who has stepped beyond the path of Māra cannot be turned back from unsurpassable and perfect awakening. To such an irreversible bodhisattva, the blessed buddhas teach the secrets of the realized ones without concealing anything.”
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-039-003-183}}}Then the bodhisattva Śāntamati said to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-039-003-1860,folio:F.103.b}}} “Lord of the Guhyakas, you have been a close attendant and constant companion of the Realized One.{{note:{index:48,id:UT22084-039-003-184}}} Lord of the Guhyakas, the places containing the secrets of the realized ones are not within the purview of the disciples or the solitary buddhas, so what need is there to speak of their being within the purview of ordinary beings either. Would you please use your inspired eloquence to shine light on them for us?”{{note:{index:49,id:UT22084-039-003-185}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-039-003-186}}}When this was said, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, remained silent. So the bodhisattva Śāntamati, understanding that Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, was going to remain silent, spoke to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, would you please encourage Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, to give a teaching here in the assembly about the secrets of the realized ones? If the bodhisattvas of great courage could hear such a teaching, they would be delighted and they would work to acquire the constitutive factors of awakening and become diligent in the practice of perfecting the secrets of the realized ones.”
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-039-003-187}}}The Blessed One then said to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, “Lord of the Guhyakas, the assembly wishes to hear about the secrets of the bodhisattvas and the secrets of the realized ones. Therefore, I request you to use your inspired eloquence to shine light on the secrets of the realized ones for this assembly.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-039-003-188}}}Vajrapāṇi replied to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will give a teaching about the secrets of the bodhisattvas and the secrets of the realized ones to whatever small degree that I have understood them, and this much through the majestic power and the empowering authority of the Buddha. Indeed, Blessed One, just as the empowering authority of a lamp can make all forms visible in the darkest depths of night, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-039-003-1861,folio:F.104.a}}} in that same way, Blessed One, through the majestic power and empowering authority of the Buddha, I will explain the secrets of the bodhisattvas and the secrets of the realized ones according to the small degree that I have understood them.”{{note:{index:50,id:UT22084-039-003-189}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-039-003-190}}}Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, then said to the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati, “Noble son, make sure that when you hear about the secrets of the bodhisattvas and realized ones, you do not become frightened, afraid, or terrified, and that you remain properly seated in the assembly.”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-039-003-191}}}Then the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati, said to the entire assembly, “Friends, the Realized One has spoken of four mysteries. They are the mystery of action, the mystery of speech, the mystery of concentration, and the mystery of a buddha. Furthermore, friends, after having awakened to unsurpassable and perfect awakening, the Buddha set forth these four mysteries. Among these four, he has taught that the mystery of a realized one is the foremost. Friends, when you hear of the mystery of a bodhisattva and the mystery of a realized one, do not become frightened, afraid, or terrified.{{note:{index:51,id:UT22084-039-003-192}}} Instead, when you hear of them, you should generate an abundance of pleasure, serene faith, and great joy.”
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-039-003-193}}}This statement by the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati, made the entire assembly eager to hear about the secrets of the realized ones, and in order to empower the assembly with empowering authority he then scattered heavenly flowers among the retinue until they covered the ground up to everyone’s knees.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-039-003-194}}}Then Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, spoke to the bodhisattva {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-039-003-1862,folio:F.104.b}}} of great courage, Śāntamati: “In that case, Śāntamati, listen well and pay close attention. I will now explain the secret places of the bodhisattvas. Śāntamati, I have served as the Realized One’s close attendant from the time when he, as a bodhisattva, received the prediction of his future unsurpassable and perfect awakening from the realized one, the blessed Dīpaṃkara. Since that time, I never witnessed any alteration of the bodhisattva’s body or any physical artifice whatsoever.{{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-039-003-195}}} I never heard any alteration of the bodhisattva’s speech or any flattery either. I never witnessed any alteration of the bodhisattva’s mind or any dissimulation either. He brought beings to maturity with his body and the demeanor of his body, and thus he did not speak at all. In order to bring beings to maturity, his bodily demeanor manifested itself infinitely and endlessly. 
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-039-003-196}}}“Śāntamati, the bodhisattvas’ bodily demeanor conforms to the bodily demeanor of all beings, spontaneously and effortlessly. For example, to beings who need to be guided by concentration, they show the conduct of concentration. To beings who need to be guided through playing stringed instruments and singing songs, they show the conduct of playing stringed instruments and singing songs.

To beings who need to be guided by those who are elderly, they show the conduct of the elderly. 
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-039-003-197}}}“To beings who need to be guided by those whose limbs are deformed or missing, they show the conduct of those whose limbs are deformed or missing. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-039-003-1863,folio:F.105.a}}} To beings who need to be guided by untouchables whose hands or feet have been cut off, they show the conduct of untouchables whose hands or feet have been cut off. To beings who need to be guided by those who are mentally or physical disabled, they show the conduct of the mentally and physically disabled. To beings who need to be guided by the blind and deaf, they show the conduct of the blind and deaf. 
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-039-003-198}}}“To beings who need to be guided by the appearance of hell beings, they show the conduct of hell beings. To beings who need to be guided by beings in the animal realm, or those in the realm of Yama, or by human beings, they show the conduct of beings in the animal realm, or those in the realm of Yama, or human beings. To beings who need to be guided by gods, they show the conduct of gods. To beings who need to be guided by nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, or mahoragas, they show the conduct of nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas.

However, none of that applies to beings in the formless realm.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-039-003-199}}}“Śāntamati, in this manner the bodhisattvas’ physical appearance, caste, and demeanor conform spontaneously and involuntarily to the physical appearance, caste, and demeanor of all beings. In this respect, even though bodhisattvas, who do not form concepts and are in a state of equanimity, display their physical demeanors with their bodies, they do not deviate from the true nature of the body.{{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-039-003-200}}} Although they perform physical actions with their bodies, they do not lose sight of the separateness of the body. They bring joy to all hell beings with the radiance of their bodies brought about by the purification of their bodies. With no concern for their bodies, they offer their own flesh to satisfy carnivorous beings who desire meat for sustenance. They do so despite the fact that in giving their flesh to such beings they give up their lives in the process. They give their blood to those who drink blood, their bones to those who devour bones, and their physical vitality to those who consume the body’s vitality.{{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-039-003-201}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-039-003-202}}}“Śāntamati, they nourish all beings with whatever kind of bodily nourishment they require, and do so from their own bodies, even at the cost of their lives. The infinitude of their bodies is not exhausted because it proceeds from the infinite nature of the realm of reality. Their realization of inexhaustible bodies arises because they are well acquainted with the realization of the inexhaustible nature of dependent origination. They bring beings to maturity with their bodies. 
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-039-003-203}}}“In front of beings who actively pursue sense pleasures, who are attached to the signs and images of beauty, they appear as well-formed, beautiful, and attractive female bodies. When these beings become inflamed with passion, they caress them, massage them with oil, and sit on their laps. Then, as they are sitting on these men’s laps, they wither and decay. They become putrid and foul-smelling corpses so that those men become disenchanted and push them aside, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-039-003-1865,folio:F.106.a}}} but then the teaching of the Dharma issues from those corpses in such a way that those men become impossible to turn back from unsurpassable and perfect awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-039-003-204}}}“Furthermore, Śāntamati, such bodhisattvas can pervade this cosmos of a billion worlds with their body. They can cover it with a jeweled parasol or even with their finger just like someone can cover a mustard seed with a fingertip.{{note:{index:55,id:UT22084-039-003-205}}} Even if their finger were to cover the fire that consumes the cosmos at the end of a cosmic age, their body would not be harmed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-039-003-206}}}“With their bodies, they worship and serve the blessed buddhas. In the act of worshiping the realized ones, they offer flowered parasols and baskets of flowers as large as Mount Meru.{{note:{index:56,id:UT22084-039-003-207}}} In the act of worshiping the realized ones, they light a lamp with this cosmos of a billion worlds as the vessel filled with fragrant oil and a blazing wick the size of Mount Meru. In the act of worshiping the realized ones, they light as many lamps as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. In the act of worshiping the realized ones, they wrap their very own bodies in linen cloth soaked with oil and clarified butter, and then they set it aflame, and when they are blazing, the fire emits a great light that pervades as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. Beings see it and recognize it, and when they see the majesty of such bodhisattvas, immeasurable, countless numbers of beings conceive the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-039-003-208}}}“To beings made haughty by pride, conceit, and arrogance, these bodhisattvas make themselves appear in the form of Vajrapāṇi, a Nārāyaṇa, or a being with a great physique. These arrogant beings become terrified of bodhisattvas who appear in this way, and they bow and prostrate themselves before them. Then they wish to hear the Dharma from them.

The beings from the animal realm staying there feast on their flesh as much as they please, and then at the end of their lives, when their time comes to die, they are reborn among the gods of the higher realms and good places of rebirth. These bodhisattvas also become the cause of these beings’ eventual cessation, because of the purification of the previous vows of these bodhisattvas. They have long ago formed the vow that if, when they die, beings feast on their dead bodies and this becomes the cause for them to be reborn in the higher realms until they pass beyond anguish, then, for those who have maintained moral conduct, they achieve their aspiration, they accomplish their desire, they fulfill their vow.{{note:{index:57,id:UT22084-039-003-210}}}

At that moment and time, Śāntamati, there occurred a lengthy period of great pestilence. Most beings there were afflicted as various diseases spread: diseases of the body’s air, heat, and phlegm,{{note:{index:59,id:UT22084-039-003-213}}} resulting in symptoms like pus-filled boils, lesions, scabs, rashes, and blisters. Many thousands of doctors labored to relieve the symptoms of these beings, but they were unable to cure them of the disease. As no cure could be found for these beings, and they were without any protection or refuge, they gave a great cry:

With his pure divine hearing surpassing that of ordinary human beings, he heard the sound of their great cries. When he saw and heard them, he developed tremendous compassion. He thought, ‘I must help these helpless beings. I must protect and support these weak and defenseless beings.’ Right then and there in the center of Jambudvīpa, not far from the great city of Kuru, he spontaneously appeared as a creature by the name of Saumya, and the following verses offering encouragement to all the people of Jambudvīpa came from the sky:

Whatever they cut away simply grew back, and, Śāntamati, all persons who consumed the flesh from the creature Saumya found their symptoms alleviated immediately upon doing so.

They were delighted by the instruction in the Dharma given by Śakra, Lord of the Gods. They took it completely to heart and felt truly encouraged by it. Some of them conceived the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening. Some of them purified the spotless and immaculate Dharma eye in regard to things.

{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-039-003-229}}}Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, then spoke further to the bodhisattva Śāntamati: “The body of a bodhisattva is unbreakable, Śāntamati; it is rock-solid, strong, not subject to change, and it arises spontaneously. This body disintegrates for the sake of guiding beings who need to be guided by its disintegration. This body stays whole for the sake of guiding beings who need to be guided by its wholeness. It cannot be burned by fire or pierced by weapons. It is rock-solid and strong like true vajra—it is unbreakable.

Owing precisely to the body’s nature of being devoid of a defining characteristic, they know that things have the nature of being devoid of a defining characteristic. The body’s nature of being devoid of a defining characteristic and the nature of all things as being devoid of a defining characteristic cannot be separated into a duality. The fact that the essential defining characteristic of the body is precisely its being devoid of a defining characteristic is the essential defining characteristic of a thing’s being devoid of a defining characteristic. Thus, the bodhisattvas conform to the nature of things as being devoid of a defining characteristic. They make their own body’s nature of being devoid of a defining characteristic equal to the nature of all beings’ bodies as being devoid of a defining characteristic. {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-039-003-1870,folio:F.108.b}}} They know that their own body’s nature of being devoid of a defining characteristic and the nature of all beings’ bodies as being devoid of a defining characteristic is the nature of the realm of reality as being devoid of a defining characteristic.

The way things are has no form at all, and what has no form is called the way things are. Just as the way things are has no form, in the same way all forms have no form. Although bodhisattvas display their forms to all beings, they do not turn the way things are into a form. Even though they are formless and beyond conflict {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-039-003-1871,folio:F.109.a}}} and they display diverse bodies and forms, still they do not disturb the way things are.

They will experience their bodies free from all misery. {{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-039-003-1872,folio:F.109.b}}} This is due to the complete purification of that bodhisattva’s previous vows.

At that time, there was a tree called the Excellent King of Banyan Trees, which was covered by many branches and leaves. The crown of the tree was several miles in circumference and the sage, Light, dwelled beneath that tree.

At a certain point the brahmin, Śyāmaka, had been out seeking alms in the village, and because it was midday he went beneath that banyan tree to take his meal. He came before the sage, Light, and was truly delighted to see him. Sitting together, they spoke of many topics about which they were passionate. Then, the sage, Light, said to the brahmin Śyāmaka, ‘Excuse me, brahmin, but do you think there are any humans in this world of beings who have the ability to count, directly perceive, or know the number of leaves on this Excellent King of Banyan Trees?’

Also, they undertake their work with knowledge without weakening any of the supernormal faculties. They manifest all sorts of actions while making child’s play of the supernormal faculties. They have attained the great mastery that is the mastery of the supernormal faculties. The supernormal faculties they possess are an aspect of knowledge because they are connected with the supreme knowledge of all aspects. The supernormal faculties they possess are an aspect of wisdom because they provide a direct vision of all things. The supernormal faculties they possess have the aspect of inexhaustibility because they conform with everything. Because all forms do not have a form, the supernormal faculties they possess can see all forms. {{page:{number:30,id:UT22084-039-003-1882,folio:F.114.b}}} Because the sounds of the past are the same as the sounds of the future, the supernormal faculties they possess can comprehend all sounds. The supernormal faculties they possess perceive the thoughts of all beings, because they can perceive and thoroughly investigate the true nature of mind. The supernormal faculties they possess can recollect limitless eons, because they do not place any limits on the past or the future. The supernormal faculties they possess can produce every kind of wondrous transformation with their superhuman powers because they have the defining characteristic of being unconditioned. The supernormal faculties they possess conform to the cessation of the defilements, because they perceive the moment and they never miss the moment. The supernormal faculties they possess are conducive to the forms of penetrating insight that are fixed upon what is transcendent and noble. The supernormal faculties they possess are difficult for the disciples and solitary buddhas to understand. The supernormal faculties they possess have profound meaning and defeat their adversaries, Māra in all his forms. The supernormal faculties they possess produce the essence of awakening and are the most supreme form of awakening, which brings about a perfect realization of all the qualities of a buddha. The supernormal faculties they possess are consistent with the turning of the wheel of Dharma. The supernormal faculties they possess can tame all beings. The supernormal faculties they possess secure empowering authority because they have mastery over all things.

This pure mind is immaculate and without any affliction; it is luminous, free from the derivative afflictions, and completely controlled. By being well guarded, it rests in the states of meditation, liberation, concentration, and absorption, but it does not sink into complete extinction or a state of nonarising. Instead, it intentionally takes birth in the desire realm and remains undisturbed by being here. It is not born in bondage. {{page:{number:31,id:UT22084-039-003-1883,folio:F.115.a}}} It does not die or transmigrate in bondage, and it is not reborn in bondage. How is this so?

Whoever knows the equality of all things is free from fixating on them as being either something or nothing, and knows that being beyond such fixation is the meaning of things.

It does not belong to the form realm, and it does not belong to the formless realm. What belongs to nothing whatsoever has no color, sign, or shape.

These beings consume the food and, their hunger abated and thirst slaked, they become at ease and their limbs feel good, and with ambition they conceive the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening, even those pretas dwelling in the world of Yama who have fallen into misfortune and are unable to conceive the aspiration for awakening. This very offering of food becomes the cause for them to do so until they reach complete cessation.{{note:{index:100,id:UT22084-039-003-460}}}
{{milestone:{label:7.45,id:UT22084-039-003-461}}}“In precisely this way, Śāntamati, you should understand that a realized one does not eat food, but rather a realized one possesses the food of the Dharma. Indeed, Śāntamati, the body of a realized one is like that of a Nārāyaṇa. It is rock-solid, strong, unbreakable, and made of vajra. Furthermore, Śāntamati, the body of the realized does not have a stomach or intestines, nor does it contain pus, blood, phlegm, snot, foulness, or excrement. Śāntamati, the body of a realized is like a lump of gold from the Jambu River. It is not hollow; it has no openings or any imperfections. Look, Śāntamati, at the greatness of the Realized One’s body! It is weighty and hard like vajra, but it is soft and pleasant to touch like the down of the kācalindika bird.

Śāntamati, when beings engaged in lustful behavior see the body of a realized one, then just by seeing the body of a realized one they know themselves to be free from lust. {{page:{number:65,id:UT22084-039-003-1917,folio:F.132.a}}} When beings engaged in hate-filled behavior see the body of a realized one, they attain love. When beings engaged in ignorant behavior see it, they attain the light of knowledge. When beings engaged in all three types of behavior to the same degree see it, they know themselves to be free from the afflictions. When beings who are miserly see it, they are inspired to give. When beings who are morally undisciplined see it, they are inspired to become disciplined. When beings who possess malicious thoughts see it, they attain patient acceptance. When those who are lazy see it, they are inspired to put forth heroic effort. When those who are distracted see it, they attain concentration. When those with poor discernment see it, they are inspired to attain wisdom. In short, noble son, when all those beings who are far from possessing good qualities see the body of a realized one, then just by seeing the body of a realized one they allay all thoughts rooted in vice and become established in virtuous thoughts, and the realized one does not form any concept in this respect and exists in a state of equanimity. This, too, Śāntamati, is the secret of the body of a realized one.

{{milestone:{label:8.1,id:UT22084-039-003-473}}}Once again, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, spoke to the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati: “Śāntamati, what is the secret of the speech and the purity of the verbal action of the Realized One? During the period of time, Śāntamati, from the night when the Realized One awakens to unsurpassable and perfect awakening until the night when, having relinquished his life force, a realized one passes into complete cessation, the Realized One has not articulated and will not pronounce even a single syllable.{{note:{index:106,id:UT22084-039-003-474}}}{{page:{number:67,id:UT22084-039-003-1919,folio:F.133.a}}} What is the cause of this? It is because, Śāntamati, a realized one is in a continuous state of meditative concentration. The realized one does not breathe in or breathe out. He does not begin any thought process or continue any thought process, and no speech emerges from what does not begin or continue any thought process. So, a realized one does not begin any thought process or continue any thought process or form any idea. He does not form any concept. He does not speak anything, he does not articulate anything, he does not pronounce anything; and yet, beings have the thought, ‘The Realized One is speaking.’
{{milestone:{label:8.2,id:UT22084-039-003-475}}}“A realized one is in a state of uninterrupted absorption, and he does not communicate any information with words at all. Yet, beings who place value on words have the thought, ‘The Realized One is teaching us the Dharma, and we have understood the Dharma that the Realized One has taught.’ Nevertheless, a realized one does not form concepts and is in a state of equanimity. Furthermore, Śāntamati, even though no sound issues from a realized one’s teeth, lips, palate, tongue, or mouth, what is heard and what comes out—that is, what comes out of a realized one in the form of words and sounds—issues from space, and yet beings still have the thought, ‘This is coming out of the mouth of the Realized One himself!’

It comes out as affectionate, tender, lovely, agreeable, pure, immaculate, illuminating, sweet-sounding,{{note:{index:108,id:UT22084-039-003-478}}} worth hearing, causing no offense, exciting interest, restrained, refined, smooth, well disciplined, pleasing to the ear, comforting to the body, satisfying to the mind, {{page:{number:68,id:UT22084-039-003-1920,folio:F.133.b}}} gladdening to the heart, bringing joy and happiness, causing no anguish, authoritative, insightful, clear, lovable, worthy of praise, informative, instructive, reasonable, relevant, and free from the fault of redundancy. It shocks like the roar of a lion. It echoes like the trumpet of a bull elephant. It reverberates like a peal of thunder. It resounds like the sound of the ocean. It sounds like a nāga lord, the music of gandharvas, the call of a cuckoo, the melodious voice of Brahmā, and the song of pheasants. It sounds as sweet as the voice of the king of the gods. It sounds like a drum. It is modest, superior, and it permeates all languages. It is free from bad language. It is not deficient. It is undaunted, irrepressible, joyful, comprehensive, smooth, continuous, and playful.{{note:{index:109,id:UT22084-039-003-479}}} It completes all sounds and satisfies all the senses.

Indeed, Śāntamati, a realized one does not have the thought, ‘I am teaching, instructing, delivering, distributing, describing, expounding, or clarifying any discourse, recitation, or prediction; or any verse text, inspired utterance, frame story, “thus it was said” story, jātaka tale, extended discourse, miracle story, or instructions; {{page:{number:69,id:UT22084-039-003-1921,folio:F.134.a}}} or any exemplary story, past-life story, avadāna, or parable.’{{note:{index:110,id:UT22084-039-003-481}}} Nevertheless, whatever assembly has gathered around the realized one, regardless of whether it is an assembly of monks, or an assembly of nuns, laymen, or laywomen, or an assembly of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, or mahoragas, with their disparate faculties and strength, by hearing the Dharma everyone is made to understand that the Dharma comes out of the mouth of the realized one, and these teachings of the Dharma overcome any differences in their respective means of expression so that everyone understands the formulation of the Dharma as being particularly for them. Śāntamati, this is the secret of the speech of a realized one.
{{milestone:{label:8.5,id:UT22084-039-003-482}}}“Moreover, Śāntamati, the Realized One has spoken about the immeasurable conduct of immeasurable beings, and while it has been said that there are eighty-four thousand types of conduct of beings, this is taught by the Realized One as an introductory teaching for beings whose spiritual faculties are weak. In fact, Śāntamati, beings’ conduct is immeasurable, and even an eon would not suffice to describe the conduct of those beings engaged in lustful behavior. An eon would not suffice to describe the conduct of those engaged in hate-filled behavior, those engaged in ignorant behavior, or those engaged in all three types of behavior to the same degree. Śāntamati, imagine if the Realized One were to teach only about the conduct of beings for the entirety of his lifespan of one whole eon.{{note:{index:111,id:UT22084-039-003-483}}}{{page:{number:70,id:UT22084-039-003-1922,folio:F.134.b}}} He would reach the end of his life while still teaching about the conduct of beings, and he still would not reach the end of the conduct of beings. Also, he would not have any time for any other Dharma teachings. Thus, the Realized One describes the immeasurable conduct of beings as though it could be measured, because otherwise beings would fall into confusion. In this respect, Śāntamati, the Realized One’s speech about the conduct of all beings comes out in such a way that it gives them an understanding of their conduct. This, too, Śāntamati, is the secret of the speech of a realized one.
{{milestone:{label:8.6,id:UT22084-039-003-484}}}“Indeed, Śāntamati, those beings who have immersed themselves in the knowledge of the secret of a realized one’s speech do not believe that the Realized One’s speech comes out of his mouth. Instead, they know that it issues from space. Śāntamati, even though it is the case that some beings believe that the Realized One’s speech comes out of his mouth, this is not something that ought to be apparent to you. Why not? Śāntamati, there are some beings who believe that the speech of the Realized One issues from the uṣṇīṣa. Some believe it issues from the top of the head or from the hair. Some believe it issues from the shoulders, while some believe it issues from the forehead, or from the eyebrows, or from the tuft of hair between the eyebrows; or from the eyes, ears, nose, cheeks, mouth, or neck; or likewise from the arms, hands, fingers, ribs, chest, back, navel, private parts, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, or the soles of the feet; or from the primary or the secondary marks of a great being; and some beings believe it issues from each and every pore of the skin on his body.

Śāntamati, this is analogous to a well-crafted musical instrument, a wind bell, which makes a sweet sound without being touched by a hand, but rather when it is moved by the wind. It does not make any special effort to produce a sound, but still it makes a sweet sound because of the special nature of its previous preparation. In the same way, Śāntamati, a realized one’s speech comes out when it is moved by knowledge of beings’ motivations, but a realized one does not make any special effort in this regard to produce it. Rather, a realized one’s speech conforms to the sense perceptions of all beings because of the special nature of a realized one’s previous preparation.

Yet, the precious gem does not form concepts. In the same way, Śāntamati, the gem of a realized one’s speech, which is pure in its ambition, is known to emit a realized one’s speech in accordance with the wishes of any being, whatever they are, {{page:{number:72,id:UT22084-039-003-1924,folio:F.135.b}}} when it is fastened to the top of the flagpole of great compassion.

Śāntamati, I remember one time when the Blessed One was residing right here in Rājagṛha on the hill Vulture Peak, surrounded by a multitude of bodhisattvas. He was revealing at length a teaching of the Dharma called ‘the purification of the sphere of sound,’ and after he had empowered the bodhisattva of great courage, Maitreya, he was nearing the end of the discourse. At that moment, Venerable Maudgalyāyana the Great thought to himself, ‘How far does the Realized One’s sphere of sound go? I would like to measure the Realized One’s sphere of sound.’ So, the elder, Maudgalyāyana the Great, vanished from his seat and reappeared on the summit of Mount Meru, but while he was standing there he still heard the speech of the Realized One just as clearly as before. So, with the strength of his own superhuman powers, he went to the west of this cosmos of a billion worlds, beyond Mount Meru, beyond the four continents, beyond the mountain ranges and great mountain ranges, until he stood on the peak of the mountain range at the end of the world. However, even there he could hear the Blessed One’s speech just as clearly as before.{{note:{index:115,id:UT22084-039-003-492}}} It was the same, nothing more or less.

{{milestone:{label:9.1,id:UT22084-039-003-607}}}Once more Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, spoke to the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati: “In this regard, Śāntamati, what is the secret of the mind of the realized ones and the purity of their mental action? Śāntamati, let me draw an analogy: Those beings who have been reborn among the classes of gods in the formless realm remain focused upon a single object of consciousness for eighty-four thousand eons. They do not change the object of their consciousness to a different object of consciousness so long as their concentration lasts until the time they die and acquire another rebirth in accordance with their accumulation of karma. In precisely the same way, Śāntamati, a realized one has a mind that is not fixed on anything, in such a way that from the night when the bodhisattva awakens to unsurpassable and perfect awakening until the night when the Realized One passes into complete cessation, the state of cessation that is free of any remaining thing, during the intervening time there is no modification of the Realized One’s mind; no mental activity; no mental examination; no forgetfulness of mind;{{note:{index:143,id:UT22084-039-003-608}}} no mental alteration;{{note:{index:144,id:UT22084-039-003-609}}} no measurement of mind; no excitement of mind;{{note:{index:145,id:UT22084-039-003-610}}} no mental conflict;{{note:{index:146,id:UT22084-039-003-611}}} no mental avoidance;{{note:{index:147,id:UT22084-039-003-612}}} no mental distraction; no mental elation; no mental depression; no mental protection; no movement of mind; no excessive joyfulness in the mind; no mental disturbance;{{note:{index:148,id:UT22084-039-003-613}}} no malice in the mind; no vacillation of mind; no special comprehension of mind; no mental stimulation; no mental pressure; no application of mind; no wandering of the mind; no formation of ideas in the mind; no mental conceptualization; no mental imagination; no calming state of mind, no deep mental insight; {{page:{number:90,id:UT22084-039-003-1941,folio:F.144.b}}} no consciousness that chases after thoughts; no dwelling on one’s own thoughts; no mental perception of the thoughts of others; no support from the mind for the eye; no support from the mind for the intellect, the physical body, the tongue, nose, or ear; no support from the mind for visual forms; no support from the mind for thoughts, tactile sensations, tastes, smells, or sounds; no support from the mind for mental objects; no place in the mind for mental appearances; no mind that is without a place; no internal place for the mind; and no external place for the mind. He also has a mind that does not engage with things, a mind that does not engage with knowledge,{{note:{index:149,id:UT22084-039-003-614}}} and also a mind that is not perceived as being past, present, or future.
{{milestone:{label:9.2,id:UT22084-039-003-615}}}“In this way, Śāntamati, a realized one has purity of mind, and he does not produce any mental object with the mind. Yet, he develops a knowledge and vision toward all things without any aversion or attachment. With the purity of his own mind, he does not perceive the mind of any being as impure. He sees, but he does not see anything, and he does not form any concepts. He sees, but he does not generate any conceptual elaborations. He does not see seeing or discerning by means of seeing.{{note:{index:150,id:UT22084-039-003-616}}} In addition, the knowledge of the realized one is not connected with the vision of the eye of flesh, nor is it connected with the vision of the divine eye, nor is it connected with the vision of the eye of wisdom, nor is it connected with the vision of the eye of Dharma, nor is it connected with the vision of the buddha eye. It is not connected with the hearing of the divine ear. It is not connected with the knowledge of others’ minds. It is not connected with the remembrance of past lives. It is not connected with the marvelous manifestation of superhuman powers. It is not connected with the knowledge of the destruction of the defilements. 
{{milestone:{label:9.3,id:UT22084-039-003-617}}}“He is disconnected from attachment to everything while not being disconnected from anything, and thus streams of a realized one’s knowledge become manifest for him effortlessly, spontaneously, and without fabrication {{page:{number:91,id:UT22084-039-003-1942,folio:F.145.a}}} so that he perceives the behaviors of all beings, knows about the purification of all beings’ afflictions, and never becomes bewildered. This is due to the ten powers, the forms of self-assurance, and the eighteen unique attributes of a buddha. These qualities of a realized one come into being spontaneously, effortlessly, and without fabrication. Moreover, a realized one is free of mental consciousness and mind; he does not leave the state of meditative concentration, but he performs all the deeds of a buddha.{{note:{index:151,id:UT22084-039-003-618}}} Due to the fact that his knowledge is unattached to everything, he does not cling to anything. 
{{milestone:{label:9.4,id:UT22084-039-003-619}}}“Indeed, Śāntamati, consider the example of a realized one who magically creates the form of a second realized one. While no mind, no mental consciousness, no bodily formations, no verbal formations, and no mental formations are produced with respect to this magically created form, it still performs all the deeds of a buddha, and it does so only by means of the majestic power of a buddha. In precisely the same way, Śāntamati, a realized one, being equivalent to a magically created form and something that does not form concepts, because it has the quality of a magically created form, does not appear as something of bodily origin, verbal origin, or mental origin, but performs all the deeds of a buddha, and does so spontaneously, effortlessly, and without fabrication.{{note:{index:152,id:UT22084-039-003-620}}} Why is this? Śāntamati, a realized one has awoken to the fact that all things have, as their defining characteristic, the essential nature of being magically created, and having awoken to this fact, a realized one illuminates all things out of compassion for beings.
{{milestone:{label:9.5,id:UT22084-039-003-621}}}“Moreover, Śāntamati, a realized one’s knowledge is not founded on what is conditioned, nor is it founded on what is unconditioned. It is not founded on the aggregates, nor is it founded on the elements, nor is it founded on the sense spheres. {{page:{number:92,id:UT22084-039-003-1943,folio:F.145.b}}}. It is not founded on what is interior, nor is it founded on what is exterior. It is not founded on what is good, nor is it founded on what is bad. It is not worldly, nor is it transcendent. It is not blameworthy, nor is it blameless. It is not defiled, nor is it undefiled. It is not situated in the past, nor is it situated in the future, nor is it situated in the present. It is not based on enumerative analysis, nor does it come from a lack of enumeration. In this way, Śāntamati, a realized one is one whose knowledge has no foundation. Without undertaking anything whatsoever, but out of compassion for beings, his knowledge and vision of the thoughts, actions, and motivations of all beings arises without attachment or impediment, and this happens effortlessly, spontaneously, and without fabrication.{{note:{index:153,id:UT22084-039-003-622}}}

For it was because of the previous vow made by the grass seller Svastika—namely, ‘I will be responsible for spreading out the mats upon the seat of awakening for all the bodhisattvas of this Fortunate Eon.’ Now, what was the cause of this? I know from first-hand experience, Śāntamati, that in the past, ninety-one eons before our Fortunate Eon, a realized one, a worthy one, a perfectly awakened buddha named Vipaśyin arose in the world. He was perfected in knowledge and conduct, a sublime one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable trainer of those ready to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha.

{{milestone:{label:12.64,id:UT22084-039-003-740}}}“Now again, Śāntamati, if one were to have the doubt, the differing opinion, or the question that perhaps the person who was the householder Matimat at that moment and time was someone else, one should not see it in that way. That is because the grass seller Svastika was at that moment and time the householder named Matimat. Furthermore, Śāntamati, in this very same manner you should understand the previous vow of the grass seller Svastika to be such that he gives a bunch of grass to some of the bodhisattvas and he presents some bodhisattvas with lion’s seats set with splendid arrays of jewels, according to the motivations of beings{{note:{index:184,id:UT22084-039-003-741}}} and according to the degree of maturity of their spiritual faculties.

He then bowed down to the tree of awakening and walked around it seven times, keeping it on his right. Just as soon as the Bodhisattva had spread out his seat of grass, Śāntamati, eighty-four thousand deities also prepared eighty-four thousand lion’s seats for the Bodhisattva. These seats were multicolored, beautiful to behold, tall, and lofty. They were entirely studded with jewels, raised upon jeweled daises, covered by jeweled nets, and draped with nets that had tiny bells woven into them. The seats had strands of pearls hung on them, and they were arranged upon several thousand bolts of cloth. Śāntamati, the Bodhisattva then displayed himself seated upon each and every one of those eighty-four thousand lion’s seats. Yet, the deities did not see each other. They were not aware of each other. Rather, each and every deity knew only this: ‘The Bodhisattva is seated upon my lion’s seat. Seated upon my lion’s seat, he will awaken to unsurpassable, perfect awakening.’ As a result of the joy and pleasure they felt at this very thought, they all became unable to be turned back from unsurpassable, perfect awakening.

This light is called challenging Māra, {{page:{number:109,id:UT22084-039-003-1960,folio:F.154.a}}} and it reached a billion māras throughout the cosmos of a billion worlds and touched each of them in their respective abodes, which immediately gave them goose bumps. When they realized that their abodes were being consumed by the light and made dim in comparison, they thought to themselves, ‘What is the cause of this? For what reason have these abodes seemingly been made dim? Could it not be that a bodhisattva is seated on the seat of awakening and is awakening to unsurpassable, perfect awakening?’ Looking down, they saw that the Bodhisattva was seated at the seat of awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:13.2,id:UT22084-039-003-752}}}“At that point, each and every one of those evil māras vanished from their respective abodes. Each and every māra was surrounded by immeasurable, incalculable hundreds of thousands of millions and billions of yakṣas. The yakṣas had various complexions, various disguises, various appearances, various heights, various turbans, and various heads. The yakṣas were carrying various weapons and various victory banners. Uttering various expressions, and with the great majestic power of a māra and the great superhuman power of a māra, each and every māra approached the tree of awakening so that māras extended for twenty thousand leagues and the māras’ assembly extended for more than eighty-four thousand leagues.

Consequently, the Bodhisattva was seized by a feeling of great compassion at that moment, {{page:{number:110,id:UT22084-039-003-1961,folio:F.154.b}}} and so he concealed that sound, saying, ‘May this sound not harm beings! May it not kill them!’ This, Śāntamati, is the scope of a bodhisattva’s mastery of skill in means. Moreover, Śāntamati, even though he heard the noise, not even a single hair on the Bodhisattva’s body stood on end. Why was that? The reason is that he had completely understood that all sounds are just like echoes, including that noise too.

At that point, Śāntamati, the Bodhisattva raised his right arm, which was golden-colored, soft, youthful, full of vitality, and had made the preparations for liberation and the knowledges by practicing generosity, self-discipline, restraint, moral conduct, patience, heroic effort, meditation, wisdom, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, the applications of mindfulness, the right efforts, the foundations for superhuman power, the spiritual faculties, the powers, the constitutive factors of awakening, calm abiding, and deep insight for incalculable hundreds of thousands of millions and billions of eons, and he wiped his whole body clean, including the top of his head. Then, directed by great compassion and with the ambition to bring about the liberation of all beings, he brought down the blessed buddhas in all the worlds directly before him, and with attention and full awareness, he touched the great earth with his hand.

Hundreds of thousands of apsarases also worshiped him, sang songs of praise to him, and bowed down before him.

It isn’t that he only did so from the time when he first conceived the aspiration for awakening until he reached the seat of awakening. In this way, too, Śāntamati, one should understand that by the very act of being seated for awakening—just by that very act—a bodhisattva works for the benefit of immeasurable beings.

He bowed his head at the feet of the Blessed One and walked around him seven times, keeping him on the right, and entreated the Blessed One, ‘Teach the Dharma, Blessed One, so that the wheel of Dharma may be set in motion!

The reason is that just as Brahmā Śikhin entreated him, the Realized One was likewise being entreated by one billion other brahmās.

Just as Brahmā Śikhin prepared a lion’s seat for the Realized One, lion’s seats were likewise prepared for the Realized One by one billion other brahmās, one billion śakras, and one hundred billion bodhisattvas along with their retinues.

{{milestone:{label:16.9,id:UT22084-039-003-885}}}When this was said, the Blessed One spoke {{page:{number:134,id:UT22084-039-003-1985,folio:F.166.b}}} to the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati: “While holding up this vajra, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, will worship all the realized ones of this Fortunate Eon, Śāntamati. He will take hold of the true Dharma, he will propagate this teaching of the Dharma on the secret of the realized ones, and he will make immeasurable beings ready for awakening.
{{milestone:{label:16.10,id:UT22084-039-003-886}}}“When the Fortunate Eon has ended and the true Dharma of the realized one, Roca, has disappeared, he will be born in the buddha domain of the realized one Akṣobhya. Taking birth in that Abhiratī world along with the realized one Akṣobhya, he will then maintain the teaching of the bodhisattvas on the one hundred and eight seals, go farther down the path to the goal, and become accomplished in understanding the way things are. In that way, he will encounter immeasurable, incalculable realized ones in the future. He will serve them, respect them, honor them, worship them, and he will lead the holy life in their presence. He will safeguard the true Dharma and make immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions and billions of beings ready for perfect awakening.
{{milestone:{label:16.11,id:UT22084-039-003-887}}}“Finally, after traveling through more eons than there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, he will bring to completion the constitutive factors of awakening and awaken to unsurpassable, perfect, and complete awakening. He will appear as a realized one, a worthy one, a perfectly awakened one, one perfected in knowledge and conduct, a sublime one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable trainer of those ready to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha known as Vajravikrāmin in the world called Samantapariśuddhā, {{page:{number:135,id:UT22084-039-003-1986,folio:F.167.a}}} and this will occur during the era called Viśodhana.
{{milestone:{label:16.12,id:UT22084-039-003-888}}}“Moreover, noble son, Samantapariśuddhā, which will be the buddha domain of the blessed realized one Vajravikrāmin, will be wealthy, expansive, bountiful,{{note:{index:229,id:UT22084-039-003-889}}} pleasant, well populated with many gods and human beings, and packed with bodhisattvas. This buddha domain will be adorned with the seven precious substances: gold, silver, lapis lazuli, quartz, agate, emerald, and red pearl. The world will be separated into square plots like a chessboard. It will be as flat as the palm of one’s hand and pleasant to touch like the down of the kācalindika bird. It will be adorned with raised flags, victory banners, and parasols fringed with bunches of silken tassels. It will be covered with divine blossoms and jeweled flowers. The air will be filled with the smell of the finest incense, and the sky above it will resound with divine music. This world will be devoid of all the bad realms of rebirth and the unfavorable circumstances for practicing the Dharma. This world will be adorned with dwellings, floating palaces, and parks as though they were ornaments, and there will be food and drink to the heart’s content, just like the enjoyments of the gods in the Heaven of the Contented. 
{{milestone:{label:16.13,id:UT22084-039-003-890}}}“Even though the enjoyments there in the pavilions with their high peaks will be earthly and divine enjoyments, all the gods and human beings there will have their interest piqued by what is lofty; that is, they will take a keen interest in the knowledge of the buddhas. In that world, the names of the two other vehicles—that is, the Vehicle of the Disciples and the Vehicle of the Solitary Buddhas—will not even exist. There, the realized one Vajravikrāmin will be surrounded by an assembly of many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas, and that blessed one will give the bodhisattvas teachings that are completely unadulterated.
{{milestone:{label:16.14,id:UT22084-039-003-891}}}“Furthermore, the beings in that world will not see their customs degenerate, their livelihoods will not become corrupted, their moral conduct will not decline, and neither will their views degenerate. {{page:{number:136,id:UT22084-039-003-1987,folio:F.167.b}}} The beings there will not be blind, crippled, hunchbacked, tongue-tied, mute, or lame,{{note:{index:230,id:UT22084-039-003-892}}} and neither will they have any impaired faculties. All the gods and humans will be adorned with twenty-eight of the marks of a great person. There, the length of that realized one’s life will span eight intermediate eons. The gods and humans will not die before their time is ripe. Indeed, Śāntamati, these are just some of the immeasurable number of special conditions and qualities of the realized one Vajravikrāmin; there are many others, too.
{{milestone:{label:16.15,id:UT22084-039-003-893}}}“Additionally, when that realized one teaches the Dharma, he will give off light from his body. Now, when those beings see this light, they will think, ‘The Realized One is starting to give a teaching of the Dharma, so we should go to the Blessed One to listen to the Dharma.’ Some will arrive through the power of their own superhuman abilities and supernormal faculties. Some will arrive by means of the empowering authority of that realized one, who will then rise into the sky above the gods and human beings who have gathered there to a height of one hundred thousand palm trees. While hovering there in a cross-legged position, he will pervade that world of four great continents with his body. He will then teach the Dharma to those bodhisattvas using the speech a realized one, which satisfies all beings according to their own thoughts and motivations, and with the voice and tone of a buddha, which can be understood throughout an immeasurable number of worlds in the ten directions. Moreover, not even a single being among them will go against or offer resistance to the Dharma taught by that realized one. Each and every one of those beings will have sharp faculties and the ability to understand highly condensed statements. In that world, there will be no king other than the true king of the Dharma, the realized one Vajravikrāmin. In that world, there will not be any possession {{page:{number:137,id:UT22084-039-003-1988,folio:F.168.a}}} or sense of ownership, either. All those beings will be without possessions or a sense of ownership.
{{milestone:{label:16.16,id:UT22084-039-003-894}}}“Moreover, Śāntamati, the form of the realized one Vajravikrāmin will appear in front of any gods or human-like beings who wish to make an offering of alms, and he will be holding his alms bowl so that they may do so. When any gods or human-like beings see that realized one’s form, they will think, ‘The blessed realized one Vajravikrāmin wishes to enjoy a meal in my presence.’ Then, with their minds they will create a circular space with seats and places to lie down, and food and drink, and they will tell that blessed one that it is time for the midday meal. Then, that realized one will enjoy the meal, and after enjoying it, he will depart. When that realized one goes into seclusion, the bodhisattvas there will dwell in an array of states of meditative concentration. That world will possess these special conditions and qualities and an immeasurable number of others. Therefore, noble son, that world is called Samantapariśuddhā.”
{{milestone:{label:16.17,id:UT22084-039-003-895}}}Furthermore, while the description of the prediction for Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, was being was being elucidated, twenty thousand beings conceived the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening. They made the vow, “I will be reborn in that buddha domain!” The Blessed One then made the prediction that all of them would be reborn there in Samantapariśuddhā, the buddha domain of the blessed realized one Vajravikrāmin.
{{milestone:{label:16.18,id:UT22084-039-003-896}}}Now, after Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, heard the prediction given for him, he was satisfied, overjoyed, pleased, and glad. He felt both delight and cheerfulness of mind, and he threw his vajra up into the vault of the sky. Right when he threw the vajra, at that precise moment, {{page:{number:138,id:UT22084-039-003-1989,folio:F.168.b}}} this cosmos of a billion worlds quaked in the six ways, and it rained a shower of flowers. It resounded with the sounds of hundreds of musical instruments. Garlands of flowers of various colors spontaneously manifested in the right hands of everyone in the assembly. Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, then praised the Blessed One with these verses:
{{milestone:{label:16.19,id:UT22084-039-003-897}}}“Lord of Dharma, you are an abundant and inexhaustible treasury of the true Dharma. 
You are skilled in the fine analysis of things everywhere for the benefit of the world.
Your heart is unwearied toward things; your detachment and surrender are firm.
Homage to you who are fixed upon the practice of such true forms of the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:16.20,id:UT22084-039-003-898}}}“For your knowledge and your purified conduct, O Pure Being, 
Full of virtue like a king, your glory known far and wide through the three worlds, 
An inexhaustible stream of knowledge, now and forever through the three times,
I offer salutations to you whose level now is equal to the surpassing of attachment.

The supreme splendor of your fine radiance surpasses the radiance of the sun.
The holy tones of your fine voice surpass the intonations of a brahmā.
I salute you, your radiance that of gold, foremost even among the Three Jewels.
{{milestone:{label:16.22,id:UT22084-039-003-901}}}“You display a body, but you are not at all bound to a body.
You speak with a voice, but concepts have no hold over you.
You proclaim the Dharma, but you have no fixed notion of a dharma.
You cause the liberation of beings, but you have no idea of a being.
{{milestone:{label:16.23,id:UT22084-039-003-902}}}“At no point whatsoever would it be possible to repay you,
Not even by all the beings of the world freed from the troubles of the home,
Except insofar as those beings understand what you have taught, 
Dwell in the core of the practices, and are trained thereby in the truth.”
{{milestone:{label:16.24,id:UT22084-039-003-903}}}At that point, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, and all the members of the assembly who had been holding various jeweled garlands of flowers in their hands, completely covered the Blessed One with them. Right when those garlands of flowers were strewn at him, at that precise moment, this cosmos of a billion worlds became completely adorned with garlands of various flowers, and it also appeared as though it were separated into square plots like a chessboard. This was accomplished through the wondrous power of the Buddha. {{page:{number:139,id:UT22084-039-003-1990,folio:F.169.a}}}

{{milestone:{label:17.1,id:UT22084-039-003-906}}}At that point, the bodhisattva Śāntamati said this to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas: “The Realized One has made a prediction for you, Lord of the Guhyakas.”
Vajrapāṇi responded, “The prediction made for me, noble son, is one that has the nature of a dream.”
{{milestone:{label:17.2,id:UT22084-039-003-908}}}“What have you been predicted to obtain?”
“The prediction I have obtained, noble son, is for what does not obtain.”
{{milestone:{label:17.3,id:UT22084-039-003-910}}}“What does not obtain?
“A being, a life force, a person, an individual entity, and a human being—these do not obtain.{{note:{index:233,id:UT22084-039-003-912}}} The aggregates, elements, and sense spheres do not obtain. It is the same with virtue, vice, purity, impurity, the defiled, the undefiled, the mundane, the transcendent, the conditioned, the unconditioned, the afflicted, the cleansed, saṃsāra, and nirvāṇa—these do not obtain.”
{{milestone:{label:17.4,id:UT22084-039-003-913}}}“If they do not obtain, then what was predicted here?”
“What was predicted is the knowledge that comes from the understanding of what cannot be grasped by the mind.”

“If it were produced by duality,” Vajrapāṇi responded, “then one could not obtain a prediction. Since knowledge is not produced by duality, the predictions bodhisattvas obtain are only nondual predictions.”
{{milestone:{label:17.6,id:UT22084-039-003-918}}}Śāntamati then asked, “If knowledge is produced by nonduality, then who gives the prediction and who receives the prediction?”
“The one who gives the prediction and the one who receives the prediction are obtained by understanding that they are same. They are conceived from the position of nonduality.”{{note:{index:235,id:UT22084-039-003-920}}}

“For whichever position one has, that position being the position of nonduality, there is a prediction precisely for the one who has that position.”
{{milestone:{label:17.8,id:UT22084-039-003-923}}}“For which position is there a prediction for the one who stands thereon?”
“For one who stands on the position that there is a self, there is a prediction. For one who stands on the position that there is a being, there is a prediction, as well as for one who stands on the position that there is a life force or a person.”

{{milestone:{label:18.1,id:UT22084-039-003-985}}}Now, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, was satisfied, overjoyed, pleased, and glad. He felt both delight and cheerfulness of mind at having received the prediction of the fulfillment of his intention. So he said to the Blessed One, “Would you please show compassion for me, Blessed One, and come with these bodhisattvas and great disciples to the capital city of Aḍagavatī in my abode of guhyakas and stay there for seven days? The reason, Blessed One, is that there are many different types of beings, such as yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, rākṣasas, piśācas, gandharvas, and mahoragas, dwelling in the capital city of Aḍagavatī. Seeing the Blessed One and hearing the Dharma will be to their benefit, prosperity, bliss, and aims for a long time, and from then on they will abstain from thoughts that are sullied by wickedness and anger. For the Four Great Kings and their assemblies, too, {{page:{number:143,id:UT22084-039-003-1994,folio:F.171.a}}} it will be to their benefit, prosperity, bliss, and aims for a long time.”
{{milestone:{label:18.2,id:UT22084-039-003-986}}}By remaining silent, the Blessed One gave his consent that he would go to the capital city of Aḍagavatī in the abode of the Lord of the Guhyakas, together with the bodhisattvas and great disciples, and stay there for seven days. He did so out of compassion for Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, and with the aim to cultivate further the roots of virtue of immeasurable beings and to fulfill the wishes of Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas. Knowing that the Blessed One had given his consent by remaining silent, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, was satisfied, overjoyed, pleased, and glad. He felt both delight and cheerfulness of mind. He bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet and walked around him seven times, keeping him on the right. He then took leave of the Blessed One, and having left his presence, he went to the capital city of Aḍagavatī in his own abode. 
{{milestone:{label:18.3,id:UT22084-039-003-987}}}At that point, it occurred to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, “I ought to make my courtyard into such an array of adornments that, when I perform the worship of the Realized One, all the gods from the desire and form realms will be awestruck, and the bodhisattvas who gather from the ten directions will feel delighted, and so that the worship I perform for the Realized One will be something grand.” 
{{milestone:{label:18.4,id:UT22084-039-003-988}}}Then it occurred to him, “I remember one time the Blessed One, while he was resting for the night, entered a state of meditative concentration known as the endowment of inconceivable activity. He then went in the eastern direction, going past as many buddha domains as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, to a world named Anantaguṇaratnavyūha, the buddha domain of the blessed realized one Vyūharāja, in order to make predictions for ten thousand bodhisattvas there. In that buddha domain, {{page:{number:144,id:UT22084-039-003-1995,folio:F.171.b}}} I saw an inconceivable array that surpassed the arrays made by gods and human beings. For the worship of the Blessed One, I should make my courtyard into an array just like the array in Anantaguṇaratnavyūha.”
{{milestone:{label:18.5,id:UT22084-039-003-989}}}At that very moment, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, entered into the state of meditative concentration known as the king of great arrays and just as soon as Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, had entered into the meditative concentration the king of great arrays, at that very moment the courtyard situated the middle of the capital city of Aḍagavatī appeared as an array that was exactly like the array in Anantaguṇaratnavyūha. It was grand and expansive. It spanned sixty-four leagues from east to west, and from north to south it spanned thirty-two leagues. The surface of the floor was made of the bluest lapis lazuli. The surrounding walls were made of sapphire, and the twin enclosures were set with all manner of gems, inlaid with lotuses of gold from the Jambu River. It was decorated with colorful strands, arranged with many heavenly linens, draped with many strands of pearl, and adorned with numerous garlands of silken fillets. It was covered with many garlands of flowers, perfumed by many bowls of burning incense, and many heavenly flowers of different colors and blossoms of jewels were scattered throughout it. It was colorful, beautiful to behold, gratifying to the mind, stimulating to the body, and something that brought excitement to one’s thoughts. It was truly an accumulation of endless virtues, a description in praise of which would have no measure.
{{milestone:{label:18.6,id:UT22084-039-003-990}}}In the courtyard, many hundreds of thousands of lion’s seats spontaneously appeared. They were studded with jewels, raised upon jeweled daises, arrayed with jeweled lotuses, covered with nets of pearls, divided into squares like a chessboard, arranged upon many heavenly linens, and above them were coverings of nets of jewels. They were arrayed in ways previously unseen and unheard of, {{page:{number:145,id:UT22084-039-003-1996,folio:F.172.a}}} in ways that do not appear in many worlds, but the arrangement was set forth in such a way as to be appreciated by hundreds of different tastes. The hundreds of thousands of lion’s seats were set up so that they were not fixed upon the ground, and in the sky above them each and every lion’s seat was covered by a jeweled parasol endowed with the finest of all qualities.
{{milestone:{label:18.7,id:UT22084-039-003-991}}}Now, when he had created the array in the courtyard and the array of lion’s seats in that fashion, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, mindful and alert, arose from that meditative concentration. That night, he laid out an abundant and excellent meal, arrayed with many different flavors, made pure by the motivation of a bodhisattva, and worthy of being offered in worship to the Realized One. At the end of the night, he said to the Four Great Kings, “Friends, know this!

I invited the Blessed One to come to the capital city of Aḍagavatī and he has agreed to come. Therefore, do not be malicious, do not be hostile, but worship the Blessed One with a great deal of joy, faith, and the utmost delight, and listen to the Dharma, too.”

Appoint a caretaker of the monastery and empower him with authority for seven days.” Those disciples and bodhisattvas who had superhuman powers then rose into the air by the power of their own superhuman powers, while those who did not have superhuman powers stood within the sphere of the Realized One’s aura of light and traveled through the vault of the sky with the Blessed One. Then, surrounded by a host of bodhisattvas and at the head of a host of disciples, the Blessed One vanished from the hill, Vulture Peak, while a host of gods lauded him and a host of goddesses sung his praise, all of them radiating light, showering a rain of flowers, and playing millions upon billions of musical instruments as they made domains tremble.

The gods of the realms of desire and form saw the Blessed One coming from afar. As he flew freely through the vault of the sky, he looked like the sphere of the rising sun. He looked as if he were the full moon being encircled by a constellation of stars. He was surrounded by a host of gods as if he were Śakra, King of the Gods. He was surrounded by brahmās as if he were Great Brahmā.{{note:{index:243,id:UT22084-039-003-1006}}}

These and other flowers were strewn upon the Blessed One while the gods held aloft parasols, flags, and banners, and played hundreds of thousands of musical instruments.

He alighted at the assembly hall of the Great King Vaiśravaṇa, together with the bodhisattvas and great disciples, and just as soon as the Blessed One was standing firmly on the surface of the earth, at that precise moment in time the great earth shook, gently {{page:{number:149,id:UT22084-039-003-2000,folio:F.174.a}}} and slightly, so that no one was harmed by it.

When they arrived, first the Four Great Kings bowed their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and worshiped him with the scented oils, garlands, incense, and flowers that they had brought, and they stood to one side with their arms outstretched, palms together in a gesture of salutation. Then, the women from the Four Great Kings’ inner chambers, their assembled armies, and everyone else who had gathered there all bowed their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, and stretched out their arms, palms together in a gesture of salutation.

He approached the Blessed One, bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet, walked around him seven times, keeping him on the right, {{page:{number:150,id:UT22084-039-003-2001,folio:F.174.b}}} and worshiped the Blessed One with the flowers, incense, fragrances, garlands, scented oils, powders, linens, parasols, flags, and banners of various kinds that had been brought, and with music being made by singing and playing musical instruments.

{{milestone:{label:20.18,id:UT22084-039-003-1114}}}Thinking of what the sons of the Lord of the Guhyakas had requested of him, the Blessed One said to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, “So that the way of the true Dharma continues to exist for a long time and the māras and proponents of other doctrines are defeated in accordance with the Dharma, I request you, Lord of the Guhyakas, to speak the words of the mantra that you called to mind and then expressed and intoned in order to protect the Bodhisattva when he was seated at the supreme point of the seat of awakening and to defeat the māras when the armies of Māra had come there.”

As many different wishes as the beings had in that assembly in the capital city of Aḍagavatī, he fulfilled them all. 
{{milestone:{label:20.27,id:UT22084-039-003-1124}}}Then the Blessed One left the abode of Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, and, surrounded by the host of bodhisattvas and accompanied by the host of disciples, he flew freely through the vault of the sky like the king of swans, as a host of gods paid homage to him; a host of goddesses {{page:{number:171,id:UT22084-039-003-2022,folio:F.185.a}}} praised him; yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, and garuḍas surrounded him; and Śakra, Brahmā, and the Lokapālas offered him praise. The rays of light they emitted made a latticework of light, as musical instruments were played, it rained down showers of flowers, and all the domains trembled. All this was due to the great majestic power of the Buddha, the great superhuman power of the Buddha, the great transformative power of the Buddha, the great miraculous display of the Buddha, the great glory of the Buddha, the great vital energy of the Buddha, the great demeanor of the Buddha, and the great child’s play of the Buddha.

{{milestone:{label:21.1,id:UT22084-039-003-1128}}}At that point, the Blessed One remained at the hill, Vulture Peak, together with the bodhisattvas and great disciples. The Blessed One rested in the afternoon and then he got up and taught the Dharma. Then the sixty thousand inhabitants of the great city of Rājagṛha, including King Ajātaśatru and his household, came to know that the Blessed One had returned. So in the afternoon they took flowers, incense, garlands, and scented oils, left the great city of Rājagṛha and came to the hill, Vulture Peak, and into the presence of the Blessed One. They bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side. As they were sitting to one side, King Ajātaśatru spoke to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:21.2,id:UT22084-039-003-1129}}}“Blessed One,” he said, “I was sitting in my assembly hall, and my son, Given by the Frightful One, was there, too, and he said to me, ‘Father, I heard that the Blessed One had a meal {{page:{number:172,id:UT22084-039-003-2023,folio:F.185.b}}} in the capital city of Aḍagavatī in the abode of Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, and now he has returned.’ Regarding this, Blessed One, I had the following thought:
{{milestone:{label:21.3,id:UT22084-039-003-1130}}}“ ‘For what reason was the Blessed One invited to the capital city of Aḍagavatī in the abode of Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas? He must have gone to the capital city of Aḍagavatī in order to bring beings there to maturity, because there is no class of beings that is abandoned by the realized ones. The application of the blessed buddhas’ great compassion to those beings is marvelous! By making a prediction of Vajrapāṇi’s determination for the Dharma, the Realized One has delighted the Lord of the Guhyakas. The Blessed One’s greatness of self is marvelous!’
{{milestone:{label:21.4,id:UT22084-039-003-1131}}}“In the company of how many realized ones, worthy ones, fully awakened buddhas has Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, cultivated roots of virtue, Blessed One, so that he now possesses such inspired eloquence?”
{{milestone:{label:21.5,id:UT22084-039-003-1132}}}This is what he said, and the Blessed One then responded to King Ajātaśatru, “Great King, it is difficult for beings who have not developed the roots of virtue to take an interest in this matter. However, those who have developed the roots of virtue could take an interest in it. Great King, it is possible to comprehend an endpoint to the number of worlds throughout the ten directions, which are equal in number as the grains of sand in the Ganges, by doing a calculation. However, it is not possible to comprehend, by doing a calculation, an endpoint to the number of blessed buddhas worshiped and served by Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas. He has come to possess such inspired eloquence by leading the holy life in their vicinity.
{{milestone:{label:21.6,id:UT22084-039-003-1133}}}“It is in this fashion, Great King, that you should understand the following: Once upon a time, Great King, in a past eon, going back an incalculable eon, {{page:{number:173,id:UT22084-039-003-2024,folio:F.186.a}}} going back more than an incalculable eon, going back a limitless, inconceivable, and immeasureable span of time, there was an eon called Irreproachable. At that time, in a world called Land of Victory, there appeared a realized one, a worthy one, a perfectly awakened one, one perfected in knowledge and conduct, a sublime one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable trainer of those ready to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha whose name was Vaiśramaṇa. The blessed realized one Vaiśramaṇa gave only teachings for bodhisattvas, such as, ‘Noble sons, you should practice with heroic effort, giving up even your body and life!’ 
{{milestone:{label:21.7,id:UT22084-039-003-1134}}}“At that time, Great King, there was a bodhisattva named Śūrabala sitting in the assembly, and he said this to that blessed one:
{{milestone:{label:21.8,id:UT22084-039-003-1135}}}“ ‘The Blessed One has said to the bodhisattvas that we should practice, giving up even our bodies and lives. Regarding the meaning of the Blessed One’s statement, I would ask if it is appropriate, Blessed One, to say that those bodhisattvas who think that they should quickly awaken to unsurpassable and perfect awakening should be known as slothful ones for thinking such a thing. Why do I say so? Blessed One, bodhisattvas who practice with heroic effort do not conceive the thought of being exhausted by saṃsāra. Blessed One, bodhisattvas hold the view that saṃsāra is something to be celebrated because it enables them to bring beings to maturity, but they do not view nirvāṇa in this way. Blessed One, bodhisattvas work on behalf of beings. Why do I say so? Blessed One, for bodhisattvas who are ardently devoted to heroic effort, saṃsāra is a great pleasure, but they do not view nirvāṇa in this way. Why do I say so? Blessed One, bodhisattvas who work on behalf of beings become happy to the degree that they do the work that benefits beings. {{page:{number:174,id:UT22084-039-003-2025,folio:F.186.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:21.9,id:UT22084-039-003-1136}}}“ ‘What is there to be done, Blessed One, by someone who has passed into nirvāṇa? Bodhisattvas who think in this way, Blessed One, make saṃsāra their field of action even though the pleasures of saṃsāra do not have any flavor. They do not make nirvāṇa their field of action. Blessed One, bodhisattvas who make saṃsāra their field of action, even though the pleasures of saṃsāra do not have any flavor, and work on behalf of beings gain the vision of an immeasurable number of blessed buddhas, hear about the immeasurable nature of the Dharma, and bring an immeasurable number of beings to maturity. Blessed One, bodhisattvas who make saṃsāra their field of action become immersed in the field of action of beings. Blessed One, bodhisattvas who take nirvāṇa as their field of action sink into apathy.{{note:{index:270,id:UT22084-039-003-1137}}} When bodhisattvas are fearful of saṃsāra as a field of action, Blessed One, they fall into the state of having no field of action, and subsequently they do not work on behalf of beings. They do not become established in the field of action of the realized ones, and they do not become someone on whom all beings can depend.
{{milestone:{label:21.10,id:UT22084-039-003-1138}}}“ ‘What is the state of having no field of action? It is the state sought by disciples and solitary buddhas, a state of laxity in regard to the work of bringing beings to maturity. What is the reason for that? Blessed One, the disciple’s field of action is not the bodhisattva’s field of action. What is the reason for that? The field of action of the disciples and solitary buddhas is that of one who is afraid of saṃsāra. The bodhisattvas’ grasp of saṃsāra is immeasurable. In this respect, Blessed One, bodhisattvas dwell in their own field of action.’
{{milestone:{label:21.11,id:UT22084-039-003-1139}}}“This is what he said, Great King, and the realized one Vaiśramaṇa then said this to the bodhisattva Śūrabala: ‘Excellent, my good man, excellent!

“ ‘The bodhisattva’s own field of action, noble son, is the field of action of one who does not fear the immeasurable grasp of saṃsāra; one who celebrates the way of the bodhisattva; one who does not wish for the level of a disciple or a solitary buddha; one who gathers the means to sever the connection to rebirth in the three worlds, while knowing that there is no such connection; one who is skilled in the ways of making the roots of virtue grow; one who knows the means of drawing others to oneself; one who is skilled in accumulating all virtues; one who is skilled in not using up the supply of one’s merit, while understanding the nature of extinction; and one who is skilled in deliberately being reborn while realizing what is never born.

{{milestone:{label:22.1,id:UT22084-039-003-1155}}}At that point, it occurred to King Ajātaśatru, “The vajra that Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, is holding in his right hand must be heavy, because if it is light, why is Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, said to possess incredibly great strength?”
{{milestone:{label:22.2,id:UT22084-039-003-1156}}}Then, knowing with his own mind the train of thought of King Ajātaśatru, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, said to him, “It is, indeed, heavy, Great King, and it is light.”
{{milestone:{label:22.3,id:UT22084-039-003-1157}}}“For what reason is it heavy, and how is it light?”
“It is heavy, Great King, in order to gain full control over {{page:{number:179,id:UT22084-039-003-2030,folio:F.189.a}}} beings who are arrogant, conceited, haughty, and overly proud. For beings who are honest and humble, it is light.”
{{milestone:{label:22.4,id:UT22084-039-003-1159}}}Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, then used his empowering authority and made that spot of earth into vajra, and he placed his vajra on that ground. Just as soon as he set it down, the cosmos of a billion worlds quaked in six ways. Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, then said to King Ajātaśatru, “Lift this vajra off the ground, Great King.” 
{{milestone:{label:22.5,id:UT22084-039-003-1160}}}Then, as someone with the incredible strength of a being with a great physique, King Ajātaśatru thought, “I will lift this vajra,” but with all his incredible strength he could not move or budge it, even to the slightest degree. Awestruck, he stretched out his arms, palms together in a gesture of salutation, and said to the Blessed One, “With the incredible strength of a being with a great physique, I can lift an elephant that is fully arrayed with armor with one hand, but, Blessed One, I cannot move or budge this mere trifle of a vajra in the slightest, not to speak of lifting it.{{note:{index:273,id:UT22084-039-003-1161}}} What is the reason?”
{{milestone:{label:22.6,id:UT22084-039-003-1162}}}“Great King,” the Blessed One answered, “this vajra is heavy. Therefore, you cannot lift it.”
Then King Ajātaśatru said to Śakra, Lord of the Gods, “Kauśika, you are called ‘The Vajra-Bearer.’ Lift this vajra off the ground.” 
{{milestone:{label:22.7,id:UT22084-039-003-1164}}}Yet, even though he was in possession of a great reserve of power, both the power of his superhuman powers and his own incredible strength, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, was unable to move or budge the vajra. Awestruck, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, then said to the Blessed One, “At a time when I was waging war on the asuras, Blessed One, I was able to lift the chariot of the asura lord Vemacitra with just one hand, even though the chariot was more than seven hundred leagues long. Still, I am unable to move or even budge this mere trifle of a vajra. Blessed One, is this due to the empowering authority of the Buddha?” {{page:{number:180,id:UT22084-039-003-2031,folio:F.189.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:22.8,id:UT22084-039-003-1165}}}“Kauśika,” the Blessed One said, “this vajra is heavy, but it should be understood that this is not due to my empowering authority. What do you think, Kauśika? Is Mount Meru, the king of mountains, heavy?”
“Mount Meru is so heavy, Blessed One, that it would not be easy to describe how much, even by analogy.”
{{milestone:{label:22.9,id:UT22084-039-003-1167}}}“Kauśika,” continued the Blessed One, “this vajra is heavy, so much so that, for example, Kauśika, if Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, were to strike it against the Cakravāḍa Mountains, which form this world’s perimeter and are made of vajra, they would be pulverized into tiny bits no bigger than chaff. This vajra has that much incredible power, Kauśika.”
{{milestone:{label:22.10,id:UT22084-039-003-1168}}}Śakra, Lord of the Gods, then said to Venerable Maudgalyāyana the Great, “Revered Maudgalyāyana the Great, since you are foremost among the Blessed One’s disciples in the possession of superhuman powers, lift this vajra off the ground.”

{{milestone:{label:22.12,id:UT22084-039-003-1170}}}Venerable Maudgalyāyana the Great was awestruck. He bowed his head at the feet of the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, you have declared that I am foremost among the Blessed One’s disciples in the possession of superhuman powers. Blessed One, I have such great superhuman powers, such great exalted status, and such great majestic power that, if I wish, Blessed One, I can even hold all the water in the four great oceans in the palm of my hand. Blessed One, I could even make this cosmos {{page:{number:181,id:UT22084-039-003-2032,folio:F.190.a}}} of a billion worlds revolve in one direction and then reverse direction, just as if someone were rolling a coin back and forth with the tips of their fingers. Blessed One, I can even touch the sun and moon, which have such great superhuman power and such great majestic power. With one hand, I could even pick up Mount Meru, the king of mountains, and throw it as far as the world of Brahmā. Blessed One, I have even tamed the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda. Blessed One, I have even traveled to the Marīcika world. Blessed One, when I can do what I want even with things as large as Mount Meru, does the fact that I cannot move or even budge this mere trifle of a vajra indicate that the power of my superhuman powers is insufficient, Blessed One, or am I not the only one?”
{{milestone:{label:22.13,id:UT22084-039-003-1171}}}“Maudgalyāyana the Great,” the Blessed One answered, “it is not that the force of your superhuman powers is insufficient. Rather, when the empowering authority of a bodhisattva’s power cannot be shaken even by all the disciples and solitary buddhas, what more needs to be said about other beings? Maudgalyāyana, even if you were able to move the Mount Merus, those kings of mountains, that exist in as many buddha domains as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, you would still not be able to move this vajra from its place, even slightly.”
{{milestone:{label:22.14,id:UT22084-039-003-1172}}}Venerable Maudgalyāyana the Great then asked, “Does the fact that he holds this vajra, Blessed One, give Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, great power?”
“Maudgalyāyana,” the Blessed One answered, “even if all the Mount Merus that exist in this cosmos of a billion worlds were made into a single mountain and you were able to lift even that mountain, you would still not be able to lift this vajra.”
{{milestone:{label:22.15,id:UT22084-039-003-1174}}}At this, the elder, Maudgalyāyana the Great, was awestruck, and he said to the Blessed One, “It is marvelous, Blessed One, that Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, has the incredible power {{page:{number:182,id:UT22084-039-003-2033,folio:F.190.b}}} to hold this vajra. Blessed One, did Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, inherit this power from his parents, or is it the power of his own superhuman powers?”
The Blessed One answered, “Maudgalyāyana, the power that comes from human parents is sufficiently explained just by giving it a suitable name, whatever it may be, but if one were to explain fully the power of the superhuman powers of the bodhisattvas, then the world and its gods would be driven mad.” 
{{milestone:{label:22.16,id:UT22084-039-003-1176}}}At that point, the Blessed One surveyed all the directions with the gaze of a bull elephant, and then he said to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, “Lift this vajra from the ground, Lord of the Guhyakas!”
{{milestone:{label:22.17,id:UT22084-039-003-1177}}}Then, with his left hand, Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, lifted the vajra, which shook this cosmos of a billion worlds, and he threw it into the air, at which point it circled the sky seven times and returned to his right hand. Thereupon everyone in the assembly was awestruck, and stretching out their arms, palms together in a gesture of salutation, they paid homage to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, and said, “It is marvelous that the Lord of the Guhyakas possesses such incredible strength that he can hold this vajra in that way. Blessed One, may all beings come to possess such incredible power!”

{{milestone:{label:23.1,id:UT22084-039-003-1259}}}At that point, the bodhisattva of great courage, Śāntamati, said this to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas: “When the Blessed One creates magically created forms of himself, Lord of the Guhyakas, do you create magically created forms of yourself, too?”
{{milestone:{label:23.2,id:UT22084-039-003-1260}}}Vajrapāṇi responded, “I am an eyewitness to what comes directly before the eyes of the Blessed One, Śāntamati, and therefore, even if the Realized One were to create magically created forms of the Realized One equal in number to the grains of sand in the Ganges River, then precisely that many magically created forms of me would accompany them, taking a variety of forms and making child’s play in a variety of ways. This, Śāntamati, is a natural consequence of the purification of my motivation in the past.”
{{milestone:{label:23.3,id:UT22084-039-003-1261}}}The bodhisattva Śāntamati then said to Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, “Please make a request of the Blessed One, Lord of the Guhyakas, for this formulation of the Dharma to be circulated and widely distributed in the latter time—that is, in the final five-hundred-year period of the Dharma—and to come into the hands of those good persons {{page:{number:188,id:UT22084-039-003-2039,folio:F.193.b}}} who grasp on to the true Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:23.4,id:UT22084-039-003-1262}}}“This formulation of the Dharma has been empowered by all the buddhas, noble son,” the Lord of the Guhyakas replied. “For what reason do I say so? The syllables through which this formulation of the Dharma has been communicated are not real; they are not exhausted, and they do not disappear. Moreover, the meaning that is expressed through these syllables, too, cannot be made to disappear. The true Dharma of the Realized One is not something that can be made to disappear, Śāntamati, because, indeed, it has not arisen in the first place, and what does not arise, does not cease.
{{milestone:{label:23.5,id:UT22084-039-003-1263}}}“With this in mind, the Blessed One has said that whether the realized ones arise or they do not arise, this is what truly remains: the true nature of things wherein things are just as they are in the realm of reality. In this way, dependent arising is not impeded, and what does not impede dependent arising is the true Dharma. And the true Dharma is forever and not something that disappears—for this reason it is called the true Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:23.6,id:UT22084-039-003-1264}}}“Lord of the Guhyakas, those who prepare themselves to grasp the true Dharma, for what do they prepare themselves?” asked Śāntamati.
{{milestone:{label:23.7,id:UT22084-039-003-1265}}}“Those who prepare themselves to grasp the true Dharma prepare themselves not to oppose anything. What is the reason for this? It is because the true Dharma is precisely what does not oppose anything.”
{{milestone:{label:23.8,id:UT22084-039-003-1266}}}“How could there be an opposition to the Dharma?”
“From an opposition to syllables, there is an opposition to the Dharma, and the Dharma should not be opposed. Those who are not oppositional in this respect, they grasp the true Dharma completely.”
{{milestone:{label:23.9,id:UT22084-039-003-1268}}}“Is it possible, Lord of the Guhyakas, that a formulation could be opposed by the entire world, and yet it grasps the true Dharma?”
{{milestone:{label:23.10,id:UT22084-039-003-1269}}}“Yes, it is possible, Śāntamati. What is the reason for this? The world is strongly attached to views, Śāntamati, {{page:{number:189,id:UT22084-039-003-2040,folio:F.194.a}}} and so one who affirms emptiness is, for this reason, opposed by the whole world. The world affirms permanence, happiness, beauty, ‘I,’ and ‘mine,’ and so one who affirms impermanence, suffering, repulsiveness, ‘not-self,’ and ‘not-mine’ is, for this reason, opposed by the whole world. The world goes with the current, and so one who goes against the current is, for this reason, opposed by the whole world. The world puts the weight on this lifetime, and so one who puts the weight on a future lifetime is, for this reason, opposed by the whole world. The world is strongly attached to the aggregates, the elements, and the sense spheres, and so one who teaches the Dharma to be completely unattached to all things is, for this reason, opposed by the whole world. In this manner, Śāntamati, the one who is opposed by the whole world grasps the true Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:23.11,id:UT22084-039-003-1270}}}“Do you grasp the true Dharma, Lord of the Guhyakas?”
“I grasp it, noble son, but I do not grasp an ‘I,’ or a being, or a thing.”
{{milestone:{label:23.12,id:UT22084-039-003-1272}}}“How then do you grasp it?”
“I grasp it as something separate from and free of an ‘I,’ as something separate from and free of a being, and as something separate from and free of a thing, and as something not separate from and not free of an ‘I,’ a being, or a thing. I grasp it as something separate from and free of a past, a present, and a future, and as something not separate from and not free of a past, a present, and a future. I grasp it as something separate from and free of an awakened one, and as something not separate from and not free of an awakened one. I grasp it as something separate from and free of a domain, and as something not separate from and not free of a domain. I grasp it as something separate from and free of the Dharma, and as something not separate from and not free of the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:23.13,id:UT22084-039-003-1274}}}At that point, the Blessed One congratulated Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas: “Excellent, my good man, excellent! {{page:{number:190,id:UT22084-039-003-2041,folio:F.194.b}}} This is what it means to grasp the true Dharma. Moreover, Lord of the Guhyakas, those who grasp the true Dharma do not grasp anything or cling to anything, they do not grasp on to or act upon any vain imaginings of a mental image of a being, and they do not form an idea or form a concept of any figment of the imagination.”
{{milestone:{label:23.14,id:UT22084-039-003-1275}}}There was also a god named Bhadrarāja sitting in the assembly at that time, and he said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, calming is the word of the Buddha, and, Blessed One, what makes it the word of the Buddha is that it is the word of one who is calmed. So, one who is calmed possesses the word of the Buddha. In this regard, Blessed One, those who see all objects of cognition as being calmed are those who are calmed themselves. Being calmed themselves, they are not set on fire, they do not burn, and they are not consumed by fire.

{{milestone:{label:23.17,id:UT22084-039-003-1280}}}“Divine one, how is this inspired eloquence born?”
“It is born by reason of the fact that there is no inspired eloquence and there is an absence of inspired eloquence. Why do I say this? ‘No inspired eloquence’ is a way of saying that there is no link to rebirth, while ‘an absence of inspired eloquence’ is a way of saying that there is an absence of the proliferation of vain imagining. 
{{milestone:{label:23.18,id:UT22084-039-003-1282}}}“Furthermore, noble son, since you ask who possesses this inspired eloquence, it is the inspired eloquence of one for whom consciousness does not arise in regard to the imputation of a body,{{note:{index:284,id:UT22084-039-003-1283}}}{{page:{number:191,id:UT22084-039-003-2042,folio:F.195.a}}} and one for whom consciousness is not established in regard to the imputation of a self; it is the inspired eloquence of one for whom the imputation of a mind is not taken up as an object of cognition, and who dwells in a state in which things are unobscured; it is the inspired eloquence of one for whom knowledge does not arise with regard to anything, and one for whom nothing is especially known by means of knowledge; and it is the inspired eloquence of one who stands still,{{note:{index:285,id:UT22084-039-003-1284}}} does not exert any effort, but crosses the flood.

{{milestone:{label:25.18,id:UT22084-039-003-1372}}}Then five thousand gods, including Bhadrarāja, joined their palms together in a gesture of salutation and said this to the Blessed One: “We will support the Realized One’s awakening, Blessed One.” Then they spoke this verse:
{{milestone:{label:25.19,id:UT22084-039-003-1373}}}“We will remember this sūtra,
This profound teaching of the Buddha,
Out of a compassion made steady 
For the sake of all beings.”
{{milestone:{label:25.20,id:UT22084-039-003-1374}}}Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, Brahmā Śikhin, and the Great King Vaiśravaṇa spoke this verse:
{{milestone:{label:25.21,id:UT22084-039-003-1375}}}“Our aspiration conceived for the highest, 
We, too, will remember this sūtra,
Teacher, which is the same as medicine
That brings one freedom from all illness.”
{{milestone:{label:25.22,id:UT22084-039-003-1376}}}Then Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, said this to the Blessed One: “I, too, Blessed One, will remember the unsurpassable and perfect awakening of the Realized One, accomplished over an incalculable eon.” He then spoke a verse, too: {{page:{number:204,id:UT22084-039-003-2055,folio:F.201.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:25.23,id:UT22084-039-003-1377}}}“When the Dharma was wordless,
The Lord of Men, with compassion, 
Expressed it with words,
Words I will remember.”
{{milestone:{label:25.24,id:UT22084-039-003-1378}}}The Blessed One then said to Brahmā Śikhin, “There are three forms of worship and service to the Realized One that cannot be surpassed, Brahmā, unsurpassable acts of worship that generate immeasurable merit. What are these three? They are conceiving the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening, remembering the Dharma of the realized ones, and bringing one’s conduct into alignment with the Dharma precisely as one has learned it. Brahmā, these are the three forms of worship and service to the Realized One that cannot be surpassed. Even if the Realized One remained for an eon, Brahmā, and he spent the entire eon describing the outcomes of the merit generated by those three forms of worship, he still would not complete the description. Therefore, Brahmā, one who wishes to worship the Realized One with worship and service that cannot be surpassed should perform worship using these three forms of worship. 
{{milestone:{label:25.25,id:UT22084-039-003-1379}}}“If one remembers a single four-line verse from the true Dharma of a single realized one, then, Brahmā, the awakening of the realized ones of the past, present, and future will be retained. The reason for this, Brahmā, is that the awakening of the realized ones is something that arises from the Dharma. Therefore, one should perform worship with the Dharma, and not with material objects. Worship with the true Dharma is said to be supreme among all acts of worship. It is said to be the true form; it is said to be the best.
{{milestone:{label:25.26,id:UT22084-039-003-1380}}}“Brahmā, I remember once upon a time in the past I was born in the palace of a king. At that time I was a young prince named Matimat, and I remembered two verses that I heard in a dream while I was asleep. When I awoke, the thought occurred to me, ‘I have found a great treasure,’ and I blurted out the words ‘I have found a great treasure!’ My parents said, ‘How could a child have found a treasure?’ {{page:{number:205,id:UT22084-039-003-2056,folio:F.202.a}}} Then I spoke these two verses to my parents:
{{milestone:{label:25.27,id:UT22084-039-003-1381}}}“ ‘What the world considers to be great treasures
Can be lost, O King, to thieves, fire, water, and trickery.
Yet, the treasure of hearing the realized ones
Is not lost, even over many millions of eons.
{{milestone:{label:25.28,id:UT22084-039-003-1382}}}“ ‘Constant watchfulness is, indeed, the root of the deathless.
So, too, the aspiration for awakening in one working to benefit beings.
So, too, is the mind, isolated and free, of one who pays careful attention,
While renunciation is the root of all happiness.’{{note:{index:318,id:UT22084-039-003-1383}}}
{{milestone:{label:25.29,id:UT22084-039-003-1384}}}“I heard these two verses in a dream, Brahmā, and with these two verses, Brahmā, I brought eight thousand beings to maturity for the sake of their awakening, and I put forty-two thousand beings on a path to the good places of rebirth. In precisely this manner, Brahmā, you should understand that one obtains a great treasure if one is intent upon learning, and being intent upon it, one practices it correctly, and having become established in its practice, one benefits others.
{{milestone:{label:25.30,id:UT22084-039-003-1385}}}“There are two things, Brahmā, that are of great use on the Great Vehicle: first, not having anger toward any and all beings, and second, not becoming complacent in the search for learning. Those are the two things.
{{milestone:{label:25.31,id:UT22084-039-003-1386}}}“Therefore, Brahmā, ensure that the guiding principles of the Dharma remain unbroken. Request all the realized ones of this Fortunate Eon to teach the Dharma, Brahmā, and remember the true Dharma. When there are such pure beings as those who will arise to become the other blessed buddhas of this Fortunate Eon, Brahmā, you may become indifferent to it. However, during a time such as this one in which beings have afflictions, Brahmā, there will be a great many who hold on to the true Dharma in one aspect or for a single day. In the purified buddha domains, it would not be so, even for hundreds of thousands of eons. Therefore, Brahmā, you should put forth heroic effort so that the true Dharma is remembered in this time of evil.”
{{milestone:{label:25.32,id:UT22084-039-003-1387}}}At this point, the Blessed One spoke to Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, {{page:{number:206,id:UT22084-039-003-2057,folio:F.202.b}}} you must hold on to this teaching, this great mnemonic formula of the nāgas, The Chapter of Vajrapāṇi, The Secret of the Realized Ones, and remember it, recite it, and teach it in full to others. Ānanda, I entrust this formulation of the Dharma to you. Do not explain the secret and inconceivable qualities of the realized ones to common folk, Ānanda, for those beings who are attached to inferior things will be bewildered by it. Ānanda, this formulation of the Dharma is something to which it is quite difficult to become devoted and something that is quite difficult to understand. Only those beings who are well bred and well prepared are worthy recipients of these things. They will have no fear when they hear this series of guiding principles of the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:25.33,id:UT22084-039-003-1388}}}When this had been said, Venerable Ānanda said this to the Blessed One: “I have received this formulation of the Dharma, Blessed One, through the majestic power of the Buddha. Through whose majestic power shall I become capable of retaining it? Please explain this.”
{{milestone:{label:25.34,id:UT22084-039-003-1389}}}“Ānanda,” the Blessed One answered, “do you see these mahāsattvas who have arisen in order to take hold of the true Dharma?”
“I see them, Blessed One.”
{{milestone:{label:25.35,id:UT22084-039-003-1391}}}“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “if you were to teach this formulation of the Dharma to all those beings, it would only be to their benefit.”
{{milestone:{label:25.36,id:UT22084-039-003-1392}}}“Blessed One, what is the name of this formulation of the Dharma? As what should it be remembered?”
“To that end, Ānanda,” the Blessed One answered, “remember this formulation of the Dharma as The Chapter of Vajrapāṇi. Remember it also as The Chapter of the Teaching of the Secrets of the Realized Ones. Remember it also as The Teaching of the Inconceivable Qualities of the Buddhas. Remember it also as The Arising of Immeasurable Merit. Ānanda, if an individual who has been born into the Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas were to remember well this formulation of the Dharma and teach it in full to others with no expectation of reward, {{page:{number:207,id:UT22084-039-003-2058,folio:F.203.a}}} then this individual would gain far more merit than an individual could hope to gain as a result of giving a gift that fills the world with precious jewels from the surface of the ground of the buddha domains up to the highest point of existence, a sight that is seen with the eye of a buddha. That is why this formulation of the Dharma is called both The Chapter of the Teaching of the Secrets of the Realized Ones and The Arising of Immeasurable Merit.”
{{milestone:{label:25.37,id:UT22084-039-003-1394}}}When this chapter on the entrusting of the true Dharma had been taught, ten billion beings conceived the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening, ninety-six thousand bodhisattvas gained the state of acceptance, eighty-four thousand beings attained the pure eye of Dharma in regard to all things, and one thousand six hundred monks were liberated in mind, while an immeasurable number of buddha domains throughout the ten directions shook, and hundreds of thousands of gods played musical instruments and rained down showers of flowers, while proclaiming, “May this formulation of the Dharma remain for a long time in Jambudvīpa!”
{{milestone:{label:25.38,id:UT22084-039-003-1395}}}This is what the Blessed One said, and Vajrapāṇi, Lord of the Guhyakas, the bodhisattva Śāntamati, the god Bhadrarāja, King Ajātaśatru, and the bodhisattvas, the monks, Venerable Ānanda, and the whole world with its gods, human beings, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced at what the Blessed One had said. 
{{milestone:{label:25.39,id:UT22084-039-003-1396}}}This was the twenty-fifth chapter, “Entrusting the True Dharma.”{{note:{index:319,id:UT22084-039-003-1397}}}
{{milestone:{label:25.40,id:UT22084-039-003-1398}}}This concludes “The Chapter of the Teaching the Inconceivable Qualities and Secret of the Realized Ones,” the third of the one hundred thousand chapters of the formulation of the Dharma known as “The Noble Great Heap of Jewels.”
