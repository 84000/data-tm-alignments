Even if they find themselves in the midst of thieves, in the midst of rākṣasas, in the midst of enemies, or in the midst of conflict, their bodies will not be pierced by weapons, they will not be killed by thieves and rākṣasas and the like will not harm them. They will have no fear of dying an untimely death, they will always have good fortune, and all their misdeeds {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-087-002-123,folio:F.158.a}}} will be purified. In a single day, they will come to possess the root of virtue equal to that accumulated by one hundred thousand one hundred million tens of millions of buddhas. When their time of death has come, the buddhas and bodhisattvas will care for them, and, after they die, they will be born in Sukhāvatī.
