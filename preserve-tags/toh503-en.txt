{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-087-008-324}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was wandering through the provinces and came to Vaiśālī. There in Vaiśālī, at the base of the musical tree, he was accompanied by a great saṅgha of eight thousand monks and thirty-six thousand bodhisattvas, including the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva great being Mahāmati, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, the bodhisattva great being Pratibhākūṭa, the bodhisattva great being Amoghavikrāmin, the bodhisattva great being Sudarśana, the bodhisattva great being Sarvata­mondha­kāravidha­mana­mati, the bodhisattva great being Well-Intentioned Thought, the bodhisattva great being Merukūṭa, the bodhisattva great being Gadgadasvara, the bodhisattva great being King Who Holds Great Meru’s Peak, and the bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi. He was surrounded and accompanied by all manner of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, kings, ministers, brahmins, kṣatriyas, and householders. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-087-008-512,folio:F.249.a}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-087-008-325}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-087-008-326}}}The Blessed One was giving a Dharma teaching that was virtuous at the beginning, virtuous in the middle, and virtuous at the end, excellent in meaning, and beautiful in expression. His Dharma talk satisfied beings, made them perfectly happy, and established them in the awakening of a buddha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-087-008-327}}}Then the bodhisattva great being and Dharma prince Mañjuśrī rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe on one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, bowed to the Blessed One with his palms together, and made this request to the Blessed One:

Please teach the names of those thus-gone ones who, simply by hearing them, cause all beings to no longer regress on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening, who purify and utterly exhaust all their misdeeds and karmic obscurations, and that cause them to no longer be crushed by Māra, the wicked one.

Since that is the case, and since you explain and correctly teach how these thus-gone ones first generated the mind of awakening, what their previous aspirations were, and what the arrays of good qualities are in the buddhafields related to these thus-gone ones are,  Blessed One, in order to support all beings in the future during the final five hundred years when the counterfeit holy Dharma has appeared, will the Blessed One please explain the great skillful means of the thus-gone ones and give a detailed account of their previous aspirations?”{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-087-008-513,folio:F.249.b}}}

Mañjuśrī, you are a compassionate being. Mañjuśrī, it is good that the boundless compassion you have generated has led you to make this request to benefit all beings, and so that those gods and humans who are veiled by the various karmic obscurations, whose bodies are tormented by various illnesses, and who are oppressed by various types of mental anguish and suffering might be benefited, helped, and comforted. Mañjuśrī, the Thus-Gone One’s blessing has engendered this eloquent request of yours. So listen well and keep in mind what I say, Mañjuśrī, and I shall explain.”

All the gods, Śakra, and all of the brahmā gods, and the Four Great Kings will protect them. All their karmic obscurations, even down to the five inexpiable acts, will be purified. They will not contract any illnesses, they will have long lives, and they will be free from all fears of dying an untimely death. Threats related to death, enemies, and the wilderness, along with all conflicts, arguments, and disputes, will be pacified. They will not come under their enemies’ control, and their every wish will be fulfilled.”
{{milestone:{label:1.127,id:UT22084-087-008-493}}}Then the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, the lord of the gods, Śakra, and the Four Great Kings bowed to the Blessed One with their hands together and said, “Blessed One, we have heard the detailed account of these thus-gone ones’ previous aspirations. Blessed One, we have actually seen these thus-gone ones and made offerings to them. Blessed One, we and our attendants will go wherever the names of these thus-gone ones and these dhāraṇī verses are practiced. When any son or daughter of good family holds them, recites them, makes offerings to them, writes them down,  and commissions them to be written down, we will be there with them. The blessing of these thus-gone ones will protect any son or daughter of good family and any king or minister who upholds the power of this discourse and writes it down. We will protect their villages, towns, and regions, and we will pacify all manner of threats related to death, enemies, and the wilderness, and all manner of illnesses. Out of our gratitude and love for the thus-gone ones and all beings, we will prevent all manner of untimely death. We will pacify all manner of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, and increase beings’ happiness, wealth, power, riches, and harvests. We will always protect them. Blessed One, a son or daughter of good family should remember that these are our oaths and vows. {{page:{number:48,id:UT22084-087-008-558,folio:F.272.a}}}{{note:{index51,id:UT22084-087-008-494}}}{{note:{index52,id:UT22084-087-008-495}}}

They will never regress on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. They will be reborn in whatever buddhafields they wish, see the thus-gone ones, and remember their past lives. They will attain the absorptions and dhāraṇīs.”
{{milestone:{label:1.130,id:UT22084-087-008-498}}}At that point the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi asked the thus-gone ones,  “Blessed Buddhas, please grant me your permission and I shall pronounce secret dhāraṇī verses for the benefit of those sons and daughters of good family who uphold the power of this discourse.”{{page:{number:49,id:UT22084-087-008-559,folio:F.272.b}}}

Please pronounce the secret dhāraṇī verses so that you may fulfill all your wishes and hopes to benefit those who uphold the power of this discourse.”
{{milestone:{label:1.132,id:UT22084-087-008-500}}}The bodhisattva great being Vajrapāṇi then pronounced the following secret dhāraṇī verses:

I will accomplish all their aims. If they wish to see me, they should commission this Dharma discourse to be written down, make seven statues of these thus-gone ones, and create a bodily representation of the Vajra Bearer. As they pronounce the above dhāraṇī to those thus-gone ones, they should offer perfumes, incense, oil lamps,  garlands, ornaments, songs, instruments, and drums as they circumambulate them and chant these secret dhāraṇī root verses. They should arouse a loving attitude and the intention to benefit all beings. They should maintain the noble eightfold precepts. They should wash themselves three times and change clothes three times. Then, if they recite the vidyāmantra one hundred and eight times each day from the eighth until the full moon on the fifteenth day of the next month, I will grant them a vision in their dreams, instruct them at length, and fulfill all their hopes.”{{page:{number:50,id:UT22084-087-008-560,folio:F.273.a}}}{{note:{index53,id:UT22084-087-008-503}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.136,id:UT22084-087-008-505}}}The thus-gone ones said, “Vajrapāṇi, we bless these secret dhāraṇī root verses so that they may benefit all beings, help them, and fulfill all their hopes.” Then the blessed buddhas summoned Śakra, Brahmā, and the world protectors and said, “Friends, since we have entrusted this great Dharma discourse to you, you must make sure to protect this Dharma discourse—a Dharma discourse that is the same as the thus-gone ones, that purifies all misdeeds, and that fulfills all hopes—so that later, during the final five hundred years,  it will not fall into the hands of beings with little merit, who forsake the holy Dharma, and who denigrate the noble ones, and thus quickly disappear.”{{page:{number:51,id:UT22084-087-008-561,folio:F.273.b}}}

How should it be remembered?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.138,id:UT22084-087-008-507}}}The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, this Dharma discourse should be remembered as The Detailed Account of the Previous Aspirations of the Seven Thus-Gone, Worthy, and Perfect Buddhas. It should also be remembered as The Bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi’s Vow. It should also be remembered as Purifying All Karmic Obscurations and Fulfilling All Hopes. And it should also be remembered as The Vows of the Twelve Great Yakṣa Generals.”
