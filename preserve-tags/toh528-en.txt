Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing near Śrāvastī, in Jeta Grove at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, along with a great congregation of 1,250 monks, many hundreds of thousands of gods and humans, and many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas. Surrounded and venerated by them, he taught the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-088-022-24}}}In a buddhafield one trillion buddhafields away from this buddhafield,  the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, fully and perfectly awakened Buddha Agrapradīpa was residing in the world system named Infinite Flowers. He passed his time there teaching the Dharma. He sent the two great bodhisattvas, Great Light and Amitābha, here to the Sahā world system. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-088-022-25}}}The two bodhisattvas went to Jeta Grove at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, where Śākyamuni, the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, fully and perfectly awakened Buddha was residing. They arrived, respectfully bowed their heads at the Blessed One’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and sat to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-088-022-26}}}Those two bodhisattvas said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, a trillion buddhafields away is the world system named Infinite Flowers, where the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, fully and perfectly awakened Buddha Agrapradīpa resides. He passes his time there teaching the Dharma. The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, fully and perfectly awakened Buddha Agrapradīpa sent us both here to this Sahā world system. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-088-022-119,folio:F.86.a}}} The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, fully and perfectly awakened Buddha Agrapradīpa asks about the Blessed One’s health. Are his illnesses and ailments few? Is he fit, nourished, strong, happy, free of annoyances, and therefore comfortable? 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-088-022-27}}}“He also asks if you are free from any and all of the harms in this world caused by humans, nonhumans, bhūtas, piśācas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, the commander of the kumbhāṇḍa armies,  kings, high-ranking ministers, thieves, snakes, insects, spiders,{{note:{index9,id:UT22084-088-022-28}}} small biting insects,{{note:{index10,id:UT22084-088-022-29}}} and other afflictions.

{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-088-022-34}}}The Blessed One then addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, remember this mantra formula. Receive it, retain it, recite it, and master it.
