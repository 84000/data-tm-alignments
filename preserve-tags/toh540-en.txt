Then, after having snapped the fingers of the left hand three times, one should offer it in a secluded place to all pretas and say the following: “Off with you, you who seek weak points and are looking for an opportunity!{{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-088-035-70}}} I hereby donate food to pretas residing in every world system!” {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-088-035-106,folio:F.101.b}}} One should make the donation before one has eaten. The outcome is that the pretas will each be given a bushel of rice.

Rather, one will possess great might, beauty, a countenance lovely to behold, much wealth, and great enjoyments. One will have a long lifespan, freedom from illness, and will swiftly attain unsurpassed, perfect awakening. After death, one will be reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī.
