After a single reading they will turn their back on cyclic existence for a thousand eons. By merely holding it in their hands they will recall former lives. After a hundred thousand recitations they will become erudite. After two hundred thousand recitations they will become vidyādharas.  After three hundred thousand recitations they will behold the face of Mañjuśrī.
