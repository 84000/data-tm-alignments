{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-089-012-208}}}At that time, there dwelled in the great city of Rājagṛha a bodhisattva mahāsattva by the name of Ruciraketu.

{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-089-012-210}}}The bodhisattva Ruciraketu was staying alone in solitude then, and he was thinking, “Through what causes and through what conditions does the Bhagavat Śākyamuni have such a short lifespan of eighty years?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-089-012-211}}}He also thought, “The Bhagavat has said, ‘There are two causes and two conditions for a long life. What are those two? Not killing beings and giving food and drink to others.’ The Bhagavat Śākyamuni has forsaken killing beings and has practiced the path of the ten good actions for many countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons.  He has always given food and drink to all hungry beings, even satisfying them with his own flesh, blood, bones, legs, and so on, not to mention any other kind of food and drink.”{{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-089-012-3263,folio:F.24.a}}}{{note:{index64,id:UT22084-089-012-212}}}{{note:{index65,id:UT22084-089-012-213}}}

{{milestone:{label:2.5,id:UT22084-089-012-216}}}In the four directions there spontaneously appeared perfect lion thrones made of the four sublime jewels, covered by divine precious cloth.

Those tathāgatas each sat cross-legged on their individual thrones and radiated light rays that spread through and illuminated the great city of Rājagṛha, the trichiliocosm world realm, and throughout as many buddha realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. A rain of divine flowers fell, and the sound of divine music played. At that time, through the power of the Bhagavat’s blessing, all beings in this trichiliocosm world realm experienced perfect bliss and were free of all distress. Those who did not have all their limbs became complete. The blind saw; the deaf heard; the mute spoke; the stupid became wise; those who were disturbed regained their minds; the unclothed became clothed; those who were inferior and derided became respected by others; those with dirty bodies became clean; and extremely wonderful, beneficial things such as had never been seen before appeared in this world realm.{{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-089-012-3264,folio:F.24.b}}}{{note:{index69,id:UT22084-089-012-220}}}

{{milestone:{label:2.8,id:UT22084-089-012-223}}}He also wondered why the Tathāgata Śākyamuni, who possesses limitless qualities, has only the lifespan he has, thinking, “Why does the Tathāgata Śākyamuni, even though he possesses limitless qualities, have such a short life of only eighty years?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.9,id:UT22084-089-012-224}}}The four bhagavats then said to the bodhisattva Ruciraketu, “Noble one, except for we who have unsurpassable omniscience, we do not see any brahmās, māras, mendicants, brahmins, humans, or nonhumans in this world with its devas who can know or calculate the end of the lifespan of the Tathāgata.”{{note:{index71,id:UT22084-089-012-225}}}

{{milestone:{label:31.38,id:UT22084-089-012-3164}}}“Bhagavat, you have taught that 
In the Śrāvakayāna there is lesser wisdom.{{note:{index1261,id:UT22084-089-012-3165}}}
Today, through the power of my own strength,
I will be a protector and holder of this sūtra.
{{milestone:{label:31.39,id:UT22084-089-012-3166}}}“I will give my complete protection
To whoever will be a holder of this sūtra.
I will bestow on them the power of words and eloquence
And I will follow after them, always proclaiming their excellence.”
{{milestone:{label:31.40,id:UT22084-089-012-3167}}}Then Venerable Ānanda placed his palms together and spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:31.41,id:UT22084-089-012-3168}}}“Even though I have heard countless 
Sūtras directly from the Bhagavat,
I have never before heard such 
A supreme king of the Dharma as this.
{{milestone:{label:31.42,id:UT22084-089-012-3169}}}“Today I will completely hold this sūtra
I have heard directly from the Bhagavat,{{note:{index1262,id:UT22084-089-012-3170}}}
And hereafter I will promulgate it widely
Among those who aspire to enlightenment.”
{{milestone:{label:31.43,id:UT22084-089-012-3171}}}Then the Bhagavat, on seeing that the great assembly of bodhisattvas, devas, and humans had each developed the motivation to widely promulgate and spread this sūtra and completely defend it and completely protect it, and that the bodhisattvas were truly inspired and would benefit beings, praised them, saying, “Well done! Well done!  Your single-mindedly promulgating this sublime, supreme king of sūtras widely in this way, so that it will not dissipate and vanish after my nirvāṇa, is the cause of the highest enlightenment. Therefore you will attain all the merit that can be, which could not be fully described even in as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River.{{page:{number:264,id:UT22084-089-012-3517,folio:F.151.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:31.44,id:UT22084-089-012-3172}}}“Any bhikṣu or bhikṣunī, upāsaka or upāsikā, and moreover any noble man or noble woman, and so on, who makes offerings to, honors, writes out, widely promulgates, or teaches this sūtra correctly to others will obtain such merit as that.
“Therefore, you should meditate on this practice with diligence.”
{{milestone:{label:31.45,id:UT22084-089-012-3174}}}Then the great assembly, which was innumerable, incalculable, as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, having heard those words spoken by the Bhagavat, were all completely happy and, obtaining a faith with complete trust, practiced as they had been instructed.{{note:{index1263,id:UT22084-089-012-3175}}}
{{milestone:{label:31.46,id:UT22084-089-012-3176}}}This concludes “The Entrustment,” the thirty-first chapter of “The Supremely Victorious King of Sūtras, the Sublime Golden Light.”
{{milestone:{label:31.47,id:UT22084-089-012-3177}}}The Noble Mahāyāna sūtra “The Supremely Victorious King of Sūtras, the Sublime Golden Light” is concluded.
