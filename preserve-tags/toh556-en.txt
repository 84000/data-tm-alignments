Thus did I hear at one time.{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-089-013-169}}} The Bhagavat was within the profound, completely pure Dharma realm that is the sublime field of activity of the tathāgatas, dwelling at Vulture Peak Mountain at Rājagṛha, together with a saṅgha of ninety-eight thousand{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-089-013-170}}} great bhikṣus. All of them were great arhats, perfectly tamed like the king of elephants. Their defilements had ceased, they were devoid of kleśas, their minds were completely liberated, their wisdom was completely liberated, they had done what had to be done, they had put down their burdens, they had attained their goals, they had cut through engagement with existence, they had attained supreme and sublime power, they had perfectly maintained pure conduct, they were arrayed with methods and wisdom, they had manifested the eight liberations, and they had reached the farther shore.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-089-013-171}}}Their names were Venerable Kauṇḍinya, Venerable Aśvajit, Venerable Vāṣpa, Venerable Mahānāman, Venerable Bhadrika, Venerable Mahākāśyapa, Venerable Uruvilva­kāśyapa, Venerable Gayākāśyapa, Venerable Nadīkāśyapa, Venerable Śāriputra, Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, and Ānanda.

{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-089-013-193}}}Then, during the afternoon, the Bhagavat arose from samādhi, looked upon the multitude that had assembled, and recited these verses:

{{milestone:{label:2,id:UT22084-089-013-chapter-2}}}Chapter 2: The Teaching of the Lifespan of the Tathāgata
{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-089-013-226}}}Also, at that time, there dwelled in the great city of Rājagṛha a bodhisattva mahāsattva by the name of Ruciraketu. He had served past jinas, had developed roots of merit, and had attended{{note:{index:47,id:UT22084-089-013-227}}} upon many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhas. He thought, “Through what causes and what conditions does the Bhagavat Śākyamuni have such a short lifespan of eighty years?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-089-013-228}}}Then he thought, “The Bhagavat has said, ‘There are two causes and two conditions for a long life. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-089-013-2960,folio:F.155.b}}} What are those two? Forsaking killing and giving food.’ The Bhagavat Śākyamuni has forsaken killing and has correctly adopted{{note:{index:48,id:UT22084-089-013-229}}} the path of the ten good actions for countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons. He has given external and internal substances as food to beings, even to the extent{{note:{index:49,id:UT22084-089-013-230}}} of satisfying hungry beings with his own body, blood, bones, and limbs, to say nothing of every other kind of food.”
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-089-013-231}}}When that sublime being’s mind had thought that, with his attention focused upon the Buddha, his house became immense, vast, and made of blue beryl. It was adorned with many divine jewels, its color transformed by the Tathāgata,{{note:{index:50,id:UT22084-089-013-232}}} and it was pervaded by a perfume that transcended the divine. 
{{milestone:{label:2.4,id:UT22084-089-013-233}}}In the four directions of that house there appeared four thrones made of divine jewels. The thrones were overspread with layers{{note:{index:51,id:UT22084-089-013-234}}} of precious, divine cloth decorated with divine jewels.{{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-089-013-235}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.5,id:UT22084-089-013-236}}}Upon those{{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-089-013-237}}} thrones appeared divine lotus flowers, their colors transformed by the Tathāgata,{{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-089-013-238}}} and adorned by many jewels. Upon those lotuses there appeared the four buddha bhagavats. To the east appeared the Tathāgata Akṣobhya. To the south appeared the Tathāgata Ratnaketu. To the west appeared the Tathāgata Amitābha. To the north appeared the Tathāgata Dundubhisvara. At the moment when those buddha bhagavats appeared upon those lion thrones, the great city of Rājagṛha was filled by a great illuminating light. That light spread throughout the trichiliocosm world realm, throughout as many world realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. A rain of flowers fell. There came the sound of divine music. {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-089-013-2961,folio:F.156.a}}} Through the power of the Buddha, all beings in this trichiliocosm world realm gained divine happiness. Those who had incomplete faculties gained all their faculties. The blind saw forms with their eyes; the deaf heard sounds with their ears; the insane gained their sanity; those with distracted{{note:{index:55,id:UT22084-089-013-239}}} minds became undistracted; the naked became clothed; the hungry had their stomachs filled; the thirsty found drink;{{note:{index:56,id:UT22084-089-013-240}}} beings afflicted by illness were healed; and those with impaired physical faculties became possessed of complete faculties. In those worlds there appeared vast, astonishing, wonderful qualities.
{{milestone:{label:2.6,id:UT22084-089-013-241}}}The bodhisattva{{note:{index:57,id:UT22084-089-013-242}}} Ruciraketu was amazed to see those buddha bhagavats, and, filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased, and happy, with his palms together in homage, he bowed toward those buddha bhagavats. Mindful of those buddha bhagavats and mindful of the qualities of the Buddha Bhagavat Śākyamuni, he had doubts concerning the lifespan of the Bhagavat Śākyamuni. In his mind was the thought, “Why is it that the Bhagavat Śākyamuni has this short lifespan of eighty years?”
{{milestone:{label:2.7,id:UT22084-089-013-243}}}Those buddha bhagavats were aware of and understood these thoughts and said to the bodhisattva Ruciraketu, “Noble one, do not think, ‘The Bhagavat Śākyamuni has such a short lifespan.’ Why is that? Noble one, except for the tathāgata arhat samyaksaṃbuddhas, {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-089-013-2962,folio:F.156.b}}} we do not see anyone within the world with its devas, with its Māra, with its Brahmā, with its many beings who are mendicants and brahmins, and with its devas, humans, and asuras who has the ability to know the Bhagavat Tathāgata Śākyamuni’s lifespan to its future limit.”
{{milestone:{label:2.8,id:UT22084-089-013-244}}}As soon as those buddha bhagavats described the Tathāgata’s lifespan, at that moment, through the power of the buddhas, the devas in the desire realm, the devas in the form realm, the nāgas, the yakṣas, the gandharvas, the asuras, the garuḍas, the kinnaras, the mahoragas, and the many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of assembled bodhisattvas arrived in the house of the bodhisattva Ruciraketu. 
{{milestone:{label:2.9,id:UT22084-089-013-245}}}Those tathāgatas then recited verses that taught in brief the length of the lifespan of the Bhagavat Śākyamuni to that complete assembly:
{{milestone:{label:2.10,id:UT22084-089-013-246}}}“The drops of water in all

{{milestone:{label:2.18,id:UT22084-089-013-258}}}Then the bodhisattva Ruciraketu, having heard that teaching on the lifespan of Bhagavat Śākyamuni, asked those bhagavats, “Why is it that the Bhagavat Śākyamuni, the Tathāgata, manifests such a short lifespan?”
{{milestone:{label:2.19,id:UT22084-089-013-259}}}The bhagavats said to the bodhisattva Ruciraketu, “The Bhagavat Śākyamuni, the Tathāgata, has been born at a time when beings could live for a hundred years in a world that has the five degenerations. Therefore, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni has manifested a short lifespan in order to benefit beings with inferior aspiration, beings with little roots of merit and faith, and ordinary foolish beings who have the view that there is a being, the view that there is a soul, the view that there is a spirit, the view that there is an individual, erroneous views, the belief in ‘me’ and ‘mine,’ the views of eternalism and nihilism, and so on. It is also to inspire the true view in tīrthikas so that they will quickly attain the highest enlightenment.
{{milestone:{label:2.20,id:UT22084-089-013-260}}}“Moreover, noble one, the Tathāgata, by manifesting passing into nirvāṇa, causes beings to perceive him as rare and difficult to meet; causes them to perceive misery, suffering, and so on; and inspires them to quickly obtain, possess, read, comprehend, and teach widely to others these sūtras that have been taught by the Buddha Bhagavat, and to not malign them. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-089-013-2964,folio:F.157.b}}} That is why the Tathāgata manifests a short lifespan. If the Tathāgata were always present and did not pass into nirvāṇa, beings would have no reverence—they would not perceive him as being difficult to meet, and they would not obtain, possess, read, comprehend, and teach widely to others these sūtras that have been taught by the Tathāgata. Why is that? Because they would believe that the Bhagavat would always remain in the world. 
{{milestone:{label:2.21,id:UT22084-089-013-261}}}“As an analogy, noble one, someone who sees that his parents have many precious jewels would not perceive that wealth as being rare or wonderful. Why is that? It is because he perceives that his parents’ wealth will always be present. In the same way, if the Bhagavat never passed into nirvāṇa, he would not be perceived as rare and difficult to meet.
{{milestone:{label:2.22,id:UT22084-089-013-262}}}“Moreover, noble one, as another analogy, if someone who had poor parents, who had no wealth, went to the dwelling of a king or great minister and saw their vast, numerous treasuries, wealth, jewels and so on, he would perceive them as rare and difficult to obtain, and he would dedicate himself to accomplishing the methods for seeking wealth, because he would wish to leave poverty behind and to accomplish happiness and prosperity. 
{{milestone:{label:2.23,id:UT22084-089-013-263}}}“In the same way, noble one, if the Tathāgata is seen to pass into nirvāṇa, there will be the perception of how rare and difficult he is to meet, and the perception of misery and suffering. The Bhagavat Tathāgata only appears a few times in countless eons, just as a fig tree flower hardly ever appears, just a few times, so that beings will perceive him as rare and difficult to meet, and they will have veneration for him, perceive the sūtras he teaches to be the truth, {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-089-013-2965,folio:F.158.a}}} and perceive them as something to be possessed and not to be maligned.

{{milestone:{label:3.47,id:UT22084-089-013-430}}}“Because the bhūmi of the tathāgatas has three purities it is called the perfectly pure. What are those three? Being pure of kleśas, being pure of suffering, and being pure of characteristics. This is like when good gold has been smelted and treated so that it is purified, is subsequently unstained by dirt and impurities, and its natural purity has appeared. It is not that the pure substance of gold had not existed.

{{milestone:{label:3.49,id:UT22084-089-013-432}}}“As another analogy, the element of space becomes pure when the sky is not obscured by smoke, clouds, dust, or mist, but it’s not that space was not present. In the same way, the Dharma body is pure when all the kleśas have ceased, {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-089-013-2988,folio:F.169.b}}} but it’s not that the Dharma body was not present. 
{{milestone:{label:3.50,id:UT22084-089-013-433}}}“Also, as a further analogy, someone in a dream who is swept away by a great river uses their body, legs, and arms, and with physical and mental effort reaches the far shore. On waking from that dream, the river and its banks are seen to not have separate existences, but it is not that the mind that dreamed them was not present. 
{{milestone:{label:3.51,id:UT22084-089-013-434}}}“The mind is purified when thoughts of saṃsāra cease, but it is not that buddhahood was not present.

{{milestone:{label:3.52,id:UT22084-089-013-435}}}“Also, noble one, through the Dharma body being purified of the kleśa obscurations, the enjoyment body appears. Through being purified of karma obscurations, the emanation body appears. Through being purified of that which obscures wisdom, the Dharma body appears. As an analogy, from the empty sky there appears lightning; from lightning there appears light. In the same way, the enjoyment body appears from the Dharma body, and the emanation body appears from the enjoyment body. The Dharma body appears because of its pure nature. The enjoyment body appears because of pure wisdom. The emanation body appears because of pure samādhi. 
{{milestone:{label:3.53,id:UT22084-089-013-436}}}“The purity of those three is the true nature of the Dharma body—the true nature that is not anything else, the true nature of one taste, the true nature of liberation, the true nature of infinity—and therefore there is no difference in the bodies of the buddhas.

Why is that? Because the true nature of phenomena is seen correctly, so that the buddhas also see all the tathāgatas. Why is that? Because such ārya individuals as the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have renounced the three realms and seek the ultimate conclusion are unable to see that true nature. Because they do not see it, childlike ordinary beings become polluted by error and, through having incorrect thoughts, are unable to know it.

However, it is the realm of activity of the tathāgatas who have attained, without conceptualization, great power over all phenomena and possess profound, pure wisdom. They are not the same as others. Therefore, the buddha bhagavats, having endured hardships for countless, innumerable eons without care for their body or life, have attained the bodies that are sublime and supreme, are unsurpassable and inconceivable, are beyond the scope of words and speech, are complete peace, and are free from all fears.

They do not give unexamined teachings. The buddha bhagavats carry out all four kinds of physical actions with wisdom. They have compassion for all phenomena. They care for the happiness and benefit of all beings.

{{milestone:{label:4.1,id:UT22084-089-013-458}}}The bodhisattva Ruciraketu then went to sleep and in a dream saw a golden drum{{note:{index:84,id:UT22084-089-013-459}}} that was shining like the disk of the sun. In all directions there were countless, innumerable buddha bhagavats seated upon precious beryl thrones at the foot of precious wish-fulfilling trees, encircled by assemblies of many hundreds of thousands. Looking straight ahead, they were teaching the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:4.2,id:UT22084-089-013-460}}}Then he saw a person who appeared to be a brahmin beating that drum, and he heard a teaching in verse come from the drumbeats.
{{milestone:{label:4.3,id:UT22084-089-013-461}}}As soon as the bodhisattva Ruciraketu awoke from his sleep, he remembered the verses that were taught. Having remembered them, when the night was over, he left the city of Rājagṛha, and together with many thousands of people he went to Vulture Peak Mountain and into the presence of the Bhagavat. He bowed down to the feet of the Bhagavat and circumambulated the Bhagavat three times, keeping him to his right, and then sat down to one side.

However, one cannot say it is the five skandhas and one cannot say it is not the five skandhas. If the Dharma realm itself were the five skandhas, that would be nihilism. If one were to state that it is other than the five skandhas, that would be eternalism. It is devoid of both characteristics. It does not dwell in either of the two extremes. It cannot be viewed; it transcends being an object of view. It has no name or feature. That is what is called the Dharma realm.
{{milestone:{label:10.11,id:UT22084-089-013-1074}}}“Family goddess, why are the five skandhas called the Dharma realm? The five skandhas are not produced through causes and conditions.

If they were a production of what has already been produced, it is logical that causes and conditions would not be needed. If they were that which is not produced that is being produced, then there would be no perceivable production. Why is that?

That which does not go anywhere is neither eternal nor nothingness. It is neither one nor separate. Why is that? If the five skandhas were one with the Dharma realm, they would not be different from the Dharma realm.

It has no name or features. It has no cause or condition. It cannot be taught through examples. It is devoid of a beginning or an end. It is naturally empty.
