{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-090-003-39}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Jetavana at Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove in Śrāvastī. At that time, there was also a tender, young, a monk named Svāti staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove of Jetavana in Śrāvastī. It had not been long since he had set forth, was ordained, and entered the teachings and monastic discipline. While he was gathering wood for the saṅgha’s steam bath–house, a large black snake emerged from the hollow of a rotten log and bit him on the big toe of his right foot. His body went weak, and he collapsed onto the ground. He lay there with his eyes rolled back, vomiting foam. Venerable Ānanda saw the monk Svāti lying there collapsed on the ground, afflicted, suffering, and extremely ill, with his eyes rolled back, vomiting foam. Witnessing this, he rushed to the Blessed One, bowed at his feet, and stood to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-090-003-40}}}Standing to one side, Venerable Ānanda asked, “Venerable Blessed One! Here at Jetavana, at Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove in Śrāvastī, there is a tender, young monk named Svāti. It has not been long since he set forth, was ordained, and entered the teachings and monastic discipline. He was gathering wood for the saṅgha’s steam bath–house when a large black snake emerged from the hollow of a rotten log and bit him on the big toe of his right foot. His body went weak, he collapsed to the ground and curled up, and he is lying there with his eyes rolled back, vomiting foam. Venerable Blessed One! How should I treat him?” {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-090-003-1750,folio:F.89.a}}}
