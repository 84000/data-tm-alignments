{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-090-009-70}}}This is the ritual manual of The Dhāraṇī of the Goddess Mārīcī that was received by Vairocana’s great king.{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-090-009-71}}} Visualize Mārīcī on a sun and moon disk. Imagine a needle and thread emerge before her out of her rays and sew shut the mouths and eyes of wicked beings. Set up a boundary to any external observation and imagine, while reciting the “was dwelling in Śrāvastī” line, that the goddess Mārīcī emerges in her complete form from the light of the sun and moon.{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-090-009-72}}} Continue, saying, “ ‘There is a certain goddess named Mārīcī,’ the Victor said, ‘who arrives just before the sun and moon, but even the many hordes of gods cannot see her.’ ” Then, continue to where it says, “ ‘may I, too, not be seen,’ ” and so forth. Those are the three sets of nine.{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-090-009-73}}} The mantra verse is recited as follows: oṃ padākramasi{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-090-009-74}}} parākramasi udayamasi pudamasi nairamasi antardhānamasi. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-090-009-75}}}One can add a specific name to the section that reads, “Goddess Mārīcī, protect me on the path. Protect me from the wrong path. Protect me from perils involving kings, fire, enemies, and lions. Always bring me profit and success. namo ratnatrayāya oṃ ālo kālo tālo sacchalo saṁmurti rakṣa rakṣa māṃ sarvabhayeṣu svāhā.

{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-090-009-78}}}The forty-four-syllable invocation is the names of the three oceans, the heart mantra with the syllable oṃ, and the twenty-two and the six-syllable mantras.{{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-090-009-79}}} It offers protection from all manner of perils.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-090-009-80}}}If one bears this heart mantra in mind, one will have a keen intellect. When this mantra is recited along with the introductory verses, she grants boons such as increasing one’s wealth, stores of grain, and attendants. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-090-009-81}}}To that end, someone who wants to perform the sādhana should draw her image on a canvas or wooden board. Draw Aśokamārīcī seated on a lotus at the base of an aśoka tree adorned with all her ornaments. She is yellow and wears a blue upper garment and shawl.{{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-090-009-82}}} Her head is crowned with a caitya, she is youthful, and her eyes look to the left. Following the aforementioned ritual procedure, gaze at the painting in front of you while reciting the heart mantra of the supreme sādhana, oṃ mārīcyai svāhā, one thousand times. This supreme heart mantra will certainly grant the highest siddhi, eliminate all fevers, and eliminate all illnesses. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-090-009-83}}}Reciting the mantra along with a fire offering causes Mārīcī to increase one’s wealth. A fire offering of yogurt and dūrvā grass eliminates illness. A fire offering of honey and ghee enthralls kings. A fire offering of yogurt, rice, and molasses allows one to acquire a yakṣiṇī. One thousand fire offerings of mustard oil and leafy neem branches eliminates fever and illnesses. One should perform one thousand fire offerings using one’s own blood, a bone, poison,{{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-090-009-84}}} and black mustard, and the enemy will die. Perform the fire offering with milk, and it will be pacified.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-090-009-85}}}If one recites the mantra continually, it neutralizes poison and easily subdues ḍākinīs. If one recites it one hundred and eight times each day one will develop a keen intellect.

Then one should imagine oneself in space in the form of Vairocana seated on a teakwood throne in the center of a lotus with legs crossed in the vajra posture. He has a golden complexion and bears the hand mudrā of supreme awakening. He has attained meditative concentration, wears a crown of matted locks, and is peaceful.

{{milestone:{label:1.75,id:UT22084-090-009-195}}}After that, he should add the names of the king and royal priest who are the target of the mantra and write them on a piece of birch bark or cloth using red saffron or bovine bezoar. He should encircle it with the syllable māṃ, surround that with the four syllables oṃ, māṃ, vāṃ, and māṃ, and draw the mantra wheel surrounded on the outside by the letter va. If he touches the troops with this on the crown or throat, they will be protected in everything they do. When they go to battle, no weapon will pierce {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-090-009-358,folio:F.162.b}}} their bodies, and they will win the battle. 
{{milestone:{label:1.76,id:UT22084-090-009-196}}}Then the vajrācārya should mount the lead elephant or the lead chariot, face the battlefield, and hoist a yellow victory banner over an unfurled painting of Blessed Mārīcī.

{{milestone:{label:1.79,id:UT22084-090-009-201}}}This mantra wheel should be drawn with a liquid made of yellow arsenic or turmeric on a piece of cloth from the corpse of a person who was slain in battle or on a piece of cloth from a charnel ground. An effigy of the enemy’s general should be fashioned out of soil from both sides of a riverbank or soil from a mountaintop mixed with ash from a charnel ground and placed in the center of the mantra wheel. The image of a wild boar should be drawn using the same soil mixed with a liquid base of rice and turmeric, and the effigy of the enemy should be placed face down in the boar’s mouth. The boar should be placed inside of a vessel with a lid and left there, situated so that it faces the enemy army.

He should make a circle between those two with the mantra garland that begins with vattāli, surround that with the syllable māṃ, and surround it again with the four syllables. He should mark the edge of the square boundary with vajras, and it will instantly paralyze and weaken the enemy army—let there be no doubt. This mantra wheel called supreme victory over the enemy army{{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-090-009-359,folio:F.163.a}}} should be learned from an ācārya’s instructions.
{{milestone:{label:1.81,id:UT22084-090-009-203}}}The following is another mantra wheel for performing paralyzing rites, rites to sow discord, and killing rites for protecting one’s close allies and getting rid of people who create obstacles. The wise one should prepare a spot in a charnel ground, carefully unfurl the painting, and make a maṇḍala of cow dung in front of it. The wrathful one should perform an offering using the five prescribed offerings, put on a black robe, wear a black turban, clasp the ritual implements, vajra, and bell, and visualize himself as Mārīcī as before. 
{{milestone:{label:1.82,id:UT22084-090-009-204}}}He should imagine himself as Mārīcī with three boar faces that have three eyes and bare their fangs.

She holds an arrow, vajra, needle, and hook in her right hands and a bow, noose, aśoka branch, and thread in her left hands. The hair on her head is like a caitya.

Or he can face the battlefield and perform a fire offering and mantra recitation with a mixture of ground human bone and human fat, and the enemy’s forces will instantly be paralyzed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.86,id:UT22084-090-009-210}}}Another application of the mantra is as follows: If he wants to pacify jackals that are threatening livestock, he should go to the cattle pasture and write the mantra clearly on the arch of the pasture gate.

Then he should hang the mantra wheel on the bull’s horns and around the herders’ necks. He should make the mantra wheel with the syllables oṃ, māṃ, vāṃ, and māṃ surrounded by the syllable va and then surrounded by the syllable cyai. It should be encircled on the outside with the syllable māṃ.

{{milestone:{label:1.88,id:UT22084-090-009-212}}}That is the dagger mantra for dispelling vighnas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.89,id:UT22084-090-009-213}}}After that, the wise one should carefully unfurl the painting of Blessed Mārīcī in the middle of the cattle pen so that it is facing east.
