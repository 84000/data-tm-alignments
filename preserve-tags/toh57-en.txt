Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-041-002-87}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was staying together with an immense assembly of monks{{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-041-002-88}}} at the Nyagrodha pleasure grove in the city of Kapilavastu. At that time, the Bhagavān’s younger brother named Nanda, who had a golden complexion, was endowed with the thirty marks,{{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-041-002-89}}} and was four finger-widths shorter than the Bhagavān, had a wife called Sundarikā.{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-041-002-90}}} She was a good lady, pleasant to behold, with a beautiful figure and a superior complexion rare in the world. Since everyone wished to look at her, Nanda, because he desired and was obsessed with her, did not leave her alone even for a moment. Due to his lustful mind, he became very attached and considered her as valuable as his own life.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-041-002-91}}}The Bhagavān, knowing that the time had come to tame Nanda, dressed early in the morning, took his bowl, and, with the venerable Ānanda as his attendant, went to the city to collect alms. In due course, they arrived at the place where Nanda’s house was, and going to the door, they stood there. Then, by the power of great compassion, the Bhagavān emitted a golden light, and the entire interior of Nanda’s house turned the color of refined gold.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-041-002-92}}}At that time, Nanda thought, “Since this light is all-illuminating, it must undoubtedly be the Tathāgata’s.” Thinking this, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-041-002-674,folio:F.206.a}}} he dispatched a man, ordering him, “Go see who it is.”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-041-002-93}}}The man, seeing the Bhagavān, hastened back and told Nanda, “The Bhagavān is at the door.”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-041-002-94}}}When Nanda heard that, he quickly went out and greeted the Bhagavān. After Nanda paid obeisance, at that time Sundarikā thought, “If I let Nanda go, he will doubtlessly go forth because of the Bhagavān.” Grabbing Nanda by the edge of his garment, she did not let go. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-041-002-95}}}“Now let go for a minute,” said Nanda. “I will pay obeisance to the Bhagavān, and then I’ll come back.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-041-002-96}}}“First, let’s make an agreement; then I’ll let you go,” said Sundarikā. She put the mark of a wet tilaka on his forehead, and she said, “Please return before this tilaka is dry. If you are delayed, there will be a penalty of five hundred gold kārṣāpanas.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-041-002-97}}}“I will do so,” said Nanda. Going out the door, he bowed down at the Bhagavān’s feet. He took the Tathāgata’s bowl and went back into the house. After filling the bowl with good food, Nanda again went out the door. Since the Bhagavān had returned to the monastery, he offered it to Ānanda. But the Bhagavān had indicated that Ānanda should not take the bowl. Because of the overwhelming majesty of the Tathāgata, the Great Teacher, Nanda did not have the confidence to offer it to him with the words, “Please receive this,” so he again offered it to Ānanda. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-041-002-98}}}Ānanda asked, “From whom did you receive this bowl?” 
“I received it from the Bhagavān.”
“In that case, offer it to the Bhagavān,” said Ānanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-041-002-101}}}Nanda answered, “I don’t have the confidence to offer it to the Great Teacher.” Saying nothing, he left following after him.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-041-002-102}}}When the Bhagavān had returned to the monastery, he washed his hands, bathed his feet, and sat on his cushion. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-041-002-675,folio:F.206.b}}} Nanda held up the Bhagavān’s bowl and offered it to him. When the Bhagavān finished eating, he asked Nanda, “Will you eat what is left in my bowl?”
“Yes, please,” he answered, and the Bhagavān gave it to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-041-002-104}}}Nanda finished eating, and the Bhagavān asked, “Will you go forth?”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-041-002-105}}}Nanda answered, “I will go forth.” Furthermore, because the Bhagavān Buddha, when he engaged in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, never opposed the instructions of his parents, preceptors, teachers, or other gurus, he had now attained the state in which nothing he said was opposed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-041-002-106}}}Then the Bhagavān said to Ānanda, “Shave Nanda’s hair and beard.” 
“As the Bhagavān wishes,” replied Ānanda, and he searched for a barber. 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-041-002-108}}}As soon as the barber began cutting Nanda’s hair, Nanda said to him, “Hey! Don’t you know? It won’t be long before I become a powerful cakravartin. If you shave my hair and beard, I will cut off both your hands!” Intimidated, the barber became very frightened, and he put away his razor and started to leave. Then the venerable Ānanda told the Bhagavān what had happened.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-041-002-109}}}The Bhagavān went to Nanda and asked, “Will you not go forth?” 
Nanda answered, “I will go forth.” The Bhagavān then took a vase and poured water on Nanda’s head, and the barber shaved Nanda’s hair and beard. Nanda thought, “I will honor the Buddha for now and go forth, but I will return home in the evening.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-041-002-111}}}In the evening, Nanda took to the road and left. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-041-002-676,folio:F.207.a}}} When Nanda saw a great chasm conjured by the Bhagavān ahead of him on the road, he thought, “As for the time agreed upon with Sundarikā, since I am still far away, I have no possibility of arriving on time. Now, it is possible that I will die from just thinking about her. If I do not die, I will go tomorrow morning.” He passed the night in suffering and misery due to yearning for Sundarikā.
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-041-002-112}}}Knowing what Nanda was thinking, the Bhagavān said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and order Nanda to act as caretaker in the monastery.” Ānanda accordingly went directly to Nanda.
Ānanda told him, “The Bhagavān orders you to be the caretaker.”
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-041-002-114}}}Nanda asked, “What duties does a ‘caretaker’ perform?”
“He must supervise the monks’ chores in the monastery,” said Ānanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-041-002-116}}}Nanda asked, “In what way should he work?”
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-041-002-117}}}“As for the caretaker,” answered Ānanda, “when the monks go out for alms, he must sweep the monastery grounds and sprinkle them with water. He must take fresh cow dung and gently spread it in the proper way. Paying careful attention, he should guard against loss. If any advice is necessary, he should ask the monks. If there is incense and flowers, he should distribute them to the monks. He should close the gates at night and open them in the morning. He must always clean and wipe down the toilet and urinal. If something in the monastery falls apart, he must repair it well.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-041-002-118}}}Nanda, having heard the explanation, accepted it, saying, “Venerable Ānanda, I shall do everything according to the Bhagavān’s command.”
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-041-002-119}}}The next morning, the monks put on their lower robes, took their upper robes and bowls, and left for the city of Kapilavastu on their alms round. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-041-002-677,folio:F.207.b}}} Nanda, seeing that nobody was in the monastery, thought, “As soon as I finish sweeping, I’ll go back home,” and did the sweeping. The Bhagavān saw him and knew, so, with his supernormal abilities, he cast a spell so that the clean ground that had been swept was again full of rubbish. Nanda then thought, “I’ll throw away the rubbish and go back home.” He put the broom down and began to throw away the rubbish, but, since it was never-ending, he thought, “I will close the doors of the dwelling places and leave.” He began to close the doors of the dwelling places, but the Bhagavān cast a spell so that as soon as Nanda closed one door, another door would open. That troubled Nanda, and he had this thought: “Even if a thief harms this monastery, whatever damage there is, when I become king, I will build a hundred thousand excellent monasteries much greater than this one. As for me, I’ll go back home.” And then he thought, “If I stay on the main road, I’m afraid I’ll meet the Bhagavān, so I’ll take a side road.”
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-041-002-120}}}The Bhagavān, knowing what Nanda was thinking, took that very same shortcut. Nanda, seeing the Bhagavān from a distance, hid near a tree at the side of the road that had shady branches hanging down, in order to avoid him. The Bhagavān cast a spell to make the tree lift up its branches and show Nanda’s body. 
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-041-002-121}}}Then the Bhagavān called out, “Nanda, where are you going? Come along after me!” Ashamed and embarrassed, Nanda followed in attendance upon him. The Bhagavān thought, “Since Nanda is very attached to his wife and is obsessed with her, in order to help him separate from her I will leave Kapilavastu {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-041-002-678,folio:F.208.a}}} and go to Śrāvastī.” Thinking in this way, he went there and stayed at Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā’s{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-041-002-122}}} pleasure grove.{{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-041-002-123}}} Then the Bhagavān thought, “Since this foolish Nanda is continually attached to his wife and obsessed with her, he will not let go of her, so I must apply skillful means and pacify his mind.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-041-002-124}}}Thinking in this way, the Bhagavān asked the venerable Nanda, “In the past, have you ever seen Mount Gandhamādana?” 
“I haven’t seen it,” answered Nanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-041-002-126}}}“If that is so, grab the corner of my robe.” Nanda grabbed the corner of his garment. The Bhagavān then soared up into the sky like the king of geese. When he arrived at Mount Gandhamādana together with the venerable Nanda, they looked right and left. Under a tree, a blind, one-eyed female monkey raised her face and intently looked right at the Bhagavān. The Bhagavān asked Nanda, “Do you see this blind monkey?” 
“Yes, I see her,” answered Nanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-041-002-128}}}“What do you think?” asked the Bhagavān. “If you compare this blind monkey to Sundarikā, which one is more beautiful and exalted?”
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-041-002-129}}}“Sundarikā is a Śākya,” said Nanda. “She is like a young goddess. Her face is the best; she is peerless in the world. Therefore, if you compare her to this monkey, the monkey does not come close to being one-hundredth, one-thousandth, one-ten-thousandth, or one-hundred-thousandth of Sundarikā. Any number, fraction, calculation, example, or comparison would be inadequate.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-041-002-130}}}The Bhagavān asked, “Have you ever seen the heavenly palaces?”
“No, I haven’t seen them,” answered Nanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-041-002-132}}}“Well then, grab the corner of my robe again.” Again Nanda grabbed the garment, and the Bhagavān rose up into the sky like the king of geese and went to the abode of the Thirty-Three Gods. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-041-002-679,folio:F.208.b}}} The Bhagavān said, “Nanda, go and look at the heavenly palaces, which are exalted dwellings.” The venerable Nanda went to the pleasure groves of the gods such as Nandana Grove, Caitraratha Grove, Pāruṣyaka Grove, Miśrakā Grove, Pārijāta Grove, and Sudharmā Hall, and places of play and delight with flowers, fruit, ponds, and pools. When he had seen everything, he eventually entered the city Sudarśana. Elsewhere, pleasant sounds came forth from drums, lutes, and various types of stringed instruments. And here and there, he saw very beautiful young goddesses and gods nestled, playing together.
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-041-002-133}}}Nanda, after searching all over, saw that there were only young goddesses but no young gods in a certain palace, and he asked those young goddesses, “Why, in other places, do young goddesses and gods live together and experience pleasure, while in your case, only young goddesses live together, and young gods are not to be seen?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-041-002-134}}}Those young goddesses said, “There is a younger brother of the Bhagavān, Nanda, who went forth under the Bhagavān and intently and properly practices pure behavior. After he passes away, he will be reborn here. We will wait for him here.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-041-002-135}}}Nanda, having heard this, rejoiced and quickly hurried to where the Bhagavān was. The Bhagavān asked, “Did you see the exalted circumstances of the gods?”
“Yes, I saw them,” said Nanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-041-002-137}}}The Bhagavān asked, “What circumstances did you see?”
Nanda told the Bhagavān in detail everything that he had seen.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-041-002-139}}}The Bhagavān {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-041-002-680,folio:F.209.a}}} asked, “Did you see the young goddesses?”
“Yes, I saw them,” said Nanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-041-002-141}}}The Bhagavān asked, “If you compare those young goddesses to Sundarikā, who is more physically beautiful and exalted?”
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-041-002-142}}}“Bhagavān,” replied Nanda, “if I compared Sundarikā with those young goddesses, it would be just like comparing the blind female monkey of Mount Gandhamādana to Sundarikā. She does not come close to being one-hundredth, one-thousandth, one-ten-thousandth, or one-hundred-thousandth as good as them, up to any comparison would be inadequate.”
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-041-002-143}}}The Bhagavān said, “Nanda, since you will have such exalted benefits if you properly practice pure behavior, you should now firmly practice pure behavior, and when you are reborn as a god, you will experience such pleasure.” Nanda heard what the Bhagavān said, rejoiced, and sat silently. Then the Bhagavān, together with the venerable Nanda, disappeared from the realm of the gods and went to the Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, in Śrāvastī. The venerable Nanda then properly practiced pure behavior while thinking about the heavenly palaces.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-041-002-144}}}The Bhagavān, knowing what Nanda was thinking, told the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go tell the monks, ‘Do not sit on the same seat together with Nanda. Do not walk on the same path. Do not hang your robes on the same peg. Do not put your begging bowl and water vessel in the same place. Do not read sūtras aloud in the same place. Do not recite in the same place.’ ” The venerable Ānanda instructed the monks according to what the Bhagavān had told him, and the monks said, “We will do as the Noble One says.”
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-041-002-145}}}At that time, the venerable Nanda, seeing that the many monks had shunned him, felt very embarrassed and guilty. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-041-002-681,folio:F.209.b}}} After that, on another occasion, the venerable Ānanda was sewing robes in the assembly hall together with the many monks. When Nanda saw this, he thought, “These many monks have shunned me and will not keep company with me. Since the venerable Ānanda is my brother, there is no way that he would show contempt for me.” Thinking in this way, he went to Ānanda and sat down next to him. Then Ānanda quickly got up and left.
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-041-002-146}}}Nanda said, “Ānanda, it is reasonable for the other monks to shun me, but if you are my brother, why do you shun me?”
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-041-002-147}}}“This may be true,” replied the venerable Ānanda, “but you are walking one path, and I am walking another path, so we should therefore avoid each other.”
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-041-002-148}}}“What is my path? What is your path?” asked Nanda.
Ānanda answered, “You practice pure behavior due to a desire for birth in heaven. I remove desires and defilements for the sake of seeking nirvāṇa.” Nanda heard what Ānanda said and became very unhappy and oppressed by sorrow. 
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-041-002-150}}}Then the Bhagavān, knowing what he was thinking, asked the venerable Nanda, “Have you ever seen hell beings?”
“No, I haven’t,” answered Nanda.
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-041-002-152}}}The Bhagavān said, “Grab the corner of my robe.” Again, Nanda grabbed the garment, and the Bhagavān led him to the abodes of hell beings. The Bhagavān sat to one side and said to the venerable Nanda, “Go look at the hell beings!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-041-002-153}}}The venerable Nanda went accordingly, and first he saw the Vaitaraṇī River. Then he went successively to Sword-Leaf Forest, Excrement Swamp, and Pit of Burning Embers. He entered those places and, looking all around, {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-041-002-682,folio:F.210.a}}} saw the various sufferings the many beings there experienced. For some, tongues, teeth, and eyes were torn out with pliers. For some, the body was cut with a saw. For some, the arms and legs were cut off by an ax. Some were struck with weapons like spears, double-bladed battle axes, and rods. Some were smashed by iron hammers. For some, iron lumps were inserted into their mouths. Some climbed mountains that had thickets of swords and trees that had leaves of swords, were pounded with a pestle, were ground in a mill, were melted on a copper pillar, or remained on an iron bed. Thus, he saw them experience unbearable sufferings.
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-041-002-154}}}As for some, an iron cauldron, intensely glowing in the flames of fire, came to a boil, and in the intensely hot glow, Nanda saw beings experiencing suffering by being boiled. Furthermore, he saw an empty iron cauldron boiling, intensely glowing in the flames of fire and hot, without any beings. Very frightened, he asked the hell guard, “Hey, due to what causes and conditions are beings being boiled in the other iron cauldrons while only this iron cauldron boils empty?”
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-041-002-155}}}The guard answered, “Since the Bhagavān’s younger brother, Nanda, aspiring to be born as a god, one-pointedly and properly practices pure behavior, he will be born in the world of the gods and temporarily experience pleasure, but after he dies, he will enter this iron cauldron. Therefore, we’re staying here now, having lit a fire under the iron cauldron.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-041-002-156}}}Hearing this, Nanda was very afraid. His body hair stood on end, sweat poured from his body, and he thought, “If he knows that I am Nanda, he will throw me, alive, into the cauldron.” Thinking this, he quickly fled to where the Bhagavān was.
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-041-002-157}}}The Bhagavān asked, {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-041-002-683,folio:F.210.b}}} “Did you see hell beings?”
Nanda pathetically broke into tears. Crying and in a tenuous voice, as if he were tongue-tied, he said, “I have seen them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-041-002-159}}}“What did you see?” asked the Bhagavān. Nanda told the Bhagavān in detail what he had seen.
The Bhagavān told him, “Properly practicing pure behavior because you aspire to be born as a human or strive for the world of the gods has that sort of flaw. Therefore, now, by thinking of seeking nirvāṇa, you must refrain from exerting yourself with delight in birth as a god as a result of practicing pure behavior.” When the venerable Nanda heard those words, he was speechless from shame. 
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-041-002-161}}}Then the Bhagavān, knowing what Nanda was thinking, disappeared with him from the realm of the hell beings, and, after they returned to the Jetavana, he addressed the venerable Nanda and the monks: “There are three internal stains, namely, lust, hatred, and delusion. Since they should be abandoned, you should train, exerting yourself in thoroughly abandoning them.”
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-041-002-163}}}After staying at the Jetavana for a short time, the Bhagavān went together with the assembly of monks to the city of Campa in order to tame beings according to their conditions, and he stayed on the bank of Gargā’s Pond.{{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-041-002-164}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-041-002-165}}}Later,{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-041-002-166}}} the venerable Nanda, together with five hundred monks, went to the place where the Bhagavān was. They prostrated themselves at his feet and sat to one side. Then the Bhagavān, knowing that the monks were seated to one side, said to the venerable Nanda, “I have a Dharma discourse that is virtuous at the beginning, virtuous in the middle, virtuous at the end, excellent in meaning, excellent in words, {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-041-002-684,folio:F.211.a}}} unadulterated, perfect, pure, pristine, and conducive to pure behavior, that is, the Dharma discourse entitled Entry into the Womb. Listen very well and keep it in your mind. I shall teach it to you now.” 
The venerable Nanda responded, “Yes, I wish to hear what the Bhagavān says.”
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-041-002-168}}}The Bhagavān said, “Nanda, even if there is a mother’s womb, it may be the case that one will enter into the womb, and it may also be the case that one will not enter. How will entry into a mother’s womb and then taking birth occur? If the father and the mother, both with thoughts of desire, have intercourse, if the mother’s womb is completely pure, if she is in her fertile period, and if the antarābhava{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-041-002-169}}} appears, it is to be understood that then entry into the womb will occur.
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-041-002-170}}}“In this respect, the appearance of the antarābhava can be of two types: pleasant in color and attractive, or unpleasant in color and unattractive. The color of those in the intermediate existence of hell beings is unpleasant, like, for example, a burnt tree trunk. The color of those in the intermediate existence of animals is like smoke, for example. The color of those in the intermediate existence of pretas is like water, for example. The color of those in the intermediate existence of gods and humans is like gold, for example. The color of those in the intermediate existence of the form realm is white. There is no intermediate existence for the gods of the formless realm; this is because that realm is formless. Some antarābhava beings have two arms and two legs, some have four legs or many legs, and some do not have legs. Beings will produce an antarābhava, in accordance with previous karma, whose appearance corresponds to where they will be reborn. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-041-002-685,folio:F.211.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-041-002-171}}}“Antarābhavas that will be born as gods face upward. Antarābhavas that will be born as humans, animals, or pretas proceed facing horizontally. Antarābhavas that will be born as hell beings face downward.
{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-041-002-172}}}“All antarābhavas, since they possess supernormal abilities, are able to travel through space and to see, as if with the divine eye, the place of their birth even from far away. 
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-041-002-173}}}“ ‘In her fertile period’ is when the time has come for a woman’s fertile period. Nanda, there are some women who are in their fertile period after three days, after five days, after a fortnight, or after a month has elapsed. Some, depending on conditions, will again begin a fertile period after a long time has elapsed.{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-041-002-174}}} As for women who have no physical strength, who experience much suffering, whose faces are unpleasant, and who eat and drink poor quality foods and beverages, their fertile period, when it arrives, quickly ends, just as dry earth, when it is sprinkled with water, quickly becomes dry again. As for women who have physical strength, who always experience pleasure, whose faces are pleasant, and who eat and drink good quality foods and beverages, their fertile period does not end quickly, just as moist earth, when it is sprinkled with water, does not quickly become dry again.
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-041-002-176}}}“How will entry into a mother’s womb not occur?

If the mother’s womb is clean, the antarābhava directly perceives the performance of the act of desire, there are none of the many defects mentioned earlier, and the parents and the child have the karma to encounter one another, the initial entry into the womb will occur. Furthermore, when the antarābhava enters the mother’s womb, it will have a distorted thought. If it is male, it will have desire for the mother and aversion for the father. If it is female, it will have desire for the father and aversion for the mother. Due to the force of action performed in the past, it will give rise to distorted thought due to an incorrect perception, {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-041-002-687,folio:F.212.b}}} namely, a perception of cold, or perceptions of a great wind arising, of a great rain falling, or of darkness; or it will give rise to the perception of hearing the clamorous sound of many people. Thereby, in accordance with the superior nature or inferior nature of its karma, ten incorrect perceptions{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-041-002-182}}} may arise. What are the ten? It thinks, ‘I’m now entering a house.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now climbing to the top of a multistoried building.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now entering a palace.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now ascending a throne.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now entering a grass hut.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now entering a hut of leaves.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now entering a grass thicket.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now entering a forest.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now slipping into a hole in a wall.’ Or it thinks, ‘I’m now entering the spaces in a thatched hut.’ Nanda, at that time the antarābhava, thinking in that way, enters its mother’s womb.

Just as when a worm is born in dependence upon green grass, the green grass is not the worm, and the worm does not exist separately from the green grass. However, due to the coming together of causes and conditions in dependence upon the grass, when the worm is born, the color of its body will also be green.

The presence of the water element performs the function of fluidity. The presence of the fire element performs the function of heat. The presence of the wind element performs the functions of lightness and mobility. Nanda, if the body of the kalala that depends upon the unclean emissions of the father and mother has only the earth element and lacks the water element, it will dry up and be dispersed, as when one holds dry flour or dust and so forth in one’s hand. If it has only the water element and lacks the earth element, it will leak out, as when oil or water drains away.

Nanda, if the body of the kalala has the earth and water elements but lacks the fire element, it will putrefy, as when a lump of raw meat is put in the shade in the summer. Nanda, if the body of the kalala has only the earth, water, and fire elements but lacks the wind element, it will not grow and develop. Since all these are caused by previous karma, due to their mutual causation and conditioning, when consciousness arises, the earth element acts to support the kalala, the water element causes it to cohere, the fire element causes it to mature, and the wind element causes it to expand.

If, due to moisture, the causes and conditions have come together, first the sprout, then the stalk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit, gradually appear and grow. Nanda, that seed, moreover, without the coming together of conditions, will not produce a sprout and so forth. Similarly, it should be understood that birth in the womb is not achieved through the father and mother alone, or karma alone, or another condition alone. Rather, the embryo is produced due to the coming together of the father’s sexual fluid, the mother’s blood, and causes and conditions. {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-041-002-690,folio:F.214.a}}}

These five upādāna­skandhas—rūpa, vedanā, saṃjñā, saṃskāra, and vijñāna—all have birth, persistence, growth, decline, and perishing. Birth is suffering. Persistence is illness. Growth, decline, and perishing are aging and death.

If the fetus is born as a human, {{page:{number:27,id:UT22084-041-002-699,folio:F.218.b}}} it will obtain pleasant results. If people think that tall is attractive, it will accordingly be tall. If short is attractive, it will accordingly be short. It will be thick or thin as is fitting. Its major and minor body parts will be suitable. Whether ample or slight, fat or lean, rough or not rough, it will be the same—it will be attractive and not unpleasant. Since it will have all six faculties, and its face will be pleasing, it will be superior to others. Its words will be clear, and its voice will be pleasant. It will have the characteristics of a superior person in abundance, and whoever sees it will be delighted. When it tells others about whatever it pursues through its actions of body, speech, and mind, they will believe it and remember it with respect. Why? Because that being will obtain that sort of result due to having engaged in virtuous actions in previous lives.

It is as if the fetus, bound in five places, sits impaled on the point of a sharp stick. If the mother eats too much or too little, the fetus will experience suffering. Similarly, if she eats food that is too oily, or too harsh, or too cold, or too hot or salty or tasteless, or bitter or sour or sweet and so forth, the fetus will experience suffering in all these cases.

After inserting them there, she uses the sharp knife to cut the body of the fetus into pieces and removes it from the mother’s womb.

In all instances, it will experience suffering. The newborn should also be seen as the same. Even if the newborn is bathed with appropriately warm water, it will experience great suffering. If a leper whose skin is putrid and dripping pus and blood is struck with a whip, he will experience unbearable, intense, and harsh suffering. Similarly, even when the body of the newborn is bathed with warm water, it should be seen as the same. The body of the newborn later drinks the filth of the mother’s blood and grows larger. The expression here, ‘filth of the mother’s blood,’ is taught in the noble Dharma and Vinaya as a term for milk. Therefore, Nanda, since in this way there are many types of very unbearable suffering and not even a little bit of pleasure, what wise person would conceive a desire for this sea of suffering and constantly enter the stream of saṃsāra without interruption?

Therefore, the body is tormented, completely tormented, weak and wounded, and made hungry and thirsty. Furthermore, it has various mental sufferings and is tormented, completely tormented, and extremely tormented. Many diseases also appear that skillful doctors, even when they treat them, cannot eliminate.

Being born in this way and growing large, drinking the mother’s milk mixed with blood, the person, when eating and drinking, produces, with incorrect thought, the notion of pleasant tastes. Even if, after gradually growing larger, the body is comfortable and without illness, has clothes and food and drink, and is able to last one hundred years, this very life is cut in half due to sleep. Being first a child, then a youth, until gradually becoming fully grown, the person is intensely tormented by misery, grief, and various types of illnesses. {{page:{number:35,id:UT22084-041-002-707,folio:F.222.b}}} When unable to bear the suffering of the body because indescribably, immeasurably many hundreds of thousands of feelings of suffering afflict the body, a person, not wishing to live, is happy to die. As for this body, sufferings are many, pleasures few. Although they live for a little while, in the end they will be destroyed. Therefore, Nanda, all beings will die; they lack any permanent existence whatsoever. Even if, sustained by medicine and food, they live for a long time, the Lord of Death will slay them in the end, and they will be reborn in an empty place. Therefore, since it should be understood that there is absolutely no pleasure in birth, one should pay heed to accumulating, by means of earnest effort, merit for the future, exert oneself in pure conduct and refrain from laziness, and always eagerly cultivate beneficial behavior, righteous behavior, excellent behavior, and exclusively virtuous behavior. Having always contemplated the two types of one’s own karma, virtuous and nonvirtuous, and having focused one’s mind, one will not have great regret in the future. Finally, being separated from all things to which one is attached, one will take birth in the next life according to one’s good and bad karma.

Thus, birth is suffering, {{page:{number:38,id:UT22084-041-002-710,folio:F.224.a}}} aging is suffering, illness is suffering, and death is suffering. The loss of what is pleasant is suffering, and encountering what is unpleasant is suffering. Searching for what one wants and not finding it is suffering. The five upādānaskandhas are suffering.

This body is a device made of bones, held together by ligaments, with prominent orifices and vital points—flesh and fat and bones and marrow wrapped together and covered with skin—and its faults cannot be seen. It is a burning cave, completely full of impurities. Because of regarding the various states of hair, body hair, nails, and teeth as ‘me’ and ‘mine,’ one is always powerlessly led. Spit, snot, filth, saliva, sweat, bile, and phlegm are always excreted, and fat becomes rancid. The kidneys, spleen, liver, lungs, and large and small intestines are filled with filth and are repulsive. The body is filled all over with many types of worms. Its upper and lower orifices constantly drip filth, and since the stomach and intestines are both covered with a thin skin, this body is like a toilet.

When the mother stands, or sits, or lies down, the fetus experiences exceedingly intolerable suffering, as if bound with five bonds or scorched by fire, with which nothing can be compared. Nanda, the fetus dwelling in the womb thus dwells in a bog of filth and is afflicted with many sufferings. However, due to its sharp faculties, its mind does not waver. Furthermore, some beings who have little merit lie on their side in their mother’s womb or they are upside down. Due to the power of causes and conditions of actions in former lives, or because their mother’s food is imbalanced—very cold, very hot, very sour, very sweet, or very bitter—or because she consumes more drink than she should, or has a lot of sex, or is sickly, or is burdened by many sorrows, or falls down, or is beaten, due to these conditions the mother’s body is tormented, and because it is tormented, the fetus also is tormented. Because it is tormented, it experiences many sufferings. Because it experiences many sufferings, it is agitated. Because it is agitated, the body will be incorrectly sideways and unable to emerge. Then a wise woman would smear her hand with butter or oil and insert it into the mother’s womb. Little by little, she feels the womb and establishes the fetus as it was before. When she touches it with her hand, the fetus {{page:{number:42,id:UT22084-041-002-714,folio:F.226.a}}} experiences great, unbearable sufferings.

Nanda, the fetus experiences that sort of suffering when it is in the mother’s womb. Furthermore, when it is about to be born, it likewise emerges with suffering. Due to a karmic wind, its arms will be crossed, its major and minor body parts will contract, and it will experience great, unbearable suffering. When it emerges from the mother’s womb, its limbs all turn blue. It is like a fresh boil that is unbearable to touch. Tormented by hunger and thirst, and likewise having been tormented with anxiety,{{note:{index:72,id:UT22084-041-002-306}}} and blown by the causes and conditions of a karmic wind,{{note:{index:73,id:UT22084-041-002-307}}} it emerges from the womb. And after it has emerged from the womb, when it is touched by an external wind, it is as if it were cut by a sword and smeared with ashes. When it is touched by hands or clothes, it experiences unbearable pain all over. Even though it experiences this sort of pain, because its faculties are very sharp, the fetus will have perfect mindfulness and will be unwavering.

Since they have a little wisdom, when they die they have no remorse and are stream enterers who return seven times, or as those who go from family to family, or as once-returners, or as those with only a single obstacle.

They always have desires, and their minds are completely undisciplined. Since their views and their behavior are wrong, when they die they have remorse, and because of the manifestation of their sinful, unvirtuous actions, when they die they are tormented by unbearable, intense, harsh, unpleasant suffering.

{{milestone:{label:1.190,id:UT22084-041-002-391}}}At that time, the venerable Nanda passed far beyond the wilderness of the sea of saṃsāra. Having gone to the place of ultimate bliss, nirvāṇa, and having obtained the fruit of arhatship, he was exceedingly happy and spoke in verse:{{note:{index:98,id:UT22084-041-002-392}}}

I have obtained this supreme fruit.”
{{milestone:{label:1.192,id:UT22084-041-002-395}}}Then the numerous retinues, having heard what he said, all became uncertain, and in order to eliminate their uncertainty, asked the Great Teacher, “Venerable one, what action did this venerable Nanda formerly do, as reward for which the color of his body came to resemble the color of gold, he himself was adorned with the thirty marks, and he became only four finger-widths shorter than the Bhagavān? Please tell us why the Great Teacher took pity on Nanda for his strong attachment to desirable objects and, having freed him with his power from the ocean of saṃsāra, established him with skill in means in the final nirvāṇa?”
{{milestone:{label:1.193,id:UT22084-041-002-396}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Monks, everything happened due to the maturation of the fruits produced by the monk Nanda’s past actions.” After speaking in detail, as was taught elsewhere, he spoke in verse:

{{milestone:{label:1.195,id:UT22084-041-002-399}}}“Listen, you monks! In the past, ninety-one eons previously, when beings were able to live for eighty thousand years, the tathāgata, arhat, completely and perfectly awakened one, endowed with knowledge and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassed charioteer of humans to be trained, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha and bhagavān named Vipaśyin appeared in the world. Wandering through the land together with a saṅgha of sixty-two thousand monks, he went to the vicinity of the palace of the ruler of the town Soft{{note:{index:101,id:UT22084-041-002-400}}} and stayed in Soft Grove. {{page:{number:56,id:UT22084-041-002-728,folio:F.233.a}}} At that time, the Bhagavān had a younger brother by a different mother. Due to the brother’s great attachment to sensual objects and his greed, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened Buddha Vipaśyin urged him to go forth in order to pass beyond the ocean of saṃsāra and, with skillful means, established him in the state of final nirvāṇa.
{{milestone:{label:1.196,id:UT22084-041-002-401}}}“At that time, the lord of that place, who was named Soft, governed. In this way, the king tamed the people with the Dharma. The many people flourished, and, having a good harvest, they were happy. There were no cheaters or thieves, and they were free from illness. Full of oxen, goats and sheep, rice, and sugarcane, the place flourished. The king had a younger brother by a different mother, and he, too, had great attachment to the objects of sense desires and was greedy. The king heard that the Bhagavān, together with his retinue, was staying in Soft Grove, and, together with his queens, the prince, the ministers, and a group of many people, he went to where the Bhagavān was. Having paid homage with his head at the feet of the Bhagavān, he sat to one side, and since the Bhagavān instructed the king and his retinue with a very excellent Dharma sermon and encouraged them, they acquired exalted knowledge. The king’s younger brother, being attached to sense pleasures, was not able to go forth from home,{{note:{index:102,id:UT22084-041-002-402}}} and the sons of ministers and other friends with whom he had formerly played said, ‘Hey, friend, remember—the king, the prince, the retinue of queens, the ministers, together with a multitude of people, went to where the Tathāgata Vipaśyin is and, by listening with reverence to the holy Dharma, acquired exalted knowledge. Thus, you, too, since you have now obtained a human body that is exceedingly difficult to obtain, why, being attached to sense pleasures and greedy, are you not able to even get out the door?’ Having heard this scolding, the king’s younger brother became very ashamed. Following behind them, he went with them.
{{milestone:{label:1.197,id:UT22084-041-002-403}}}“At that time, the monk who was the Bhagavān’s younger brother saw those many people {{page:{number:57,id:UT22084-041-002-729,folio:F.233.b}}} going together in a group and asked them, ‘Hey, why do you go together in a group leading this solitary man?’ They told him in detail what had happened. The monk then said, ‘I am the Bhagavān’s younger brother. Formerly, when I was a layman, because I was very attached to the objects of sense desires and greedy, the Great Teacher, thinking of me with compassion, delivered me from saṃsāra with his power and established me in final nirvāṇa. Furthermore, since there is this sort of foolish person, just like me, it is very good that, out of compassion, you have come together, leading him. Now, lead him to the place where the Bhagavān, the unsurpassed great teacher, is, and he will undoubtedly give rise to great faith.’
{{milestone:{label:1.198,id:UT22084-041-002-404}}}“After the monk said that, they went together to the place where the Bhagavān was and the Bhagavān, seeing them, correctly taught them according to their faculties and their resolve. As they listened, he gave rise to great faith. He got up from his seat, removed his robe from one shoulder, joined his hands together, and said to the Bhagavān, ‘Bhagavān, Great Teacher, will you agree to come, together with the noble saṅgha, to bathe in the bathhouse in my home tomorrow at noon?’ The Bhagavān, saying nothing, agreed to go. Knowing that he had agreed to come, the king’s younger brother paid homage at the Bhagavān’s feet and left. 
{{milestone:{label:1.199,id:UT22084-041-002-405}}}“Then he arrived at the place where the king was, and respectfully paying homage to the king, he said, ‘Great king, having gone to where the Bhagavān is, I listened to the Dharma, and, having given rise to great faith, I gave rise to a mental state of disillusionment with the objects of sense desires. Then I asked the Bhagavān to come, together with the saṅgha of śrāvakas, to bathe in the bathhouse in my home tomorrow at noon. The Great Teacher, the Tathāgata, thought of me compassionately and agreed to come. The Bhagavān is worthy of being honored by gods and humans. This being so, it is right that Your Majesty should sweep the paths and roads of the city {{page:{number:58,id:UT22084-041-002-730,folio:F.234.a}}} and sprinkle them with water and make it beautiful.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.200,id:UT22084-041-002-406}}}“The king thought, ‘If the Bhagavān comes to the city, I must make my city beautiful, but, since my younger brother is attached to sense pleasures and is difficult to reform, it would really be wonderful if the Bhagavān would now tame him.’ The king said, ‘Very good, younger brother. Go and prepare whatever articles are necessary for the bath. And I must decorate the city as much as possible.’ The king’s younger brother was overjoyed, and he paid homage to the king, got up, and left. Then the king instructed his ministers, ‘Hey, you. Now make an announcement in the city. Tell the people living in the city and those from various places that the Bhagavān will come to the city tomorrow and that they should each make the city as beautiful as possible and sweep the paths and roads, sprinkle them with water, and, taking flowers and incense and perfume, go welcome the Great Teacher.’ 
“ ‘It will be done according to Your Majesty’s command,’ said the ministers.
{{milestone:{label:1.201,id:UT22084-041-002-408}}}“Conveying the king’s orders, they commanded everyone to understand, making the announcement, and the people removed the stones, pottery shards, and clods of dirt in the city. Having sprinkled the ground all over with perfumed water, they burned excellent incense; they raised many umbrellas, victory banners, and flags;{{note:{index:103,id:UT22084-041-002-409}}} and, by strewing flowers, they made the city resemble the pleasure garden of Śakra, lord of the gods. 
{{milestone:{label:1.202,id:UT22084-041-002-410}}}“At that time, the king’s younger brother prepared fragrant water, fragrant oil, and so forth, and, having made the bathhouse beautiful, he prepared a seat and spread out a mat. The Tathāgata Vipaśyin gradually approached the city, and the king, the prince, the ministers, the queens, the queens’ attendants, and a multitude of people came out from the city. After welcoming the Tathāgata, they paid homage from a distance and attended upon him and entered the city. At that time, the king’s younger brother invited the Bhagavān to come to his bathhouse. He offered fragrant water and so forth and invited him to bathe. He saw the Bhagavān’s gold-colored body adorned with the thirty-two marks and the eighty minor marks, {{page:{number:59,id:UT22084-041-002-731,folio:F.234.b}}} and, overjoyed, he gave rise to a very pure faith. After bathing, the Bhagavān got dressed. Having paid homage with his head at the two feet of the Bhagavān, the younger brother, making an aspiration, said, ‘Now I have performed a trifling act of worship to the most excellent field of merit. Due to this root of virtue, may I obtain in the future a golden body no different from that of the Bhagavān. Just as the Bhagavān’s brother was delivered from his attachment to the objects of sense desires and his greed by the Bhagavān’s power and led to the final nirvāṇa, in the same way, in the future, may I, too, becoming the younger brother of the Tathāgata, obtain a golden body. When I am attached to the objects of sense desires and greedy, may I too be delivered by the Bhagavān’s power from the deep river of craving and established in the bliss of nirvāṇa.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.203,id:UT22084-041-002-411}}}“Monks, if you think that the one who was, at that time, the younger brother of King Soft, who was attached to sense pleasures, was someone else, do not see it that way. He was the monk Nanda himself. In the past, he invited the Tathāgata Vipaśyin to come to his bathhouse to bathe with fragrant water and so forth. With very pure faith, he made an aspiration, and due to his roots of virtue, he has now become the Tathāgata’s younger brother, and his body has become like gold in color. With my power, I have rescued him from his attachment to the objects of sense desires and his greed. He has gone forth from his home into homelessness, and he has arrived at final nirvāṇa, the state of total bliss.”
{{milestone:{label:1.204,id:UT22084-041-002-412}}}Then, the numerous retinues became uncertain and again asked the Bhagavān, “Venerable one, what did the venerable Nanda do in the past that he should obtain the thirty marks of a great man?”
The Bhagavān replied, “Monks, it is due to the karma that he produced” and so forth, in detail just as before. 
{{milestone:{label:1.205,id:UT22084-041-002-414}}}“In the past, in an outlying village, lived a rich householder with a great deal of wealth, {{page:{number:60,id:UT22084-041-002-732,folio:F.235.a}}} not lacking in necessities. He had a pleasure garden full of flowers and fruit, a fountain, a waterfall, and trees, suitable for a monk’s hermitage. At that time, there were pratyekabuddhas who, because of their compassion for beings, appeared in the world and lived in solitary places. At that time, when no buddha had arisen in the world, they were the only fields of merit.{{note:{index:104,id:UT22084-041-002-415}}} A pratyekabuddha, wandering through the country, arrived at that outlying village and looked all over. Having searched for a place to stay, he arrived at the pleasure garden. The man who guarded the pleasure garden, having seen the noble one, said, ‘Did you travel safely? Noble one, please stay here to recover from your weariness.’
{{milestone:{label:1.206,id:UT22084-041-002-416}}}“At midnight, he was absorbed in equipoise on the fire element, and the man who guarded the pleasure garden saw him and thought, ‘This great venerable one is one who has perfected this sort of outstanding practice.’ Therefore, he got up during the night and, going to the place where the householder was, said, ‘Great householder, now give rise to great joy. A noble one came to me in the pleasure garden and stayed the night. He is engaged in a sublime practice and, since he possesses great magical power, he emits a great light and it illuminates the pleasure garden.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.207,id:UT22084-041-002-417}}}“The householder heard what he said and quickly hurried to the pleasure garden. Paying homage at the pratyekabuddha’s two feet, he said, ‘Noble one, since you wish for alms and I seek merit, think compassionately of me and please stay in this pleasure garden. I will always provide you with alms.’ The pratyekabuddha, seeing that the householder was entreating him reverently, consented, and, dwelling in that pleasure garden, entered into equipoise in meditative concentration and the supreme liberation{{note:{index:105,id:UT22084-041-002-418}}} and experienced bliss.
{{milestone:{label:1.208,id:UT22084-041-002-419}}}“At another time, the pratyekabuddha thought, ‘This putrid body of mine has been cycling in saṃsāra. Since I have achieved what was to be done, it is appropriate for me to enter nirvāṇa, the state of peace, and actualize never being born again.’ Thinking this, he rose up into the sky. {{page:{number:61,id:UT22084-041-002-733,folio:F.235.b}}} He entered into equipoise on the fire element and revealed his supernormal abilities. He radiated great rays of light. Above, he displayed flame and heat, below, a flow of water, and so forth. Having abandoned this body, his consciousness was not born again, and he completely transcended suffering in the state of nirvāṇa without remainder. Then the householder took his bones{{note:{index:106,id:UT22084-041-002-420}}} and cremated them with entirely fragrant wood. He put the fire out with milk, gathered the remaining bones, put them in a new urn, and built a stūpa. He planted parasols, banners, and flags. With very pure faith, he sprinkled them with sublimely fragrant water thirty times. He made a great aspiration: ‘May I have the excellent marks.’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.209,id:UT22084-041-002-421}}}“Monks, listen carefully. If you think that the one who was, at that time, the householder was someone else, do not see it that way. He was Nanda himself. Due to the karma of making the best offerings and producing reverence and very pure faith, now he experiences the fruit of obtaining the thirty exalted, excellent marks.”
{{milestone:{label:1.210,id:UT22084-041-002-422}}}Then the numerous retinues again became uncertain and asked the Bhagavān, “Venerable one, what action did the venerable Nanda perform by doing which, if he did not go forth but remained a layman, he would doubtlessly become a powerful universal monarch?”
{{milestone:{label:1.211,id:UT22084-041-002-423}}}The Bhagavān said, “Monks, when the fruit of the karma that the venerable Nanda produced in previous lives matures, he himself will doubtlessly experience it,” and so forth. (This is again to be supplied in detail as it was given in detail above.)
{{milestone:{label:1.212,id:UT22084-041-002-424}}}“Monks, in the past, in this Good Eon, when beings could live to the age of twenty thousand years, the tathāgata, arhat, complete and perfect buddha named Kāśyapa, who possessed the thirty marks, appeared in the world. {{page:{number:62,id:UT22084-041-002-734,folio:F.236.a}}} He stayed at Ṛṣipatana Deer Park in Vārāṇasī. At that time, King Kṛkin was king in the city. Taming the people by means of the Dharma, he ruled according to the Dharma, and so forth. (The rest is to be supplied in detail as above.) The king had three sons, oldest, middle, and youngest.

He put out the fire with milk, gathered the relics, and placed them inside a jeweled urn. He made a stūpa out of four types of jewels, one yojana around and half a yojana high. When it was time to erect the wheels, the middle son of the king climbed up and erected the middle wheel.

In this lifetime, if he had not gone forth, he would in the same way have wielded power as a powerful universal monarch with great authority.”
{{milestone:{label:1.215,id:UT22084-041-002-427}}}Then the numerous retinues became uncertain and again asked the Bhagavān, “Venerable one, please explain what the venerable Nanda did in the past so that he is the best among the śrāvakas at controlling the doors of the senses.”
{{milestone:{label:1.216,id:UT22084-041-002-428}}}The Bhagavān replied, “This is through the power of a past aspiration.

As long as he lived, he practiced perfect conduct, but in that lifetime, he did not achieve any realizations, and at the time of his death, he said, ‘Under the dispensation of the Tathāgata, I practiced perfect conduct for as long as I lived, but in this lifetime, I did not have any realizations. Due to this root of virtue of practicing perfect conduct, the Bhagavān Kāśyapa prophesied that, in the future, this brahmin boy named Superior{{note:{index:107,id:UT22084-041-002-429}}} would fully awaken to complete and perfect awakening and would be named Śākyamuni, and I, in the dispensation of that bhagavān, would go forth from home into homelessness. Having abandoned the afflictions, I will obtain the fruit of arhatship. Just as my preceptor, in the dispensation of this bhagavān, was the best at controlling the doors of the senses, in the same way, let me, too, be best in the dispensation of that bhagavān at controlling the doors of the senses.’ Having made such an aspiration, by the force of that aspiration, now, here in my dispensation, he has become the best among the śrāvakas at controlling the doors of the senses.
