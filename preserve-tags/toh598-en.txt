{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-090-042-43}}}{{note:{index26,id:UT22084-090-042-44}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Sukhāvatī. The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfectly awakened Buddha Amitāyus was staying joyfully in the grove of the excellent secret palace, Dharma Proclamation.{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-090-042-45}}} He said to the bodhisattva, the great being, Noble Avalokiteśvara, “Child of noble family, there are beings who suffer, are afflicted with diseases, and have short lifespans. To help them, one should uphold this dhāraṇī called the crown victory of all tathāgatas and teach it extensively to others for the sake of long life.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-090-042-46}}}Then the bodhisattva, the great being, Avalokiteśvara arose from his seat, joined his palms, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-090-042-152,folio:F.248.b}}} and said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please teach the dhāraṇī called the crown victory of all tathāgatas.

At the center draw{{note:{index46,id:UT22084-090-042-57}}} an elaborately ornamented eight-spoked wheel with white powder. At the center of that is Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Natural Essence. Then, install these tathāgatas on each of the spokes of the wheel in order, starting in the east: Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Sky-Like Feast Gathering, Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Essence of the Earth, Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Essence of Jewels, Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from Nutritious Food, Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Boundless Essence, Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Essence of Splendor, Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Sound of a Drum, and Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from a Breeze.

{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-090-042-60}}}“Make a maṇḍala with seats for the tathāgatas and offer them whatever flowers are in season. Set up a throne in the upper half of it and place upon it a caitya of Vairocanagarbha in a water vessel. Also place there a piece of paper or a leaf with the syllables of the mantra and the practitioner’s name on it and a vase filled with water. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-090-042-61}}}“Place four vases in the four directions surrounding the lotus and decorate them with silken tassels, parasols, and pennants. To the east place the goddess Uṣṇīṣavijayā Who Conquers All Obstacles. In the south is the goddess Uṣṇīṣavijayā Who Conquers Death. In the west is the goddess Uṣṇīṣavijayā Who Conquers Afflictive Emotions. In the north is the goddess Uṣṇīṣavijayā Who Conquers Illnesses of the Aggregates. In the southeast is Life-Granting Vajra Garland. In the southwest is Mahāmāyā. In the northwest is Golden Light. In the northeast is Life-Granting Golden Garland. 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-090-042-62}}}“Fill four vessels with perfumed water, hang flower garlands on them, and place them there also. Around these draw three images with colored powder. In the first line arrange one thousand molded images made with wet clay that is free from hairs and the like. If one thousand are not possible, it is essential to set out at least one hundred. Make offerings in the four directions with utmost honor and respect. 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-090-042-63}}}“A dharmabhāṇaka who maintains a vow {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-090-042-155,folio:F.250.a}}} not to speak any other words should recite this dhāraṇī. Each time they recite the dhāraṇī, they should make offerings to the head of the caitya and consecrate it. After reciting one thousand times, they should wave their hand at the head of the central caitya and make offerings of flowers, incense, lamps, scented water, food offerings, and so forth. One thousand of each of these offerings should be arranged in lines around the caitya. Make sure that the line of lamps burns without being blown out by the wind for as long as it takes to finish the rite, and maintain equipoise and strict purity. 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-090-042-64}}}“If the rite is performed in this way, a lifespan of seven days will thereby become seven years, a lifespan of seven years will become a supremely long life, one will be free from illness and live for a hundred years, and one will never meet an untimely death. If one follows some other procedure to perform the rite, it will not work.”
