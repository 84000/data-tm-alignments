The Prophecy for Bhadra the Illusionist
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-043-002-90}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-043-002-537,folio:F.17.b}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling at Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha together with a saṅgha of 1,250 monks and five thousand renowned bodhisattva mahāsattvas—renowned for having attained the superknowledges, the retentions, the miraculous power of magical display, and acceptance that phenomena are unborn—such as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Siṃha, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Siṃhamati, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-043-002-538,folio:F.18.a}}} the bodhisattva mahāsattva Fine Sandalwood, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sārathi, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāsārathi, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prabhāśrī, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Radiant, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Endowed with Brilliant Light and Having a Melodious Voice, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prabhāvyūha, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Clear Mind, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Essence of Beings, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Disciplined Charioteer of Beings, all the bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the Fortunate Eon, such as Maitreya, and other bodhisattvas such as Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta and so forth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-002-94}}}Śakra, ruler of the gods, was also there with them. Brahmā, the lord of this world Endurance, was there, too, as were the Four Great Kings. Many gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, and mahoragas also surrounded them.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-002-95}}}While the Blessed One was residing near the great city of Rājagṛha, kings, chief ministers, brahmins, householders, and people of the villages and countryside all paid respect, venerated, served, and made offerings to him. The Blessed One received robes, food, bedding, seats, and medicines to cure the sick. Extensive verses of praise further elevated the Blessed One’s fame and reputation.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-002-96}}}Thus the tathāgata, arhat, complete and perfect Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct, the Sugata, the knower of the world, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-043-002-539,folio:F.18.b}}} the unsurpassed guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the Blessed Buddha—the all-knowing and all-seeing one—knew all and saw all and was endowed with the ten strengths of a tathāgata, the four fearlessnesses of a tathāgata, and the four correct discernments. He was endowed with the eighteen unique qualities of the buddhas, great loving-kindness, and great compassion. He was endowed with the unfailing buddha eye and the five eyes, and he had also gained miraculous powers: the miraculous power of foretelling, the miraculous power of instruction, and the miraculous power of magical display.{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-043-002-97}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-043-002-98}}}If he wished, he could suspend this trichiliocosm—including its cities, towns, lands, beings, and Mount Merus, encompassing everything up to the edges of the oceans and including the abodes of the gods, the horizons and depths, and the grasses, trees, and mountains—on the tip of a hair in space for an eon or even longer than an eon.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-043-002-99}}}At that time, an illusionist named Bhadra lived in the city of Rājagṛha. He was highly versed in the treatises and secret mantra, a master of knowledge and craft, highly accomplished, successful, and famous. He was known as the greatest of all the illusionists and disciples of illusionists in Magadha, and by dint of his fame, he enthralled, bewildered, and deceived all the throngs of people in Magadha and converted them to his spectacular ways, except for those who had seen the truth, had faith, and followed the Dharma—the lay devotees, men and women. Through his illusions, he became powerful in the craft of bewilderment and acquired tremendous profits, respect, and verses of praise. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-043-002-540,folio:F.19.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-043-002-100}}}Bhadra the illusionist heard that the fame, renown, and verses of the Blessed One were superior and that he was known as the tathāgata, arhat, complete and perfect Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct, the Sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassed guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the Blessed Buddha, the all-knowing and all-seeing one who knows all and sees all, who is endowed with the ten strengths of a tathāgata, the four fearlessnesses of a tathāgata, and the four correct discernments and who is endowed with the eighteen unique qualities of the buddhas, with great loving-kindness and great compassion, and with the unfailing buddha eye and the five eyes, and as one who has gained miraculous powers: the miraculous power of foretelling, the miraculous power of instruction, and the miraculous power of magical display. If he wished, he could suspend this trichiliocosm—including its cities, towns, lands, beings, and Mount Merus, encompassing everything up to the edges of the oceans and including the abodes of the gods, the horizons and depths, and the grasses, trees, and mountains—on the tip of a hair in space for an eon or for even longer than an eon. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-043-002-101}}}When he heard this, he thought, “I have enthralled all the people of the land of Magadha, bewildered them, deceived them, and converted them to my spectacular ways. All the brahmins and great householders delight in my name. The tathāgata, the arhat, the complete and perfect Buddha is the only one I have yet to put to the test. Since I have not yet bewildered and deceived him, I must go immediately to the tathāgata, the arhat, the complete and perfect Buddha.{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-043-002-102}}}{{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-043-002-541,folio:F.19.b}}} When I get there, I will put him to the test. If they see that I am able to bewilder and deceive him, all of Magadha will follow me alone, and I will be bolstered with even greater profits and respect.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-043-002-103}}}Then Bhadra the illusionist, impelled by his previous roots of virtue and by the power of the Buddha, left the city of Rājagṛha and went to where the Blessed One was at Vulture Peak Mountain. Upon arrival, Bhadra the illusionist saw the Tathāgata, shining with light brighter than a trillion suns, with a face more immaculate than a trillion moons, with a body well proportioned like the king of banyan trees,{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-043-002-104}}} with an ūrṇā as clearly apparent as the sparkling of a stainless jewel,{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-043-002-105}}} with lotus eyes as lustrous as a blue utpala in bloom,{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-043-002-106}}} and with an uṣṇīṣa whose top could not be seen even by Brahmā,{{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-043-002-107}}} teaching the Dharma amid his retinue in a melodious voice endowed with the sixty qualities.{{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-043-002-108}}} Seeing this, seeing such a bodily form and hearing such awakened speech, Bhadra’s mind was calmed. Nonetheless, he thought, “I must test him at once, to find out for sure whether he is all-knowing and all-seeing or not.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-043-002-109}}}Then Bhadra the illusionist, bowing to the feet of the Blessed One and thinking to test him, said, “Please come tomorrow for the midday meal.” At the same time, he was also thinking, “Does he know my intentions or not? If he does know, then he will not come. But if he does not know, he will come.”{{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-043-002-110}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-043-002-111}}}Knowing this, the Blessed One, for the sake of taming Bhadra the illusionist, and for the sake of taming the masses of the city of Rājagṛha, gave his assent to Bhadra the illusionist by remaining silent along with his saṅgha of monks. 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-043-002-112}}}Bhadra the illusionist thought, “Since my intention is to harm him {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-043-002-542,folio:F.20.a}}} and yet he has agreed, he must be neither all-knowing nor all-seeing.” Then Bhadra the illusionist bowed to the feet of the Blessed One and departed from his presence.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-043-002-113}}}Then Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana said to the Blessed One, “The illusionist Bhadra is going to harm this saṅgha of monks using his basket of illusions.” {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-043-002-114}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-043-002-115}}}The Blessed One replied, “Maudgalyāyana, do not worry! I have been engaging in correct conduct since long ago, and being a tathāgata, I know the proper time.{{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-043-002-116}}} Not even the whole world with its gods can harm a tathāgata. 
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-043-002-117}}}“Indeed, Maudgalyāyana, desire is what causes harm, anger is what causes harm, and ignorance is what causes harm. Since these, along with any latent tendencies, have been completely exhausted and forsaken by a tathāgata, who realizes that phenomena are primordially unborn,{{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-043-002-118}}} even the whole world with its gods cannot harm a tathāgata.
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-043-002-119}}}“Furthermore Maudgalyāyana, since the power of illusion of Bhadra the illusionist is limited, it is impure, while the power of illusion of a tathāgata is pure, since he is completely and manifestly awakened to all phenomena being like illusions.{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-043-002-120}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-043-002-121}}}“Maudgalyāyana, even if all those multitudes designated as belonging to the realm of beings were to possess powers of illusion like that of Bhadra the illusionist, this would not even come close to a hundredth of a tathāgata’s power of illusion; nor would it even come close to a thousandth, nor a trillionth. Nor would any such calculation, fraction, enumeration, or simile come close.
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-043-002-122}}}“Maudgalyāyana, what do you think? Is Bhadra the illusionist {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-043-002-543,folio:F.20.b}}} able to display this great trichiliocosm in its entirety, fully adorned with all its features?”
“No, he is not,” replied Maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-043-002-124}}}The Blessed One continued, “If a tathāgata so wishes, he can display all the world systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, fully adorned, on the mere tip of a hair. But even this would not show the full extent of a tathāgata’s power of illusion. Maudgalyāyana, in the ten directions there are the following maṇḍalas of wind:{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-043-002-125}}} the wind called scattering;{{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-043-002-126}}} the wind called cutting asunder, which cuts the trichiliocosm asunder and, having cut it asunder, destroys it; the wind called dispersing and scattering, which moves about in the middle of the world; the wind called all-settling, which moves about at the summit of existence; the wind called destroying, which utterly destroys even Mount Meru, the king of mountains, let alone ordinary mountains; the wind called blazing, which arises during the conflagration of an eon and whose flames blaze all the way up to the Brahmā realms; the wind called consummating, which pacifies the fire at the eon’s conflagration; the wind called delighting, which completely covers the trichiliocosm with a lattice of clouds; the wind called sprinkling with water, which causes rain to descend during the conflagration of an eon; and the wind called completely drying, which completely dries that which has been destroyed by water. 
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-043-002-127}}}“Maudgalyāyana, beginning with these maṇḍalas of wind, I could teach the Dharma for an eon or even longer than an eon, for there is no end to the Dharma taught by a tathāgata, beginning from the explanation of these maṇḍalas of wind.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-043-002-128}}}“Maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-043-002-544,folio:F.21.a}}} what do you think? Would the illusionist Bhadra be able to remain in those maṇḍalas of wind?”
“No, he would not,” replied Maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-043-002-130}}}The Blessed One continued, “Maudgalyāyana, I would be able to abide inside all those maṇḍalas of wind, all the while performing the four normal activities. If the Tathāgata so wishes, he could make all those winds enter a single mustard seed, and still the mustard seed would not be destroyed. Indeed, he could let all the activities of all those winds be displayed inside the mustard seed, and yet they would neither collide with one another nor decrease.
“Maudgalyāyana, there is nothing like the nature of my power of illusion. Indeed, it is limitless.”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-043-002-132}}}Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and the entire assembly were amazed. They bowed their heads to the feet of the Blessed One and said together with one voice, “Blessed One, we are indeed fortunate! As the teacher possesses such superior magical power, such renown for being superior in might, and such superior power, we are indeed fortunate! Blessed One, those who hear of this miraculous display of the Tathāgata will be inspired. And being inspired, they will develop the mind intent on complete and perfect awakening, so they, too, will obtain excellent fortune!”
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-043-002-134}}}Then Bhadra the illusionist went to the great city of Rājagṛha, and that very night, in the sector of the great city of Rājagṛha where all the city’s refuse and unclean things were discarded, he conjured up a great reception courtyard adorned with silken streamers, parasols, victory banners, and raised silk flags. He conjured the ground so that it was as even as the palm of a hand, strewn with flowers, fragrant with excellent incense, and adorned with a canopy above. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-043-002-545,folio:F.21.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-043-002-135}}}Within that courtyard, he also conjured eight thousand{{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-043-002-136}}} exquisite trees replete with flowers and fruits. In front of all the exquisite trees he conjured lion thrones covered with many kinds of cotton cloth and adorned with all kinds of precious silk flags. He conjured four exquisite trees replete with flowers and fruits to both the left and right of each lion throne. He conjured fine dishes endowed with a hundred flavors for the Blessed One and the saṅgha of monks to enjoy. He also conjured five hundred attendants, all dressed in white and bedecked with all kinds of accoutrements.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-043-002-137}}}As soon as Bhadra the illusionist had conjured up this banquet, the Four Great Kings, emanating as large bodies, came instantaneously to the illusionist Bhadra’s courtyard array and said to him, “Bhadra, you have invited the Tathāgata for tomorrow’s midday meal, and you have conjured such a courtyard for the Tathāgata to enjoy. You have done very well!
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-043-002-138}}}“Bhadra, please grant us permission to also make offerings to the Tathāgata, by displaying a second modest courtyard like this for the Blessed One to enjoy, to accompany yours!”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-043-002-139}}}Bhadra the illusionist was utterly amazed and granted permission to the Four Great Kings, who then conjured a similar courtyard array for the Blessed One to enjoy. 
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-043-002-140}}}Then Śakra, ruler of the gods, arrived together with thirty thousand gods at Bhadra’s courtyard array and said to him, “Bhadra, you have invited the Tathāgata for tomorrow’s midday meal, and {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-043-002-546,folio:F.22.a}}} you have conjured such a courtyard array for the Tathāgata to enjoy. You have done well! Bhadra, please grant us permission to also make offerings to the Tathāgata, by displaying a second modest courtyard like this for the Blessed One to enjoy, to accompany yours!”
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-043-002-141}}}Bhadra the illusionist, utterly amazed, granted permission to Śakra, ruler of the gods, whereupon Śakra, ruler of the gods, conjured an especially magnificent courtyard for the Blessed One to enjoy—larger even than the Vaijayanta Palace, the residence of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three with the Pārijāta tree of paradise—a courtyard that eclipsed those of Bhadra the illusionist and the Four Great Kings.
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-043-002-142}}}Then Bhadra the illusionist thought, “If even gods such as these gather with such enthusiasm to make offerings and serve the Blessed One, he must be no ordinary being. It would not be appropriate to harm such an exalted being! Without a doubt, I must dispel my creation!”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-043-002-143}}}Then Bhadra the illusionist attempted to dispel his conjurations and make them disappear. Invoking the power of all his secret mantras and vidyā mantras, he tried{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-043-002-144}}} to get rid of them and make them disappear, but the fine dishes, the attendants, the courtyard, and the lion thrones all remained, appearing just as they had before. He was not able to dispel them, even with all his secret mantras and vidyā mantras. Completely amazed, he thought, “Up until now I could create illusions at will and make them vanish at will, but now I am unable to dispel this array made for the Tathāgata.” {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-043-002-547,folio:F.22.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-043-002-145}}}Then Śakra, ruler of the gods, knowing fully what Bhadra the illusionist was thinking, said to him, “Bhadra, just as you are unable to dispel what you have created for the Tathāgata, so it is, Bhadra, for those who are able to generate even a few thoughts of the Tathāgata—their thoughts do not go away but remain a causal factor right up until their final nirvāṇa.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-043-002-146}}}Bhadra the illusionist was utterly delighted, and rejoicing, he became thoroughly overjoyed and blissful. So, that night passed with him urging the Blessed One to come for the midday meal, beseeching him, “Blessed One, when the midday meal in the middle of the day has arrived, please do kindly come for the midday meal!”{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-043-002-147}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-043-002-149}}}Early the next morning, the Blessed One donned his lower and upper robes, took up his offering bowl, gathered the saṅgha of monks, and, leading the saṅgha of monks, went to the great city of Rājagṛha, to the site of Bhadra the illusionist’s great courtyard. He then manifested a magical display such that Bhadra the illusionist was convinced that “the Tathāgata is seated at the array I have conjured,” the Four Great Kings were convinced that “the Tathāgata is seated at the array we have conjured,” and Śakra, ruler of the gods, was convinced that “the Tathāgata is seated at the array I have conjured.”
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-043-002-150}}}In the great city of Rājagṛha, word spread to others—non-Buddhists, carakas, parivrājakas, brahmins, and householders. Amazed, they rushed to the courtyard thinking, “Today the renunciant Gautama will be put to the test!” {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-043-002-548,folio:F.23.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-043-002-151}}}The faithful living in the great city of Rājagṛha—monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—likewise rushed to the gathered assembly thinking, “Today we will listen to the Tathāgata’s words,{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-043-002-152}}} and we will also see a great miraculous display.”
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-043-002-153}}}Then Bhadra the illusionist, truly overcoming his pride, haughtiness, and arrogance, bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, I confess my wrongdoing—I invited the Tathāgata to come here with severely harmful intent. But then, Blessed One, I thought that it would be wrong to deceive such an exalted being by conjuring fine dishes, servants, lion thrones, and this courtyard. Realizing that this should not be done, I tried to dispel them but was unable to do so. Even by invoking the full force of all my secret mantras and vidyā mantras, I could not make them go away. It was no use, and all these fine dishes, servants, lion thrones, and courtyard arrangements remained just as they were.”
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-043-002-154}}}The Blessed One then said to Bhadra the illusionist, “Bhadra, the amenities and enjoyments of all beings are also like this, illusory conjurations of karma.{{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-043-002-155}}} Bhadra, this saṅgha of monks is also like this, an illusory conjuration of the Dharma. Bhadra, I, too, am also like this, an illusory conjuration of wisdom. Bhadra, this entire trichiliocosm is also like this, the illusory conjuration of various manifest formations. Indeed Bhadra, all phenomena are like this, the illusory conjurations of masses of conditions.
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-043-002-156}}}“Nevertheless, Bhadra, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-043-002-549,folio:F.23.b}}} when you know the time is right, you may offer these dishes and drinks, delectables and nectars,{{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-043-002-157}}} however they have been conjured.”
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-043-002-158}}}Then the servants conjured by Bhadra and the Four Great Kings and Śakra, ruler of the gods, along with his retinue, satisfied the Blessed One and the saṅgha of monks with the conjured dishes and drinks, delectables, and nectars.
Then the elder Mahākāśyapa spoke the following verse:
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-043-002-160}}}“As is the gift,
So is the recipient.
Arriving at the true nature of both as just so, 
May the offering be perfectly purified.”{{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-043-002-161}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-043-002-160}}}Mahāmaudgalyāyana said:
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-043-002-163}}}“As for the seating arrangements
And those who are seated,{{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-043-002-164}}}
There is no distinction to be found; they are the same.
Thus the virtue of this offering is unsurpassed.”
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-043-002-163}}}Śāriputra said:
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-043-002-166}}}“As the mind of the one who serves,
So is the mind of the one who receives.
With this way of giving,
May the offering be swiftly purified!”
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-043-002-166}}}Subhūti said:
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-043-002-168}}}“The gift was given without a giver
And received without a receiver.
Thus, whosoever has come here
Purifies the offering.”

{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-043-002-170}}}“These gifts, as endless as the sky,
Are enjoyed by inconceivably numerous beings.
But it is their liberation of mind and body
That is the greatest pure offering in all the worlds.”
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-043-002-170}}}The bodhisattva Pinnacle of Light said:
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-043-002-172}}}“Like the array conjured up
By Bhadra the illusionist,
So are all material things,
But the foolish do not realize this.”
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-043-002-172}}}The bodhisattva Prabhāvyūha said: 
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-043-002-174}}}“Like these seats and trees,
So are all manifold phenomena conjured,
Like mind’s illusion—empty.
There is not the slightest difference.”
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-043-002-174}}}The bodhisattva Siṃha said: 
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-043-002-176}}}“So long as the lion’s roar is not heard,
The jackals howl in the forest.
But hearing the lion’s roar,
They flee in the ten directions.
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-043-002-177}}}“Similarly, so long as Bhadra the illusionist {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-043-002-550,folio:F.24.a}}}
Did not see the Tathāgata,
He proclaimed among the non-Buddhists,
‘I am superior to the Victorious One!’
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-043-002-178}}}“Bhadra, the Tathāgata’s illusion

{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-043-002-178}}}The bodhisattva Siṃhamati said:
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-043-002-181}}}“These fine dishes are conjurations,
As are these attendants offering service;
Even the ones enjoying it are conjurations.
Thus the virtue of this gift is unsurpassed.”
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-043-002-181}}}The bodhisattva Maitreya said:

Flares and swells ever more fiercely.
