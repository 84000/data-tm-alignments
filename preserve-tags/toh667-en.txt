At the time,{{note:{index:3,id:UT22084-091-064-272}}} in the midst of a retinue of cruel beings, he was known as “Mahākāla Who Controls the Life Breath of Living Beings.” {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-091-064-247,folio:F.199.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-091-064-71}}}At the same time, in the western world system, the King of Horses, Bringer of Death, was surrounded by an assembly of the Four Great Kings and the rest. He entered the absorption that tames arrogant beings while using the hook mudrā and reciting the mantra oṃ vajrakrodha hayagrīva hūṁ hulu hulu hūṁ vaṃ. Powerless to do otherwise, Mahākāla appeared before the King of Horses, Bringer of Death, from his abode in the Aṭṭahāsa charnel ground.{{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-091-064-72}}}
