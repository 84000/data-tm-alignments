The Great Lion’s Roar of Maitreya
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-043-004-31}}}{{F.68.a}} Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-004-33}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Śrāvastī in the park of Anāthapiṇḍada, in the Jeta Grove, together with a great saṅgha of about five thousand monks and eight thousand bodhisattva great beings, including Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, Avalokiteśvara, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Śrīgarbha, and Maitreya.
Then the Blessed One, surrounded and revered by a retinue of many hundreds of thousands, taught the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-004-35}}}At that time, Venerable Mahākāśyapa was seated among the retinue. Venerable Mahākāśyapa rose from his seat, draped his upper shawl over one shoulder, set his right knee on the ground, and with palms joined paid homage to the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-004-36}}}Then he asked the Blessed One, “If the Blessed One will allow me the opportunity, may I ask the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, to answer certain questions that I would like to pose?”
The Blessed One replied to Venerable Mahākāśyapa, “Kāśyapa, ask the Blessed One whatever you wish, and my answers to your questions will delight you.”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-043-004-38}}}Venerable Mahākāśyapa {{F.68.b}} asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how does a son or daughter of noble family who wishes for parinirvāṇa train once they have gone forth in the well-spoken Dharma and Vinaya? How do they act? How do they engage in spiritual practice?”{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-043-004-39}}}
The Blessed One replied to Venerable Mahākāśyapa, “Excellent, Kāśyapa! You have asked such a question for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, out of love for the world, and for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of the great mass of beings, gods and humans. Your intention to ask the Tathāgata a question on such a subject is excellent. So, Kāśyapa, listen well and remember what I shall explain to you.”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-043-004-41}}}Venerable Mahākāśyapa gave his assent to the Blessed One and listened attentively to the Blessed One as he said, “Kāśyapa, a son or daughter of noble family who wishes for parinirvāṇa, once they have gone forth in the well-spoken Dharma and Vinaya, should train themselves in moral discipline, in restraint by the prātimokṣa vows, and in excellence in their conduct and associations. They should see danger in even the slightest misdeed and properly keep the fundamental precepts. They should be without craving and free from hypocrisy, flattery, solicitation, extortion, and greed for profit. They should be conscientious, modest, and restrained. They should be fearful of saṃsāra and adept and assiduous in its renunciation. {{F.69.a}} They should always be sorrowful about saṃsāra and see the advantages of nirvāṇa. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-043-004-42}}}“Whether they live under trees, on a mountain, in a hut, or in a cave, they should reflect on the features of the Tathāgata: ‘Thus, the Blessed One is a tathāgata, an arhat, a fully awakened buddha, endowed with perfect knowledge and conduct, a sugata, a knower of the world, a guide of beings to be tamed, unsurpassable, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. His lineage is excellent, his family is excellent, and his virtuous roots are excellent. He is immeasurable by virtue of his moral discipline and immeasurable by virtue of his samādhi, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation. He is immeasurable by virtue of all his buddha qualities. He is endowed with unimaginable, immeasurable, and boundless positive attributes. His speech is truthful and accurate, and he acts in accordance with his words. His actions are unfailing. He is sublime, the great healer who removes the arrows of suffering, acting as a spiritual friend without even being asked. He is compassionate, the great guide. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-043-004-43}}}“ ‘He perfectly teaches the Dharma that is nirvāṇa, which profoundly manifests its profundity and peacefully shows its peace; which is empty, without living beings, without confusion, and without characteristics; and which is the eradication of characteristics. It is wishless and free of wishes. It is without complexity and free from complexity. It is difficult to see and difficult to realize. It leads onward to the goal. It is free of substantiality. It is isolated and free from isolation. It is without substantiality and unsullied by substantiality. It is motionless and the eradication of motion. It is free of movement. It is inexpressible and free of expression. It is without arrogance. It reveals itself.{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-043-004-44}}} It is unsullied and free from being sullied. {{F.69.b}} It is without acceptance or rejection. It is the pacification of suffering and the eradication of craving.’ These are the features on which they should reflect. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-043-004-45}}}“In this regard, Kāśyapa, a monk should go alone to a solitary place, and then, settling inward, he should reflect on the features of the Tathāgata in this way. He should think, ‘I have obtained a human birth, and I have gone forth, obtaining ordination into monkhood. Although I have pleased the Tathāgata, I am lazy and spoiled by the distractions of various kinds of activity, such that I do not know stability. Why is that? It is because I remain in a state in which I will die without ever attaining fruition,{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-043-004-46}}} and although the blessed buddhas appear in the world as rarely as an udumbara flower, I will not have pleased the blessed buddhas of the present and future.’ That is how a monk should reflect on the features of the Tathāgata.
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-043-004-47}}}“In this regard, Kāśyapa, monks should emulate you and the elder Subhūti. That is because of the way that, without seeing or hearing of me, you went forth in emulation of the arhats, the perfectly awakened buddhas, who dwell in this world, Kāśyapa, and became an adornment to this Dharma and Vinaya. The going forth of those who actually see the Tathāgata and, having seen him, approach him to request the going forth and ordination into monkhood is, subsequently, authorized by the Tathāgata.{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-043-004-48}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-043-004-49}}}“A son or daughter of noble family should commit to go forth in this well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya by seeing its two objectives. What are the two? They are to attain fruition in this very life {{F.70.a}} and to become in future lives the cause of others seeing the Buddhadharma.{{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-043-004-50}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-043-004-51}}}“In this regard, Kāśyapa, some foolish individuals put on saffron robes in the presence of the Tathāgata and commit to go forth and be ordained into monkhood. Undertaking the trainings, they enter a hut or a cave, close the door, and then engage in thoughts of desire, thoughts of malice or harm, thoughts of their begging bowl and their monastic robes, and thoughts of the households of friends and of alms-giving households. They think to themselves, ‘The Tathāgata does not know us. He is not aware of us and does not think of us.’
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-043-004-52}}}“Kāśyapa, whether a monk is in a hut, in a cave, or on a walking path, whenever he engages in thoughts of desire, thoughts of malice, thoughts of harm, or different kinds of nonvirtuous thoughts, the deities who dwell in that hut, in that cave, or on that walking path know the monk’s mind, and they think, ‘Why is this monk, who has gone forth in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya, engaging in thoughts of nonvirtuous and sinful actions? It is inappropriate.’ They will then be displeased, anguished, and unhappy.
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-043-004-53}}}“Kāśyapa, some of those deities will encourage him, but others, aware that the monk is not worth teaching, will settle into an attitude of contempt. Look, Kāśyapa, if those deities who possess just a modicum of virtuous roots and knowledge know the minds of others, {{F.70.b}} I need hardly mention that the Tathāgata, who has engaged in good actions for countless quintillion eons, also does so! Kāśyapa, there is nothing whatsoever that is not known, seen, comprehended, or realized by the Tathāgata. Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata possesses unobstructed wisdom with regard to the five types of objects of knowledge—those that are past, present, future, freed from time, and inexpressible. He is free of uncertainty.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-043-004-54}}}“Therefore, Kāśyapa, a son or daughter of noble family, knowing that because they have gone forth in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya they are self-reliant, should train with the thought, ‘The Tathāgata knows my mind, and because all the blessed buddhas who dwell and flourish in the limitless, infinite worlds in the ten directions also know my mind, I should not, after I have gone forth in the teaching of the Tathāgata, be a swindler-ascetic.’
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-043-004-55}}}“Now, Kāśyapa, what is a swindler-ascetic? There are four types of swindler-ascetics. What are the four? Kāśyapa, a monk who has the appearance, distinguishing marks, and figure of an ascetic but whose moral discipline is deficient and who is an evildoer is the first type of swindler-ascetic. One who goes to a secluded spot and engages in nonvirtuous thoughts while dwelling there is the second type of swindler-ascetic. One who knows himself to be an ordinary person who has not attained fruition but, overcome by desire for gain, reverence, and praise, falsely claims in the presence of others to be an arhat is the third type of swindler-ascetic. One who praises himself and denigrates others is the fourth type of swindler-ascetic. {{F.71.a}} Those, Kāśyapa, are the four types of swindler-ascetics.
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-043-004-56}}}“Kāśyapa, imagine there came along a fierce, coarse, ferocious man who was physically powerful and endowed with great strength. That man bludgeoned every person in Jambudvīpa, or stabbed them or punched them, and after subduing them robbed them and made off with all their useful goods: cowry shells, gold, precious stones, pearls, beryl, conches, crystals, coral, gold dust, silver, and different kinds of jewels, as well as their house, vehicle, clothes, food, drink, bedding, and furniture to be used or enjoyed, and every possession that could provide pleasure or leisure. What do you think, Kāśyapa? Would that man create a great deal of nonmerit on that basis?”
Kāśyapa replied, “Yes, Blessed One, he would create a great deal. Sugata, he would create a great deal.”
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-043-004-58}}}The Blessed One said, “Kāśyapa, believe this and take it to heart: when someone who knows themselves to be an ordinary person who has not attained fruition, overcome by desire for gain, reverence, and praise, falsely claims in the presence of others to be a stream enterer and then enjoys so much as a single meal of alms food, that creates an even greater amount of nonmerit. That creates an inexhaustibly greater amount of nonmerit.”
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-043-004-59}}}Then the elder Mahākāśyapa said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how wonderful is the response of the Tathāgata, the precepts{{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-043-004-60}}} taught through analogies. {{F.71.b}} Hearing such a precious analogy taught by the Tathāgata, what person who has not attained fruition would accept so much as a drink of water given by the faithful?”
The Blessed One replied, “That is right, Kāśyapa. What you say is right. One should live as if one’s head and clothes were ablaze, and until one has attained fruition, one should not accept so much as a drink of water given by the faithful.
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-043-004-62}}}“Kāśyapa, imagine there came along a second man, fiercer, coarser, and more ferocious, who was physically more powerful and endowed with greater strength.

What do you think, Kāśyapa? Would that man create a great deal of nonmerit on that basis?”
Kāśyapa replied, “Yes, Blessed One, he would create a great deal. Sugata, he would create a great deal.”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-043-004-64}}}The Blessed One said, “Kāśyapa, believe this and take it to heart: when someone who knows themselves to be an ordinary person who has not attained fruition, overcome by desire for gain, reverence, and praise, falsely claims in the presence of others to be a once-returner {{F.72.a}} and then enjoys so much as a single meal of alms food, that creates an even greater amount of nonmerit. That creates an inexhaustibly greater amount of nonmerit. 
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-043-004-65}}}“But, Kāśyapa, never mind the useful goods of all the people in a four-continent universe. Imagine there came along a third man, much fiercer, much coarser, and even more ferocious, who was physically much more powerful and endowed with much greater strength, and that man bludgeoned every person born in a small thousandfold universe, or stabbed them or punched them, and after subduing them robbed them and made off with all of their useful goods: cowry shells, gold, precious stones, pearls, beryl, conches, crystals, coral, gold dust, silver, and different kinds of jewels, as well as their house, vehicle, clothes, food, drink, bedding, and furniture to be used or enjoyed, and every possession that could provide pleasure or leisure.

Therefore, Kāśyapa, you should speak words of encouragement to them so that, on hearing them, those yogis who engage in spiritual practice{{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-043-004-79}}} will be pleased and happy.

In comparison, when someone who has practiced properly, whose moral discipline is pure, and whose livelihood is pure accepts so much as a drink of water given in faith by a donor, that will create for them an enormous amount of merit.

They are to be envious of another’s gain, to commit offenses against moral discipline after studying the sūtras connected with the precepts, to violate the Tathagata’s teachings or the training and then arrogantly conceal it while neither discerning nor confessing it, and to then knowingly enjoy gifts from the faithful.

The Blessed One replied to Venerable Mahākāśyapa, “Kāśyapa, what is the point of you asking the Tathāgata for an account of this? Let it go, Kāśyapa, because if the Tathāgata actually described and explained all the faults of those foolish peoples’ sinful desires, false conceptions, deceits, frauds, errors, malign flaws, and malign forces, after you heard of the sinful behavior of those unholy individuals, even though it is incorrect, it would not appear so to you.”

Afflicted with an illness, the man takes to his bed to lie down after experiencing chest pain. At that point, a certain confused man who is rich, with ample wealth and possessions, arrives and says to the bed-ridden man, ‘Fellow, I entrust you with this treasure of mine, but when I return in ten or twenty years’ time from another region, return this treasure to me.’ He hands over the treasure, and after entrusting it in this way, he goes off to another region.

The Blessed One replied, “Yes, indeed, Kāśyapa. I, too, am aware of this. However, I knowingly asked this of you because if they hear your eloquent analogy, those unholy individuals will develop remorse.”
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-043-004-101}}}Then the elder Mahākāśyapa said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I venture to draw a second analogy here. I would compare it, Blessed One, to this: there is a certain person whose constitution is healthy and free of illness, who will live for many hundreds of thousands of years, and who is youthful, a young man. He has plenty of attendants and plenty of resources, an excellent lineage and family, and a virtuous disposition. He is loving and greatly compassionate, cheerful, and equanimous towards the faults of beings and the faults of the defilements. He acts for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, out of love for the world, and for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of the great mass of beings, gods and humans. He is steadfast in his endeavors. A certain man comes into the presence of that holy individual and says, ‘Fellow, I entrust you with this treasure of mine, so hide and protect it well. When I return in ten- or twenty-years’ time from another region, return this treasure to me.’ When he hands the treasure over, the man accepts it and hides and protects it well, and when the other man returns, he gives it back to him.

He thinks to himself, ‘After I have received this royal anointment, I shall act as king.’ He is encouraged by this thought and so becomes deeply involved in all royal activities. In the same way, when the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, passes away, this bodhisattva great being {{F.77.a}} Maitreya will be bestowed with the great sovereignty of the kingdom of the authentic Dharma; therefore I beg him to deeply involve himself in protecting the authentic Dharma.”

This is so that once I have learned of those causes in this way, Blessed One, I will understand them and so will abandon them all the faster and protect myself from those flaws. In addition, it is so that some of those unholy individuals will say, ‘The Tathāgata knows me, and the Tathāgata understands me; he understands me perfectly,’ and will develop faith in the Tathāgata.”
The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “Listen well and remember, then, Maitreya, and I shall teach you just a little about the flaws of those unholy individuals.

If one monastic sees another monastic coming toward a house that they have visited before, they will think ‘This is my house!’ They will then give the other angry looks and become hostile, fighting, quarreling, arguing, and contending over it.

When, on his arrival there, he taught the Dharma, the kings, important ministers, and most of the rest of the population would honor him, make offerings to him, pay homage to him, and show him reverence.

It was other houses that he went to—those of misers, people without faith, and those with wrong views—and when he arrived there, they gave him no welcome. Not only did they not speak pleasantly to him, they got angry and abused him. But he, by donning the armor of patience and remaining greatly compassionate, was not distressed on going to those houses, and he felt no unhappiness.

After that he did not enter them a second time. He aroused faith in the houses of misers, people without faith, and those with wrong views, and even when they got angry and abused him, he was not distressed and felt no unhappiness.

The bodhisattva great being Maitreya replied to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, resolved to free their only son, they would think, ‘I shall quickly free my only son from this prison!’ They would enter the prison focused solely on their only son.

You should consider the king’s prison to be just like the prison of saṃsāra. By analogy, Maitreya, you should consider the merchant or householder to be just like a bodhisattva.

Maitreya, a monk who wishes to go to houses should go with no present apart from the Dharma, not bringing any other present; he should be learned, versed in the scriptures, fearless, free from craving, free from hypocrisy, not a flatterer, and not possessive. He should go to houses out of love for the Dharma. Having arrived at the house, he should utter praise of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and he should utter praise of generosity, moral discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and wisdom.

At that time, a certain monk drew a well-drawn, refined image of the Tathāgata on silk. He then took it to the palace of the king, the father of the bodhisattva Great Diligence.
{{milestone:{label:1.278,id:UT22084-043-004-408}}}“Kāśyapa, when the bodhisattva Great Diligence saw {{F.109.b}} the image of the Tathāgata, he thought, ‘If even an image of the Tathāgata is as dear to behold as this, what need is there to mention a tathāgata, arhat, completely awakened buddha himself? How I wish I possessed a body such as this!’ With that thought, he became joyful, overjoyed, and full of faith. At that time, he lost all joy in his household, thinking that by staying at home he would be unable to accomplish such a body. So he decided to renounce his home.

“His parents replied, ‘Boy, do not say that—we two have no dear, beloved, and handsome only-son but you! If we do not see you, it will be the death of us.’
“The boy replied, ‘While I will certainly not harm the two of you, I will still renounce my home.’
“His parents answered, ‘How will you do that, boy?’
“The boy replied, ‘Starting from today, for as long as I do not renounce home, I will not ask for food, go to bed, rub myself with butter or oil, or ask for a drink. Nor will I utter a single word, whether virtuous or nonvirtuous.’

Then his parents put to one side all the cowry shells, gold, precious stones, pearls, beryl, conches, crystals, gold dust, silver, and, furthermore, jewels, clothing, and various ornaments that could be found in the king’s palace. They summoned eighty-four thousand young women who were like goddesses, adorned them with all the ornaments, and stood them to one side.

They pleaded with him all day and night, saying, ‘Young man, get up and eat some food! Give alms and perform acts of merit while staying here at home.

Even though they touched his feet in supplication, he never even looked at them.
“Then, Kāśyapa, a deity who happened to live in the king’s palace appeared, by a great miracle, in midair and spoke these verses to the crowds of people:

Then, while the eighty-four thousand women, his parents, and the assembled relatives wept with tearful faces, he carried the image of the Tathāgata out of his own city and went into an unpopulated wilderness, a forest where wild animals lived.

Then, in front of that cotton canvas, he sat down cross-legged on a mat of grass and in an upright posture and analyzed that image of the Tathāgata. As he analyzed it, he thought, ‘Because even this image of the Tathāgata is so beautiful, it is needless to say that the Blessed One himself is too. And because such a beautiful blessed buddha is a marvel, whoever sees the Tathāgata is fortunate.’ And he reflected on how one should visualize the Tathāgata.

The body of the Tathāgata is also characterized in that way. Just as this image of the Tathāgata amounts to nothing more than a label, so too all phenomena amount to nothing more than labels, which are empty in essence and unmoving by nature. The body of the Tathāgata is also characterized in that way. Just as this image of the Tathāgata is without attainment, without realization, without knowledge, without actualization, without fruition, without realization of fruition, without a ground, without a basis, without going, without coming, without arising, without ceasing, without pollution, without purification, without sound, without what is proper, without what is improper, without the extinguishing of desire, without the extinguishing of anger, without the extinguishing of ignorance, without aggregates, without elements, without sense fields, without what is prior, without what is later, and without what is in between, so too are all phenomena. The body of the Tathāgata {{F.112.b}} is also characterized in that way. Just as this image of the Tathāgata is unmoving and inactive, so are all phenomena. The body of the Tathāgata is characterized in exactly the same way. Just as this image of the Tathāgata does not look, does not listen, does not smell, does not taste, does not touch, does not think, does not lie down, does not get up, does not exhale, does not inhale, and is not conscious, so too all phenomena. Just like all phenomena, the body of the Tathāgata is also characterized in that way. Just as this image of the Tathāgata is not included in the desire realm, is not included in the form realm, and is not included in the formless realm, so too all phenomena.

He also accomplished the all-illuminating samādhi, after which luminosity arose. Because of that luminosity, with the pure divine eye that transcends human sight he saw the incalculable, countless blessed buddhas of the ten directions. With his unimpeded divine ear he also heard all the Dharma taught by those blessed buddhas.

“Kāśyapa, a bodhisattva should honor the body of the Tathāgata just as the bodhisattva great being Great Diligence honored the body of the Tathāgata. When he honored it in that way, analyzing it as it really is, he also developed the trait of great wisdom. By means of the trait of wisdom, {{F.113.b}} he saw the immeasurable, countless, incalculable blessed buddhas of the ten directions and heard their teaching of the Dharma.

They will be overcome with craving and desire. Thinking to attain accomplishments and magic powers, they will worship images of the Tathāgata drawn on cotton robes or on walls, or other images. They will become conceited, thinking, ‘We worship the Tathāgata, but {{F.114.a}} others do not worship him.’ They will praise themselves for that slight act of virtue and disparage others, while thinking to make their living on that basis.

At that time, householders and those who have gone forth will become knowledgeable and expert in making offerings and paying homage.
