Thus did I hear at one time. In the vast Pāruṣyaka grove on the summit of Mount Sumeru, the blessed and glorious great fierce one Vajrapāṇi—whose body blazes like the fire that consumes the world at the end of an eon, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-091-068-331,folio:F.203.a}}} who is victorious over the threefold world, and who burns with the fire of a thousand suns—sat surrounded by a retinue including Śakra and a horde of piśācas, rākṣasas, and mātṛkās numbering in the billions. Seated on a lotus, glorious Vajrapāṇi proclaimed, “Eight classes of divine and demonic beings in my retinue, listen to me! There is a great regent in this desire realm known as the mother of the demon{{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-091-068-74}}} and Yama’s sister.
