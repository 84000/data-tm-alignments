{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-091-069-67}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-091-069-385,folio:F.209.b}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak Mountain, where he was delivering a teaching on correct names to all causal and resultant bodhisattvas. At that time, Śrīdevī Mahākālī approached the Blessed One, circled him three times, and sat to one side in the presence of the Blessed One. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-091-069-388,folio:F.210.a}}} The bodhisattva Virility of a Lion asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what are the different names of this bodhisattva who acts for the benefit of the world while adorned as a rākṣasī?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-091-069-70}}}The Blessed One considered the bodhisattva Virility of a Lion, looked at Śrīdevī Kālī, and said: 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-091-069-279}}}“You are identified as the cause, effect, and conditions 
That are paramount for listening, contemplating, and meditating. 
Supreme among the wise, you benefit beings. 
You are the exalted Śrīdevī Kālī.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-091-069-280}}}“You are a bodhisattva emanation, 
A foundation as stable as the earth,

And cause awakening to ripen, like fire. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-091-069-281}}}“You gather virtue like the blowing wind 
And your insight is pure, like space.

And travel the path of insight and compassion. 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-091-069-283}}}“You are like a beautiful vessel
With water like a wish-fulfilling jewel.

And have a radiance like the sun.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-091-069-284}}}“Your mind shines like the moon, 
Your name is like the horns of a rabbit,

And you are rare like an udumbara flower.
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-091-069-285}}}“You completely satisfy like amṛta,
Are the ruler of all beings,
Teach that there is no inherent nature, 
And are like a storm of water and sky. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-091-069-286}}}“You use any means to tame disciples in the three existences 
And protect the teachings of the victors of the three times.

And travel the path of the holy ones.

Rudrā, and ravenous vidyutā.

A ḍākinī, Caṇḍālī, and Tārā. 
You tame through rites of pacifying, enriching, enthralling, and assault, 
And display the colors white, yellow, green, black, and red. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-091-069-390,folio:F.210.b}}}

Are skilled in severing the sense organs, 
Are similarly skilled in killing all enemies,{{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-091-069-291}}}

While knowing well that the mind is not killed.

With the attributes of a bodhisattva,
And have been prophesied by the thus-gone ones.
Glorious Lady who protects the world,
You are a friend to those who preserve the holy Dharma.

They will benefit beings, 
Come to possess insight and compassion,
And be protected by those who delight in the Dharma.
They will attain siddhi
And become thus-gone ones born from jewels. 
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-091-069-305}}}“Those who bear in mind 
The one hundred and eight names 
Of the glorious bodhisattva, Śrīdevī Kālī,
Will attain one hundred and eight qualities. 
They will perfect their body, speech, and mind,
And become dharma kings of the three realms.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-091-069-189}}}When this was said, Śrīdevī Mahākālī and those in the assembly of bodhisattvas were amazed, and rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.
