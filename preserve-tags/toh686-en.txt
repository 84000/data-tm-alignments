Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One stayed on Potala Mountain, in the palace of Avalokiteśvara adorned with various trees such as sal, tamāla, campaka, aśoka, and atimuktaka. He stayed there together with the congregation of eight thousand monks, surrounded and attended upon by nine hundred and ninety quadrillion crores of bodhisattvas and many hundreds of thousands of gods of the Pure Abode. He was explaining the Dharma, chiefly to the gods such as Īśvara, Maheśvara, and Brahmā. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-092-001-6446,folio:F.2.a,volume:V92}}}{{note:{index13,id:UT22084-092-001-34}}}{{note:{index14,id:UT22084-092-001-35}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-092-001-36}}}At that time, Noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva great being, rose from his seat, draped his upper garment over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, and bowed toward the Blessed One with folded hands. Smiling, he said to the Blessed One, “Ninety-one eons ago, in the world sphere called Vilokitā, I obtained from the Tathāgata Lokendrarāja this heart essence of Amoghapāśa called Amogharāja. Through this heart essence, many thousands of gods of the Pure Abode, the chief of them being Īśvara and Maheśvara, were established in perfect supreme awakening, and I myself obtained tens of hundreds of thousands of samādhis, the most important being the display of unconfused knowledge. The place where this heart essence is introduced, O Blessed One, will be known as one where twelve thousand gods, headed by Īśvara, Maheśvara, and Brahmā, remain in order to guard, protect, and preserve it, and where the Blessed One remains, worshiped in the form of a caitya, and causes this heart essence, the unfailing cause of good fortune, to spread.{{note:{index15,id:UT22084-092-001-37}}}{{note:{index16,id:UT22084-092-001-38}}}{{note:{index17,id:UT22084-092-001-39}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-092-001-40}}}“Any being who hears this heart essence of Amoghapāśa, O Blessed One, will have roots of virtue planted in them by hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of buddhas.  O Blessed One, any follower of an evil doctrine who speaks ill of the noble ones, rejects the true Dharma, opposes the buddhas, the bodhisattvas, the śrāvakas, and the pratyekabuddhas, and is headed for the Avīci hell because of the offenses he commits will be stricken with remorse and will later  take up the conduct of restraint. If he occasionally fasts and recites this mantra, he will purify, exhaust, and purge his karma in this very life. He will thus exhaust the karma of fever that returns every day, or every two, three, four, or six days; the karma of sore eyes, earache, sinusitis, toothache, sore lips, tongue, or palate, chest pain, stomachache, back pain, or pain in the flanks  or in the limbs and extremities; the karma of asthma attacks, dysentery, problems with the hands, feet, or nose, headache, leprosy, white leprosy, black leprosy, scabies, lice, pus boils, fistula, or blisters; the karma of epilepsy or attacks by kākhordas or other evil spirits; and the karma of being killed, imprisoned, beaten, threatened, or falsely accused. In short, O Blessed One, he will completely remove any karma of physical or mental pain or of nightmares. How much more will this be true for beings who are pure and have faith and trust!{{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-092-001-6447,folio:F.2.b,volume:V92}}}{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-092-001-41}}}{{note:{index19,id:UT22084-092-001-42}}}

It will become the cause of virtue for any beings who visualize thousands of buddhas from the ten directions appearing before them and confess to them their wrongdoings . . . and so on up to ‘write this mantra in the form of a book and keep it safe in their homes.’ Even if, O Blessed One, as anyone learned would know, they listen to the heart essence because they fear their master, have to comply with someone else, or fear ridicule, the words of the heart essence will fall on their ears through the blessing of Noble Avalokiteśvara.{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-092-001-6448,folio:F.3.a,volume:V92}}}{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-092-001-44}}}{{note:{index21,id:UT22084-092-001-45}}}{{note:{index22,id:UT22084-092-001-46}}}

If I am cursed at or reviled, I do not lose my fragrance. In exactly the same way, my heart essence of Amoghapāśa retains its pleasant fragrance too. As for any being who laughs at or makes fun of my heart essence of Amoghapāśa . . . and so on until ‘worships it, even if done with guile,’ for such unruly beings this heart essence will become the cause of virtue. Those for whom this heart essence arises become inseparable from it. It makes them fragrant with moral discipline, as they gather the accumulations of merit and wisdom through discipline and samādhi.

(2) One’s body will become smooth and beautiful. (3) One will be loved by many people. (4) One will be able to control one’s senses. (5) One will acquire things, and when one has thus accumulated wealth, (6) no thief will be able to take it. (7) One’s wealth cannot be burned by fire, borne away by flood, or forcefully seized by the king. (8) One’s endeavors will be successful. (9) There will be no danger from fire or water. (10) There will be no danger from wind or rain. (11) If one incants ash or water seven times with the heart mantra of Amoghapāśa and demarcates the borders of an area, thus delimiting the cardinal and intermediate directions and above and below, all calamities will be pacified. (12) No life-draining spirits will be able to steal one’s vitality. (13) One will be dear to and captivate all beings. (14) There will be no danger from enemies, and should such danger arise, it will soon fade away. (15) There will be no danger from nonhuman beings, (16) kākhordas, or (17) ḍākinīs. (18) No acute afflictions and their subsidiaries will arise. (19) One will not die by fire, weapons, or poison.  (20) The deities will stand by to guard, protect, and defend. (21) Wherever one may be born, one will never be separated from loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. These are the twenty-one benefits that are highly desirable. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-092-001-6450,folio:F.4.a,volume:V92}}}{{note:{index24,id:UT22084-092-001-51}}}{{note:{index25,id:UT22084-092-001-52}}}

(1) At the time of one’s death, Noble Avalokiteśvara will appear before one in the garb of a monk. (2) One will die with ease. (3) One will not stray from the right view. (4) When dying, one’s hands and feet will not thrash about, one will not soil oneself with excrement, and one will not fall off the bed. (5) One will remain completely lucid. (6) One will not die face down. (7) One’s presence of mind will not fail. (8) One will be reborn in whatever buddha field one aspires to, and there one will not be separated from a virtuous friend.
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-092-001-54}}}“A serious practitioner should recite the heart mantra of Amoghapāśa three times, at the three junctions of the day, every day. He should avoid food that contains alcohol, meat, onions, leeks, or garlic, as well as stale food. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of sentient beings, he should teach to them the heart mantra of Amoghapāśa as part of a Dharma discourse. The teacher must not be tight fisted, as only those who are free from greed and jealousy can become bodhisattvas who bring benefit to beings; they attain the realization of the Buddha and are then counted among the bodhisattvas. Bodhi is said to be wisdom, and sattva is the means. Lest sentient beings not obtain these two qualities, may the Blessed One permit me to chant in front of the Tathāgata this heart mantra for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the fourfold assembly and the others who commit evil.”{{note:{index26,id:UT22084-092-001-55}}}{{note:{index27,id:UT22084-092-001-56}}}

In book 10, material was added beginning with the words “it can accomplish the goal of any activity” and ending with “perform the mantra recitation excellently.” In book 12, material was added beginning with the words “moreover, Blessed One, for the sake of the distinctive purpose” and ending with “the body of the vidyā holder will blaze.” In book 13, material was added beginning with the words “by merely hearing this maṇḍala rite” and ending with “excavate an area the size of a human.” In book 14, material was added beginning with the words “incant lotus, water, and mustard seeds” and ending with “wash with a white cloth.” At the transition to book 15, material was added beginning with the words “eight silver vessels” and ending with “in all other types of places he will perform any tasks he sets his mind to.” At the break between books 16 and 17, material was added beginning with the words “now I will teach the homa procedure” and ending with “the mudrā rite and the rite for practice.” Finally, at the break between what was called book 17 and book 18, material was added beginning with “now I will teach a maṇḍala rite that involves continuous recitation” and ending with “the homa will release the light rays of the protector of the world.” These omissions were rectified, and the conclusion completed by the Śākya monk Rinchen Drup.
