{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-093-018-67}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-093-018-266,folio:F.165.b}}} Homage to blessed Vajradhara.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at the noble Lord Avalokiteśvara’s palace at the summit of Mount Potala. That bejeweled palace was ornamented with countless jewels, pearls, and gems, the light of which filled the trichiliocosm. In that region filled with the delightful scent of all kinds of flowers, the Blessed One was seated on a lion throne that had been arranged for him, surrounded by countless bodhisattvas led by Maitreya, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-093-018-267,folio:F.166.a}}} as well as many monks led by the great śrāvaka Śāradvatīputra. In that assembly was the bodhisattva great being Mañjuśrī, who rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and prostrated his head at the Blessed One’s feet. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-093-018-70}}}He said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, in the land of Magadha there is a king named Lord of Light who has an excellent retinue, queens, and abundant wealth. But beyond this, the king is afflicted with leprosy, boils, difficulty breathing, and heart disease. How can he be healed?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-093-018-71}}}The Blessed One replied, “Bodhisattva great being Mañjuśrī, long ago in this very world you, Mañjuśrī, were a bodhisattva called Great Wisdom, and noble Avalokiteśvara Siṃhanāda was a bodhisattva called Supreme Compassion. Those two bodhisattvas tamed a white lion, mounted it, and rode out to help beings of the trichiliocosm. They set out adorned with precious adornments and holding a trident, sword, lotus, and an utpala flower. But when the time came to cross the great ocean, they left the lion behind, shared the load, and continued onward. You, the bodhisattva Great Wisdom, thinking to benefit your friend, took your own life with your sword. But the bodhisattva Supreme Compassion thought that you had been killed by the nāgas, gods, and the like, who dwell in the heavens, below the earth, and in the sky. He then took up a brahmin’s skull as a drinking vessel, took his trident in his hand, and mounted the white lion. In sorrow, he bound his locks upon his crown. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-093-018-72}}}“He threatened the gods above while brandishing his trident at them, and said, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-093-018-268,folio:F.166.b}}}

If this is the fault of all the gods, I will punish them. 
I will destroy their towns and kill the gods!’

By destroying their towns and killing the eight classes!’ 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-093-018-77}}}“He then brandished his trident at the eight classes. The nāga king Jeweled Crown, the gandharva king Pañcaśikha, the yakṣa king Vaiśravaṇa, the asura king Vemacitrin, the horse-headed kinnara king Druma, the kumbhāṇḍa king Nine-Headed Snake, the garuḍa king Golden Eyes, and the rest, together with their large retinues, beamed with joy and offered jeweled ornaments to the lion.

The nāga king Anavatapta, the nāga king Varuṇa, the nāga king Takṣaka, and the other six hundred thousand nāga kings, and their servants and retinues, who have miraculous powers, are radiant, and who cause the gods and asuras to battle all gathered together, beamed with joy. {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-093-018-269,folio:F.167.a}}} The nāga king Varuṇa became a single white snake, bowed down, circumambulated the bodhisattva three times, and said, 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-093-018-81}}}“‘Compassionate bodhisattva,
I take refuge in you. 
Be the protector of all nāgas!
You may kill us if we commit an offense.’
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-093-018-82}}}“Saying this he wrapped himself around the trident three times, turned to face the bodhisattva, said, ‘phuḥ phuḥ!’ respectfully bled from his mouth, and remained there.

{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-093-018-85}}}“Saying this, the eight great nāgas became a single white snake and bound themselves around him as a sacred thread. Those nāga kings then said, ‘We are your servants. We will listen to whatever you command.’ Then all the nāgas returned to their own places.
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-093-018-86}}}“Mañjuśrī, that bodhisattva then became known as Compassionate Nāga Tamer, and as Heart Disease Healer. Mañjuśrī, indeed that bodhisattva Great Wisdom of former times is none other than you, Mañjuśrī Vādisiṃha. And the one who at that time was the bodhisattva Supreme Compassion is now Noble Avalokiteśvara Siṃhanāda, the great leader of the nāgas, himself.

Removes harm, and grants fearlessness. 
Holding an utpala flower, she embodies compassion—
I bow before she who sends forth many emanations.
