Surata’s Questions
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-043-008-25}}} Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-043-008-295,folio:F.181.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-008-26}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in Prince Jeta’s Grove at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, together with a great monastic assembly of one thousand two hundred and fifty monks and with thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas. He was venerated, revered, honored, and worshiped by the fourfold community, as well as by the king, ministers, townsfolk, and citizens.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-008-27}}}At that time in Śrāvastī there lived a poor city-dweller named Surata. He had unshakable faith in the Buddha, unshakable faith in the Dharma, and unshakable faith in the Saṅgha. He held to the five basic precepts and adhered to the ten virtuous actions. Being kind, he was equanimous toward all sentient beings. Being compassionate, he was indefatigable. Being joyful, he reveled in and longed for the bliss of Dharma. Being impartial, he was unmoved by happiness or suffering. He was dedicated to the pursuit of unsurpassable, perfect awakening, and was perfected through previous practice. Through skillful means, he brought sentient beings to full maturity, despite being considered poor.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-008-28}}}Śakra, lord of the gods, beheld the poor city-dweller Surata with his divine eye, whose clarity surpasses any human’s. Śakra perceived that he had few desires, that he was content, that he had ethical discipline and was morally upright, that his mind was unperturbed, that he always wore a smile, that he did not judge others for their mistakes,  that he cared for the mental welfare of all sentient beings, that he was not covetous, that he acted mindfully, that he was content, easily fulfilled, and easily sated, that he had good intentions, that he was not deceitful, that he was not conceited, that he was eloquent, that he was respectful, that he continually observed the eight precepts, that he carried a bowl made of leaves in his hands, that he slept on a grass mat, that he wore tattered garments, that he would not take things he chanced upon, that he would share his food no matter its quality, that he had regard for the Tathāgata at all times, that he wanted to hear the Dharma, that he was inspired by various parables, and that when sentient beings saw him, they were happy.{{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-043-008-296,folio:F.181.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-043-008-29}}}Seeing this, Śakra, lord of the gods, thought to himself, “Let me examine whether this poor city-dweller’s moral resolve is firm.” He then emanated a crowd of people who abused and rebuked the poor city-dweller Surata with offensive words. Surata patiently tolerated their threats, even as they brandished clumps of earth, sticks, and blades; he was neither irritated, nor gave rise to malicious thoughts.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-043-008-30}}}Śakra, lord of the gods, then emanated another crowd in front of Surata. With kind words, they said to him, “We would like to help you. If you wish, we will exterminate all the enemies who threaten you.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-043-008-31}}}“Friends, don’t say such things!” replied Surata. “Even if those people were to cut my body into a hundred pieces, I still would not think badly of them. Friends, in the various worlds, there are two types of beings, the virtuous and the nonvirtuous. The virtuous ones have happy rebirths, and the nonvirtuous ones have miserable rebirths. Therefore, since I don’t even want to get angry with them, how could I harm them physically?”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-043-008-32}}}Surata then spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-043-008-33}}}“When the seeds are bitter,
They will bear bitter fruit. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-043-008-297,folio:F.182.a}}}
When the seeds are sweet,
They will bear sweet fruit.
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-043-008-34}}}“Applying this analogy,
A wise person understands
The bitterness of the ripening of sins
And the sweetness of the fruits of white deeds.{{note:{index3,id:UT22084-043-008-35}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-043-008-36}}}“You should never commit the three kinds of sins
With your body, speech, or mind!
And when others commit them,
The wise should not rejoice!
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-043-008-37}}}“You should always perform the three white deeds
With your body, speech, and mind!
And when others perform virtues, 
You should rejoice in them!”
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-043-008-38}}}Then, on another occasion, Śakra, lord of the gods, showed Surata a heap of jewels and gold and said, “Surata, use these to make donations and make merit! Get some clothes and jewelry! Why should you be poor and wretched?”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-043-008-39}}}“Friends,” said Surata, “because I performed evil deeds in the past toward sentient beings with my body, speech, and mind, I am now considered poor. Therefore, I don’t want to take what is not given to me.”{{note:{index4,id:UT22084-043-008-40}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-043-008-41}}}“Surata, now is the time to be living happily!” Śakra insisted. “Why are you thinking of the world beyond?”
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-043-008-42}}}“Friend,” replied Surata, “living for the sake of this life is the way of childish beings. The wise live for the sake of their next life. Those who are possessed by desire, possessed by hatred, possessed by delusion, and possessed by lust take what is not given to them, whereas the wise are not covetous. Those who live for the sake of hoarding take what is not given to them, whereas the wise do not hoard. Those who hold concepts of ‘mine’ and who are possessive take what is not given to them, whereas the wise do not hold concepts of ‘mine’ and are not possessive. Those who focus on their bodies and vitality take what is not given to them, whereas the wise do not focus on their bodies and vitality.  Those who are not satisfied and not contented take what is not given to them, whereas the wise know satisfaction and contentment. Those who live impurely take what is not given to them, whereas the wise live purely. Those who do not have insight into karma take what is not given to them, whereas the wise have insight into karma. Those who live for the sake of harming others take what is not given to them, whereas the wise live for the sake of not harming others. Those who do not have loving attitudes take what is not given to them, whereas the wise have loving attitudes. Those whose minds are polluted by the four wrong views take what is not given to them, whereas the minds of the wise are not wrong. Moreover, may the poor heed these verses!{{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-043-008-298,folio:F.182.b}}}

The childish praise sin;

{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-043-008-47}}}Then, on another occasion, Śakra, lord of the gods, emanated another person who brought a pile of gold to Surata and said, “Hey Surata, I’ve brought this gold for you. I’m in the midst of a dispute with someone and only you can act as my witness. You need to be my witness!”
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-043-008-48}}}Surata replied, “Give it up, my friend! Don’t say that! I don’t want to lie. My friend, lying would deceive not only myself and others, but the noble ones as well. Lying ruins one’s reputation. Lying makes one untrustworthy and unpleasant.  Lying makes one despicable. Lying torments one’s mind. My friend, lying gives one bad breath. Lying makes one’s body feeble. Lying makes one despised by the gods. My friend, lying steals away one’s roots of virtue. Lying dulls one’s memory. Lying blocks one’s path to fortunate rebirths. My friend, noble ones do not engage in lying. Lying makes one’s speech distasteful among truthful people. Lying is criticized by the wise. Lying is the root of all sins. Lying severs the fulfillment of one’s religious observances at the root. Lying is the root of all miserable rebirths.” {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-043-008-299,folio:F.183.a}}}{{note:{index5,id:UT22084-043-008-49}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-043-008-50}}}The poor city-dweller Surata then spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-043-008-51}}}“From the mouths of liars
Emerges foul breath.
Lying eliminates all of one’s prior white deeds,
Akin to destroying a monastery.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-043-008-52}}}“Deluded people dishearten themselves
As well as deities and noble beings.
A person who tells lies
Will always be suspect.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-043-008-53}}}“Telling a lie
Is the root of all sins.
It severs the root of ascetic practices,
And is said to be the path to miserable rebirths.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-043-008-54}}}“Even if you were to offer me gold
Enough to fill Jambudvīpa,
To protect the Dharma,
I would never tell a lie.”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-043-008-55}}}Unable to get Surata to lie, the person emanated by Śakra went away.
Then Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the goddess Sunlight and the asura Śacī,
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-043-008-57}}}“You two go test whether this practitioner of religious observances and austerities indulges in sensual gratification or if he truly doesn’t strive for pleasure!”
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-043-008-58}}}At daybreak, the asura Śacī and the goddess Sunlight went to where Surata was staying and spoke to him sweetly, “Wake up, Surata!  We’re here to serve you. Surata, behold our perfect bodies! Behold the curves, luster, and shapeliness of our bodies. Behold our bodies, anointed with unguents and adorned with ornaments, garments, and accessories! Behold how we exude the bloom of youth! Surata, behold our well-formed, perfect bodies, the kind that will please you.”{{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-043-008-300,folio:F.183.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-043-008-59}}}Seeing them, Surata said, “You two serve those in hell, the realms of animals, and Yama’s realm, but not those in the god or human realms. I see your bodies as illusory and dream-like. I see your bodies as being like foam, bubbles, and mirages. I see your bodies, anointed with sandalwood ointment, as covered in soggy flesh. I see your ornaments and garments as illusions that deceive the eyes. I see your youthfulness as impermanent and subject to change. Since I see all that to be meritless, I feel no attraction to you. You two serve those whose minds are like monkeys and those whose minds are like women’s, but you can’t serve those whose minds are protected by mindfulness.

{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-043-008-66}}}“Desire is the root of all nonvirtue.

{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-043-008-79}}}On another occasion, the poor city-dweller Surata found a priceless and precious gem. He thought to himself, “Assuredly, I should give this precious gem, the finest in Jambudvīpa, to the poorest person in Śrāvastī.” He went to the city and announced, “I will give this gem to the poorest among you.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-043-008-80}}}A crowd of neglected poor people gathered there and called out, “We are poor, so give it to us!”
“You are not poor!” countered Surata. “But there is someone else in Śrāvastī who is exceedingly poor, so I will give it to that person.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-043-008-82}}}The crowd asked, “Who?” 
“It is King Prasenajit,” replied Surata.
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-043-008-84}}}“Don’t say that!” the crowd retorted. “King Prasenajit is rich and wealthy with vast resources, whereas we are poor and neglected.”

{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-043-008-90}}}At that time, as a penalty for some minor infractions, King Prasenajit had seized the possessions of some five hundred eminent merchants and householders who were from good families.
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-043-008-91}}}The poor city-dweller Surata offered the king the precious gem and said, “Great king, I’ve found this priceless and precious gem whose worth matches that of all Jambudvīpa,  and I thought that I would give it to the poorest person in Śrāvastī.

{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-043-008-92}}}Thereupon King Prasenajit became nervous and embarrassed, and he asked the poor city-dweller Surata, “Surata, how am I even poorer than you?”
Surata replied, “O Your Majesty, it is true. You are poorer than me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-043-008-94}}}“In what way am I poor?” asked the king.
Surata then spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-043-008-96}}}“When someone has increasingly intense desires, is not contented with his own possessions,
Disturbs the kingdom by causing harm, forsakes even himself,
Fails to protect the people in his kingdom, and holds in high esteem those of meager quality,
Then those intent on the Dharma will think him poor.

Is always content with the bare necessities, has no desire,

{{milestone:{label:1.79,id:UT22084-043-008-115}}}Surata, with hands joined together,
Uncovered one shoulder, 
Knelt down on the ground,
And said these words:

The people were astonished.
The king, together with his ministers and army,
Prostrated at the Teacher’s feet.
{{milestone:{label:1.84,id:UT22084-043-008-120}}}Then thousands of other living beings
Also made offerings to the Teacher.
Making offerings to the perfect Buddha,
They mentally prostrated as well, for the sake of awakening.

Then he said, “Bhagavān, while wandering about Śrāvastī,  I found a priceless, precious gem. I decided to give it to the poorest person in Śrāvastī. I determined that King Prasenajit is the poorest, because no matter how much he plunders, he is never satisfied; he seeks riches again and again, yet it is never enough. He is never satisfied with the possessions of others; he harms those already suffering and quickly uproots the happiness of others. He leads the poor to ruin and subjugates the wealthy. He has gone completely mad! Having determined that he is completely bound by the wealth of his kingdom and by his cravings, I offered him the gem but he didn’t accept it. He asked, ‘Who could attest, on your behalf, that I am poor and you are rich?’ Therefore, O Bhagavān—who is impartial to all sentient beings, who never turns away from them, and who is without obstinacy, impurity, and enmity—Bhagavān, please tell us clearly if what I have said is true!”{{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-043-008-307,folio:F.187.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.86,id:UT22084-043-008-122}}}The Bhagavān then said, “Great king, you think yourself rich based on the resources of your kingdom that you have acquired in this life, such as gold, jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, crystals, corals, gold powder, silver, horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, cavalry, storehouses, and treasuries. Great king, Surata thinks himself rich based on his generosity, discipline, self-restraint, forbearance, gentleness, ethical discipline, religious observances, ascetic practices, conscientiousness, virtuous practices, frugality, kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity,  devotion to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, faith, ethical discipline, learning, acts of generosity, wisdom, sense of shame, modesty, stability, and vows. Great king, suppose that all the people under your authority became wealthy like you. Even added together, the mound of their collective merit could not match one hundredth the merit that Surata accumulates by walking seven steps with his discipline, learning, religious observance, ascetic practices, and conscientiousness alone. It is incomparable.”{{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-043-008-308,folio:F.187.b}}}{{note:{index8,id:UT22084-043-008-123}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.125,id:UT22084-043-008-169}}}Between Śrāvastī and Prince Jeta’s Grove, Śakra, lord of the gods, emanated a large, well-decorated pavilion that was vast, towering, and beautiful to behold; it was a beautifully adorned palace that resembled Vaijayanta, his palace in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.  At the center of the palace he emanated a wish-fulfilling tree, in front of which he emanated a well-proportioned lion throne fit for the Bhagavān, one that was beautiful to behold and covered with hundreds of thousands of divine, finely woven cotton cloths. Finally, he emanated sixty thousand seats for bodhisattvas.{{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-043-008-314,folio:F.190.b}}}

Since they were Surata’s attendants, they ornamented the Bhagavān’s lion throne. Knowing that this great assembly of people was coming, the Bhagavān emerged from the monastery and sat down on the prepared seat, surrounded by bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.
{{milestone:{label:1.127,id:UT22084-043-008-171}}}Then, the gandharva Pañcaśikha said to the goddess Sunlight, “Kind lady, come here! As an act of service to Surata, please worship the Tathāgata with string instruments and melodious songs!”

{{milestone:{label:1.137,id:UT22084-043-008-181}}}Surata, a child of the lineage, then approached the Bhagavān along with the great crowd of people. Surata bowed his head to the Bhagavān’s feet and sat to one side. King Prasenajit said to Surata, a child of the lineage, “Please sit here!” and personally offered him a well-prepared seat, which Surata accepted. King Prasenajit and his retinue also bowed their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet and took their seats. 
{{milestone:{label:1.138,id:UT22084-043-008-182}}}Thereupon, some of the gods who were unfamiliar with Surata, a child of the lineage, wondered to themselves, “Why has this shabbily dressed poor man received such abundant honors?” {{note:{index14,id:UT22084-043-008-183}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.139,id:UT22084-043-008-184}}}Śakra, lord of the gods, told those gods,  “Friends, don’t belittle him!

{{milestone:{label:1.140,id:UT22084-043-008-185}}}Realizing what those gods were thinking, Surata, a child of the lineage, made a request to the Bhagavān: “Bhagavān, please teach us the means that bodhisattvas display to bring sentient beings to maturity and the means they display to bring them to gnosis!”
{{milestone:{label:1.141,id:UT22084-043-008-186}}}The Bhagavān then emitted light rays from his body. When the light rays reached Surata, his body became over a hundred thousand times more beautiful than the perfect body of Śakra, the lord of the gods. Those gods were thunderstruck and rained flowers upon Surata.
{{milestone:{label:1.142,id:UT22084-043-008-187}}}Then the Bhagavān replied to Surata, a child of the lineage, “Surata, whenever bodhisattvas have adamantine power, they feign to be lowly for the sake of bringing sentient beings to maturity. And even when they have little power, they feign to be supreme, also for the sake of bringing sentient beings to maturity. This is their display. Immersed in gnosis, they feign ignorance, and even when feigning ignorance, their knowledge is keen. This is their display. With their physical and moral conduct, they inspire faith in those without gnosis. Showing all types of conduct, they reveal miracles to those with gnosis. This is their display. By constantly mastering their minds, they are revered by Brahmā despite manifesting as poor and destitute, and when maintaining their supreme display, they are still revered by ordinary beings. This is their display. For the sake of attracting sentient beings, they teach the poor and destitute. For the sake of inspiring sentient beings to renounce the world, they appear as renunciants, despite possessing vast wealth. This is their display.”
{{milestone:{label:1.143,id:UT22084-043-008-188}}}Thereupon, venerable Ānanda asked the Bhagavān,  “Bhagavān, what good deeds has Surata, a child of the lineage, done for the sake of awakening?”{{page:{number:23,id:UT22084-043-008-317,folio:F.192.a}}}

There is never an absence of tathāgatas.
Thus, the entire world, including the gods,
Pays respect to him in the manner of a buddha.

Surata will perform a buddha’s deeds.
Then, he will return to Abhirati, Akṣobhya’s realm,

{{milestone:{label:1.167,id:UT22084-043-008-215}}}As soon as the Bhagavān had made this prophecy about Surata, a child of the lineage, the trichiliocosm shook in six ways as divine flowers, powders, garments, and ornaments rained down. The entire retinue offered their garments to Surata, a child of the lineage. Many hundreds of merchants, householders, and brahmins were went forth as renunciants.
{{milestone:{label:1.168,id:UT22084-043-008-216}}}Thereupon Surata said to the Bhagavān, “Please permit me to go forth in the tradition of the Dharma and Vinaya that you have taught so well.”
{{milestone:{label:1.169,id:UT22084-043-008-217}}}The Bhagavān then raised his hand and blessed Surata, a child of the lineage, upon his head. The moment the Bhagavān touched his head, Surata, a child of the lineage, transformed into a monk wearing saffron robes.
{{milestone:{label:1.170,id:UT22084-043-008-218}}}Then the Bhagavān said to venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, there are five degenerations: the degeneration of time, the degeneration of sentient beings, the degeneration of place, the degeneration of lifespan, and the degeneration of mental afflictions.  In the time of these degenerations, and following my perfect awakening, no one should be disciplined in ways other than how Surata has been disciplined. {{page:{number:26,id:UT22084-043-008-320,folio:F.193.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.171,id:UT22084-043-008-219}}}“Ānanda, I don’t tame sentient beings of the Sahā world system with the Vinaya of the buddhas. Ānanda, I tame sentient beings with fears and warnings of becoming poor and destitute, or of taking lower rebirths. Ānanda, if in this world system I taught and gave instructions about the Dharma from a Buddha’s point of view, not one sentient being would be tamed and no Dharma would be realized. Therefore Ānanda, just as Surata and I tame sentient beings, so should you. Ānanda, there will be many sentient beings who will gain faith and realization; by hearing this Dharma discourse they will find faith and practice accordingly.”
