King Udayana of Vatsa’s Questions
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-043-010-68}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-043-010-360,folio:F.204.b}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Sarasvatī grove in Kauśāmbī with a great assembly of some five hundred monks and numerous bodhisattva great beings. At that time, Queen Anupamā, daughter of Mākandika, was overcome with jealousy and envy toward Queen Śyāmāvatī.
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-010-72}}}Queen Anupamā, daughter of Mākandika, addressed King Udayana of Vatsa: “Your Majesty, five hundred women, including Queen Śyāmāvatī, have committed dishonorable acts with Gautama the mendicant. I humbly request Your Majesty to act as you see fit with regard to this situation.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-010-73}}}With these lies, Queen Anupamā, daughter of Mākandika, sowed her discord. Rage, aggression, and wrath toward the Blessed One and the assembly of disciples welled up in King Udayana of Vatsa. Miserable and overcome with a wrathful fury, he drew his bow and shot a razor-sharp arrow at Queen Śyāmāvatī with murderous intent. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-010-74}}}In that instant, Queen Śyāmāvatī called out, “Homage to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha!” She prostrated herself to the Blessed One, praised him, and entered into meditative absorption on loving-kindness. {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-043-010-382,folio:F.205.a}}} Through the power of the Buddha, the razor-sharp arrow turned back and burst into flames directly above King Udayana of Vatsa’s head. As it burned and blazed, it became a single flame, sometimes moving about and sometimes standing still. Then, moving toward King Udayana of Vatsa, the arrow remained on his right side without touching his body. 
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-043-010-75}}}King Udayana of Vatsa shot two or three more arrows with the same result before Queen Śyāmāvatī said to him, “Great King, in this situation, if you were to prostrate to the Thus-Gone One, you too would find well-being.”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-043-010-76}}}Full of terror and fear, King Udayana of Vatsa became weak, and his hair stood on end. Falling to the ground, he spoke these verses to Queen Śyāmāvatī: 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-043-010-77}}}“Are you a goddess or a gandharvī?
Are you a piśācī or a rākṣasī?
How is it that I should consider you?
Answer my question thus.

For never has it missed.
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-043-010-80}}}“Whether it be monkeys or birds,

Wherever I shoot my arrow,
Never yet has it missed its mark.
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-043-010-81}}}“And yet today, this arrow that I shot
Returned back as if counteracted,
And—without any physical harm—
It came to rest right in front of me.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-043-010-82}}}“Having heeded the words of others, 
I desired to bring about your death,

Recollect your past love for me, and
Delight therein, curbing your wrath.”

{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-043-010-99}}}Inspired by Queen Śyāmāvatī, King Udayana of Vatsa, surrounded by a great assembly of people and his royal power and wealth, went to meet the Blessed One with great speed and haste. He saw the Blessed One, elegant and beautiful. The Blessed One’s sense faculties and mind were calmed, and he was completely controlled. He had perfected the most sublime tranquility meditations and the most sublime meditative concentrations. He rose above the crowd like a golden sacrificial post resplendent with glory. The Blessed One’s body was brilliant, vibrant, and beautifully adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being. Surrounded by an assembly of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, and bodhisattvas, the Blessed One was venerated by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans. Having seen that, the king approached the Blessed One and bowed at his feet.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-043-010-100}}}Addressing the Blessed One, he said, “Blessed One, I have witnessed wonders the likes of which I have never seen before. Will the Blessed One grant me the opportunity to make a request?” 
The Blessed One replied to King Udayana of Vatsa, “Great King, make a request as you wish. Speak!”
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-043-010-102}}}King Udayana of Vatsa then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One because I am attached to my desires and their cause and basis, today I was overcome with wrath and fury by the words of Queen Anupamā, daughter of Mākandika. I was overcome with thoughts of rage and anger toward the Blessed One and his assembly of disciples {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-043-010-363,folio:F.206.b}}} and shot a razor-sharp arrow at my wife Śyāmāvatī with murderous intent. When I did, it burst into flames in the sky, and as it burned and blazed, it became a single flame. As if the arrow were counteracted, it returned back to remain on my right side, without touching my body.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-043-010-103}}}“Blessed One, I bowed at the feet of my wife Śyāmāvatī, and asked her, ‘Are you a goddess, nāginī, gandharvī, piśācī, rākṣasī, or something else?’ She told me, ‘I am not a goddess, nāginī, gandharvī, piśācī, or rākṣasī. Rather, I am a disciple of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha. Out of love for you, I have rested my mind in equipoise.’ My wife Śyāmāvatī then sang the praise of the Blessed One in various ways.
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-043-010-104}}}“Then, Blessed One, I had this thought: ‘If a disciple of the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfectly awakened Buddha, is so full of compassion, loving-kindness, great superhuman power, and great marvelous strength, and is of such great distinction, then what must the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfectly awakened Buddha himself be like?’
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-043-010-105}}}“Blessed One, in that way, because I was like a fool—ignorant, unclear, and unwise—I felt rage and hatred toward the Thus-Gone One and the assembly of disciples. For this, I request your forgiveness. In the presence of the assembly of disciples, I confess my errors. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-043-010-364,folio:F.207.a}}} In the hope that you may show me compassion, I confess my errors. I request you, Blessed One, to treat me with kindness. I vow to practice restraint from this day forward.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-043-010-106}}}The Blessed One said, “Great King, rise and be seated,” and he accepted with kindness King Udayana of Vatsa who had confessed his faults. King Udayana of Vatsa bowed his head at the feet of the Blessed One and sat to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-043-010-107}}}King Udayana of Vatsa, sitting to one side, addressed the Blessed One: “Blessed One, because of how cruel, obstinate, and quick to anger I was, I have been driven to negative actions by the words of women. Because of that, Blessed One, I will go to the hell realms. Blessed One, out of compassion for me, I request the Blessed One to describe thoroughly and correctly the faults of women so that, from today onward, I will not, by any means, fall under the sway of women and be driven to negative deeds that will lead me to fall into the hell realms. It would be for the long-term benefit of myself and all sentient beings, so that we may be helped and happy. Please describe thoroughly and correctly the behaviors of women, the characteristics of women, the treachery of women, the deceitfulness of women, the dishonesty of women, the unsteadiness of women, the fickleness of women, the dependencies of women, the words of women, and the deceptiveness of women.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-043-010-108}}}The Blessed One asked King Udayana of Vatsa, “Great King, what is your purpose in asking such questions?” {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-043-010-365,folio:F.207.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-043-010-109}}}King Udayana of Vatsa responded, “Blessed One, I fall under the sway of women because they are vicious, hateful, fierce, and quick to anger. Blessed One, it is women who will lead me to the hell realms. Thus, Blessed One, please heed this request of mine.”
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-043-010-110}}}The Blessed One said to King Udayana of Vatsa, “Great King, you must first understand your own faults and then you will come to understand the faults of women.”
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-043-010-111}}}King Udayana of Vatsa responded to the Blessed One, “Excellent, Blessed One, excellent! When men possess certain faults, they fall under the sway of women. Please, Blessed One, explain these faults of men to me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-043-010-112}}}The Blessed One responded to King Udayana of Vatsa, “Yes, Great King, listen carefully and pay attention. I will now explain.”
King Udayana of Vatsa said, “Very well, Blessed One,” and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-043-010-114}}}The Blessed One addressed him, saying, “Great King, when men possess four particular faults, they fall under the sway of women. What are the four? They are as follows: 
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-043-010-115}}}“Great King, men are attached to the objects of their desire and become reckless in pursuit of them. Intoxicated by sense pleasures, they ignore the morally disciplined, virtuous, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-043-010-366,folio:F.208.a}}} and wise mendicants and brahmins and, instead, only desire to gaze upon women again and again. They do not serve, follow, or venerate the morally disciplined, virtuous, and wise mendicants and brahmins when they see them. By abandoning the morally disciplined, virtuous, and wise mendicants and brahmins, they also abandon their own faith, moral discipline, generosity, and wisdom. Those men are faithless, their discipline is faulty, they lack learning, and they are stingy. They behave like hungry spirits; they are weak-minded, attracted to open sores,{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-043-010-116}}} and involved with excrement. They delight in the smell of backsides, they enjoy filth, and they have a craving for women. They do not seek peace, they are occupied with their attachments, and they go to places where they should not. They are contemptible, they resemble maggots in excrement, and they welcome defilement. They lust after the objects of their desire, abandoning all shame and modesty. They violate the laws of gods and men, lead despicable lives, are detested by the wise, and keep company with foolish beings. They entertain negative thoughts, keep company with bad friends, are constantly engaging in bad actions, and are inclined toward bad actions. 
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-043-010-117}}}“They become controlled by women and enslaved by them. They fall under the sway of women as they become dedicated to them and live beside them. They are fixated upon orifices, dependent on orifices, and reliant on orifices. They are occupied with saliva, mucus, phlegm, snot, pus, fetid excretions,{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-043-010-118}}} cerebral secretions, and excrement. They behave like sheep, cows, chickens, dogs, pigs, jackals, and asses. They make their living by harming others. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-043-010-367,folio:F.208.b}}} They do not cherish their parents, nor do they cherish mendicants, brahmins, or others worthy of receiving offerings. They lose their faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha; they lose nirvāṇa. They enter the hells, the animal realm, and the realm of the Lord of Death—they fall to that level. They take up the bodies of lions and garuḍas. They sink to the level of the Hell of Iron-Thorn Trees and the Hell of Burning Coals. They enter the Reviving Hell, Black Line Hell, Crushing Hell, Howling Hell, Great Howling Hell, Hot Hell, Fiercely Hot Hell, and the Hell of Endless Torment.
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-043-010-119}}}“Even after hearing about these faults of women, these men feel neither anxiety nor disgust{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-043-010-120}}} when they reflect on how they laughed, cried, and felt like shouting aloud, and how they danced, sang, and played music while desiring women and keeping company with them. 
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-043-010-121}}}“Great King, such is the conduct of foolish beings. Beings with these behaviors will be reborn in the lower realms. Great King, attachment to sense pleasures is the first fault of men whereby they fall under the influence of women and are reborn in the lower realms.”
The Blessed One then spoke the following verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-043-010-123}}}“Foul and filthy, objects of desire ought to be despised. 
Dissatisfying, frightful, and impermanent, they cause suffering.
Pointlessly, these inferior things lead to one’s demise.
Thus, who among the wise would indulge their desirous cravings?
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-043-010-124}}}“Sense pleasures are utterly loathsome,
Like the stench of a cesspit brimming with excrement,

Or the loathsome charnel grounds of the dead.
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-043-010-126}}}“Just as flies, upon seeing a wound, swarm to it,
And pigs, after seeing excrement, run to it,

So, too, do the unwise delight in women.{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-043-010-127}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-043-010-128}}}“Infamous and shameful, they degrade positive qualities;
