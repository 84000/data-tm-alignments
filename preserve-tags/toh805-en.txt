{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-096-054-48}}}Subāhu paid respectful homage to the Lord of Yakṣas,{{note:{index18,id:UT22084-096-054-49}}}
Brilliant like a thousand suns 
And deeply immersed in compassion,
Then asked him how to master the collections of vidyā and mantra.

But even still have found no results through mantra.
If preparatory rites accomplish nothing at all,{{note:{index20,id:UT22084-096-054-54}}}

Myriad mantras meant to heal beings.

Opened his long eyes, brandished a flaming vajra,
And spoke these words:

Pressed their hands together in devotion, and said,
“Amazing that you have such compassion for all beings!
Amazing is your manifold activity!

Some as bearing a club, others and holding a disc,{{note:{index333,id:UT22084-096-054-811}}}{{note:{index334,id:UT22084-096-054-812}}}
Yet others as holding a trident or lasso,
Or as bearing a sword, bow, or cudgel.
For some you take a frightening form, bristling with weapons,
While others see you in a state of peace. 
{{milestone:{label:11.56,id:UT22084-096-054-813}}}“We bow to you who is venerated by devas and yakṣas,
Who takes many forms but whose form is imperceptible. 
We bow in homage to you whose feet are honored by asuras and devas,
And to whom the supreme bodhisattvas pay homage.
Lord of vidyās with bowstring drawn, we bow to you.
We all pay homage and bow to you.
From this day forward we take refuge in you.

In alignment with all you have said, 
Will swiftly dispel the gloom of poverty
And blaze as brightly as the sun. 
Limbs that do not fail, minds that do not decline,
Freedom from illness, suffering, and physical degeneration—
These are attained by those with faith in you.”

They paid homage again and again to the vajra bearer. 
They then promptly entered their aerial palace{{note:{index335,id:UT22084-096-054-816}}}
And departed through the sky just as they arrived.
{{milestone:{label:11.59,id:UT22084-096-054-817}}}Once the devas had departed,
Vajrapāṇi said to Subāhu,
“The devas have understood this sūtra,
but you must make it known in the world.”

Subāhu rose, bowed respectfully, and said,
“I will spread it far and wide in the human realm,
For it purifies, destroys evil, and is rich in good fortune.”
