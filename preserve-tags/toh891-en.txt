{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-100-047-26}}}Even if a monk or nun,
Or a male or female householder, 
Does not observe the calendar phases or astrology,
Nor bathe and observe purity strictures,
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-100-047-27}}}They will find success by maintaining this vidyā.
Yet if someone has no interest in it,
They will never be successful.
Hence, one should be greatly committed to it.
