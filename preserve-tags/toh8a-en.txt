{{milestone:{label:1,id:UT22084-014-001-chapter-1}}}Chapter 1: The Context
{{milestone:{label:1.1,id:UT22084-014-001-11}}}{{page:{number:1,id:UT22084-014-001-4592,folio:F.1.b,volume:V14}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha, with a large monastic gathering comprising some five thousand monks. All of them were arhats who had attained the cessation of contaminants, free of afflicted mental states, fully controlled, their minds thoroughly liberated, their wisdom well liberated, thoroughbreds, mighty elephants, their tasks accomplished, their work completed, their burdens relinquished, their own objectives fulfilled, the fetters binding them to the rebirth process completely severed, their minds thoroughly liberated through perfect instruction,{{note:{index:56,id:UT22084-014-001-13}}} supreme in their perfection of all mental powers, with the exception of just one person—the venerable Ānanda, a trainee who had entered the stream. Also present were some five hundred nuns—Yaśodharā and Mahāprajāpatī and so on— {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-014-001-4593,folio:F.2.a,volume:V14}}} and a great many laymen and laywomen, all of whom had seen the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-014-001-14}}}There, too, were innumerable, inestimable bodhisattva great beings, all of whom had attained the dhāraṇīs and attained the meditative stabilities, acting in accord with emptiness, their perceptual range being one of signlessness, their aspirations free from deliberation. They had attained forbearance for the sameness of all phenomena, possessed inspired eloquence that was unimpeded, had comprehended the inexhaustible teachings according to their exact knowledge, and used miraculous displays through their great extrasensory powers.{{note:{index:57,id:UT22084-014-001-15}}} With their extrasensory powers never failing, and with engaging speech, without indolence but with perseverance, without regard for their bodies or their lives, their conduct unpretentious,{{note:{index:58,id:UT22084-014-001-16}}} without fawning, and without thoughts of ulterior fame, profit, or respect, free from self-interest they taught the Dharma. They had realized and integrated the sublime acceptance of the profound dharmas,{{note:{index:59,id:UT22084-014-001-17}}} had acquired the great fearlessnesses, were without discouragement, and they had gone completely beyond all the works of Māra. Having interrupted the continuity of karmic obscurations, they had overcome karma, the afflicted mental states, and hostile forces,{{note:{index:60,id:UT22084-014-001-18}}} and in the face of all challenges had remained undefeated. They were difficult for all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to understand,{{note:{index:61,id:UT22084-014-001-19}}} and through their realization were skilled in analyzing and teaching the Dharma. They had energetically applied themselves to their aspirations over countless eons. Smiling and speaking first in welcome, their faces without frowns of anger, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-014-001-5876,folio:F.2.b,volume:V14}}} with their sweet, gentle words they were skilled in addressing others in melodic verse. As their inspired eloquence flowed uninterrupted, they possessed the fearlessness that overwhelmed endless assemblies. They were skilled in emancipation by means of the transcendental knowledge from having taught for endless tens of millions of eons.{{note:{index:62,id:UT22084-014-001-20}}} They had comprehended that all phenomena are like an illusion, a mirage, a reflection of the moon in water, a dream, an echo, an optical aberration, empty space, a castle in the sky, a reflection,{{note:{index:63,id:UT22084-014-001-21}}} and a magical display. Without discouragement, they were skilled in comprehending the mental attitudes, subtle knowledge,{{note:{index:64,id:UT22084-014-001-22}}} conduct, and interests of all beings. Their attitude toward all beings was free of any animosity, and their tolerance was immense. They were skilled in the transcendental knowledge that brings the sameness of all phenomena to be understood, and because they were possessed of profound reality their depth was hard to estimate. They had fully attained power over their own minds, and they had entirely attained power over all phenomena. They were liberated from all karma, afflicted mental states, and obscurations of view. They were skilled in teaching in dependence on the audience,{{note:{index:65,id:UT22084-014-001-23}}} and had engaged in all the inexhaustible modes of dependent origination, were free from all views, latent impulses, and obsessions, and had abandoned all fetters. They were skilled in bringing peace from all actions and afflicted mental states,{{note:{index:66,id:UT22084-014-001-25}}} skilled in the transcendental knowledge that brings realization of the truth, constantly and uninterruptedly considering all phenomena to resemble an echo, fearless in their measureless teachings of the ways of the Dharma,{{note:{index:67,id:UT22084-014-001-26}}} and skilled in bringing forth comprehension of the true nature itself.{{note:{index:68,id:UT22084-014-001-27}}} Their progress was governed by their aspirational vow to establish infinite buddhafields. Constantly and uninterruptedly they actualized the meditative stability of recollecting the buddhas {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-014-001-5877,folio:F.3.a,volume:V14}}} who reside in countless world systems; they were skilled in going everywhere buddhas arise{{note:{index:69,id:UT22084-014-001-28}}} and skilled in requesting the innumerable buddhas to teach.{{note:{index:70,id:UT22084-014-001-29}}} They were skilled in bringing about peace from the afflicted mental states that are generated through the diverse false views of beings, and skilled in bringing forth realization of the transcendental knowledge that revels in the miraculous production of a hundred thousand meditative stabilities.{{note:{index:71,id:UT22084-014-001-30}}} Every one of them had qualities of which a full description would be incomplete even if infinite eons were spent on it.

{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-014-001-40}}}At that time, the Blessed One himself arranged his seat, the lion throne, and sat upright with his legs crossed, directing his mindfulness.{{note:{index:78,id:UT22084-014-001-41}}} Seated there, he was absorbed in the meditative stability called king of meditative stabilities, in which all meditative stabilities are gathered, comprehended, pursued, and subsumed.

{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-014-001-46}}}All of those sets of sixty hundred thousand ten million billion rays of light permeated all the world systems in the great billionfold world system with a great brightness.

{{milestone:{label:1.126,id:UT22084-014-001-180}}}The Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete buddha Śākyamuni, took those lotuses and scattered them into all the world systems in the direction of the zenith, numerous as the grains of sand of the river Gaṅgā, where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas resided. Then those lotuses fully covered those world systems, and upon those lotuses many bodies of the tathāgatas were seated, teaching the doctrine that takes these very six perfections as its point of departure. All the beings who heard that teaching of the Dharma also became assured of reaching unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.

{{milestone:{label:2.187,id:UT22084-014-001-444}}}“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattva great beings speak of the defects of sense pleasures using many descriptive expressions: ‘Sense objects are all ablaze, sense objects are debased, sense objects are murderous, sense objects are inimical, sense objects are aggressive, sense objects are like a brush fire, sense objects are like the deadly kimpāka fruit, sense objects are like holding the blade of a sword, sense objects are like a heap of embers, sense objects are like poisonous leaves, sense objects are like the iron hook used by an elephant trainer, and sense objects are like a cesspit.’ 
{{milestone:{label:2.188,id:UT22084-014-001-445}}}“So it is, Śāradvatīputra, that although bodhisattva great beings are thoroughly cognizant of sense objects, in order that unskilled beings might be brought to maturation, to make them disillusioned with the five sense objects and to separate them from the five sense objects, they demonstrate the five sense objects to them, but without being intoxicated by them, nor being careless, nor engaging in negative actions that have sense objects as their cause and have sense objects as their basis.” 
{{milestone:{label:2.189,id:UT22084-014-001-447}}}The Blessed One having spoken thus, the venerable Śāradvatīputra then asked him, {{page:{number:145,id:UT22084-014-001-6012,folio:F.73.b,volume:V14}}} “Blessed Lord, how then should bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom?”
{{milestone:{label:2.190,id:UT22084-014-001-448}}}The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatīputra, in this regard, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, they do not observe a bodhisattva. Nor do they observe the term bodhisattva. Nor do they observe the conduct of a bodhisattva. Nor do they observe the perfection of wisdom. Nor do they observe the term perfection of wisdom. Nor do they observe ‘practicing,’ and neither do they observe ‘not practicing,’{{note:{index:164,id:UT22084-014-001-449}}} nor do they observe ‘practicing when they practice and not practicing when they do not practice,’ nor even do they observe ‘neither practicing nor not practicing.’ They also do not observe physical forms. Nor do they observe feelings. Nor do they observe perceptions. Nor do they observe formative predispositions. Nor do they observe consciousness. 
{{milestone:{label:2.191,id:UT22084-014-001-450}}}“If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, it is because even bodhisattvas are empty of the inherent existence of bodhisattvas. Even the term bodhisattva is empty of the term bodhisattva. If you ask why, it is because such is their inherent nature. It is not owing to emptiness that physical forms are empty,{{note:{index:165,id:UT22084-014-001-453}}} nor is emptiness anything other than physical forms. Physical forms are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed physical forms. It is not owing to emptiness that feelings are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than feelings. Feelings are indeed emptiness. {{page:{number:146,id:UT22084-014-001-6013,folio:F.74.a,volume:V14}}} Emptiness is indeed feelings. It is not owing to emptiness that perceptions are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than perceptions. Perceptions are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed perceptions. It is not owing to emptiness that formative predispositions are empty, nor is emptiness anything other than formative predispositions. Formative predispositions are indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed formative predispositions. It is not owing to emptiness that consciousness is empty, nor is emptiness anything other than consciousness. Consciousness is indeed emptiness. Emptiness is indeed consciousness. If you ask why, it is because even this ‘enlightenment’ is merely a name. Even this ‘bodhisattva’ is merely a name. Even this ‘emptiness’ is merely a name. Even this ‘physical forms’ is merely a name, even this ‘feelings’ is merely a name, even this ‘perceptions’ is merely a name, even this ‘formative predispositions’ is merely a name, even this ‘consciousness’ is merely a name. 
{{milestone:{label:2.192,id:UT22084-014-001-454}}}“And that is because physical forms are like an illusion, feelings are like an illusion, perceptions are like an illusion, formative predispositions are like an illusion, and consciousness is like an illusion.

The illusions that are seen do not really exist.{{note:{index:166,id:UT22084-014-001-455}}} They have not arisen. They are false. They are without inherent existence.

Subhūti replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, mind neither has desire, nor is it without desire; it neither has delusion, nor is it without delusion; it neither has hatred, nor is it without hatred; it neither has obsession, nor is it without obsession; it neither has obscuration, nor is it without obscuration; it neither has impediment, nor is it without impediment;{{note:{index:272,id:UT22084-014-001-2490}}} it neither has latent impulses, nor is it without latent impulses; it neither has fetters, nor is it without fetters; it neither has mistaken views, nor is it without mistaken views; it neither has śrāvakas, nor is it without śrāvakas;{{note:{index:273,id:UT22084-014-001-2491}}} and it neither has pratyekabuddhas, nor is it without pratyekabuddhas.

“Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” Subhūti asked in return, “if it is thus not mind, can existence or nonexistence be apprehended, or do they exist in that which is not mind?” 
“No, Venerable Subhūti,” he replied.
{{milestone:{label:4.38,id:UT22084-014-001-2495}}}Subhūti then asked, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, if that which is not mind has neither existence nor nonexistence, and if it cannot be apprehended, how then, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, can you be correct in asking ‘Does this mind that is not the mind exist?’ ”
