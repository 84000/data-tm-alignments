{{milestone:{label:6.164,id:UT22084-014-001-3263}}}“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, these are the meditative stabilities of bodhisattva great beings. Through engaging with those meditative stabilities bodhisattva great beings will swiftly awaken fully to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. There are also countless and inestimable other meditative stabilities and dhāraṇī gateways, like these, having trained in which bodhisattva great beings will swiftly awaken fully to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.”
{{milestone:{label:6.165,id:UT22084-014-001-3264}}}Then, through the power of the buddhas, the venerable Subhūti said, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past have indeed prophesied that those bodhisattva great beings who dwell in those meditative stabilities will fully awaken to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas presently residing and maintaining themselves in the world systems of the ten directions, {{page:{number:1157,id:UT22084-014-001-7019,folio:F.186.b,volume:V15}}} numerous as the sand particles in the Gaṅgā River, also prophesy that those bodhisattva great beings will attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.
{{milestone:{label:6.166,id:UT22084-014-001-3265}}}“But still, those bodhisattva great beings do not even observe those meditative stabilities. They do not give rise to conceit on account of those meditative stabilities, thinking, ‘I have been absorbed in meditation. I am absorbed in meditation. I will be absorbed in meditation.’ Those conceptual imaginations are absent and will not arise.”
{{milestone:{label:6.167,id:UT22084-014-001-3266}}}“Venerable Subhūti, are bodhisattva great beings who dwell in these meditative stabilities prophesied by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas?” 
{{milestone:{label:6.168,id:UT22084-014-001-3267}}}“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, they are not!” replied Subhūti. “If you ask why, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, it is because it is not that ‘the perfection of wisdom is one thing, the meditative stability another, and the bodhisattva yet another.’ Rather, the perfection of wisdom is itself the meditative stability, the meditative stability is itself the bodhisattva, and the bodhisattvas themselves are the meditative stability.”
{{milestone:{label:6.169,id:UT22084-014-001-3268}}}“Venerable Subhūti, if it is because it is not that ‘the meditative stability is one thing, and the bodhisattva another,’ and it is not that ‘the bodhisattva is one thing, and the meditative stability another,’ which is to say, if the meditative stability is itself the bodhisattva, and the bodhisattvas are themselves the meditative stability owing to the sameness of all phenomena, is it then possible to teach the meditative stability?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, it is not!” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:6.170,id:UT22084-014-001-3270}}}“Venerable Subhūti, do those children of good family {{page:{number:1158,id:UT22084-014-001-7020,folio:F.187.a,volume:V15}}} perceive these meditative stabilities?” 
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, they do not perceive them!” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:6.171,id:UT22084-014-001-3272}}}“How do they not perceive them?” 
“Because they are without conceptual thought,” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:6.172,id:UT22084-014-001-3274}}}“How are they without conceptual thought?” 
“They are without conceptual thought because all phenomena are nonexistent,” replied Subhūti. “So it is that those children of good family have no conceptual thoughts regarding those meditative stabilities. For this reason, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, those children of good family do not distinguish those meditative stabilities. They do not perceive them.”
{{milestone:{label:6.173,id:UT22084-014-001-3276}}}“Why, Venerable Subhūti, do they not distinguish and not perceive them?” 
“They do not distinguish and do not perceive them because the meditative stabilities are nonexistent, and bodhisattva great beings, also, are nonexistent,” replied Subhūti.
{{milestone:{label:6.174,id:UT22084-014-001-3278}}}Then the Blessed One congratulated the venerable Subhūti: “Excellent, excellent, Subhūti! You have spoken these words eloquently! This is an explanation by one whom I have declared to be supreme among śrāvakas abiding free of conflict. Bodhisattva great beings should also train in the perfection of wisdom in that manner. They should train in the perfection of meditative concentration, should train in the perfection of perseverance, should train in the perfection of tolerance, should train in the perfection of ethical discipline, and should train in the perfection of generosity; should train in the applications of mindfulness, should train in the correct exertions, should train in the supports for miraculous ability, {{page:{number:1159,id:UT22084-014-001-7021,folio:F.187.b,volume:V15}}} should train in the faculties, should train in the powers, should train in the branches of enlightenment, and should train in the noble eightfold path; should train in the truths of the noble ones, should train in the meditative concentrations, should train in the immeasurable attitudes, should train in the formless absorptions, should train in the liberations, should train in the serial steps of meditative absorption, should train in the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, should train in the extrasensory powers, should train in the meditative stabilities, and should train in the dhāraṇī gateways; and should train in the powers of the tathāgatas, should train in the fearlessnesses, should train in the kinds of exact knowledge, should train in great loving kindness, should train in great compassion, and should train in the distinct qualities of the buddhas.”

Having pacified the initial mental application and the sustained mental application, with inner serene confidence—which is to say, a mind that has become single-pointed—they achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration endowed with the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability. On account of having no attachment to the joy, dwelling with mindfulness and alertness in equanimity they experience the bliss with their bodies and achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration devoid of joy about which the noble ones say, ‘They are mindful, abiding in bliss, and equanimous.’ On account of having earlier abandoned the bliss, abandoned suffering, and caused mental happiness and mental unhappiness to subside, they achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration without bliss and suffering, and in which equanimity and mindfulness are utterly purified.
