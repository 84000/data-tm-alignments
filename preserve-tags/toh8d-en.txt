As many Śakras, mighty lords of the gods, as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly.

And as many gods in the realms of the Śuddhāvāsa{{note:{index:631,id:UT22084-014-001-91047}}} as there are in this great billionfold world system, together with many hundreds of thousands of one hundred million billion gods, all congregated there, in that same assembly. Yet the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Yāma realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Tuṣita realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Mahābrahmā realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, the radiance of the bodies of the gods of the Vṛhatphala realm originating through the ripening of their past actions, and the radiance of the bodies of gods in the Śuddhāvāsa realms originating through the ripening of their past actions––all those radiances—did not approach a hundredth part, did not approach a thousandth part, did not approach a hundred thousandth part, did not approach even a hundred thousand ten million billionth part of the natural radiance of the Tathāgata; they did not stand up to any number, fraction, calculation, or example of it. All those radiances of the gods, originating through the ripening of their past actions, {{page:{number:2940,id:UT22084-014-001-96028,folio:F.284.a,volume:V17}}} neither sparkled, nor gleamed, nor shone alongside the radiance of the Tathāgata’s body. The radiance of the Tathāgata’s body alone was the best among them. It was foremost. It was the greatest. It was superior. It was excellent. It was supreme. It was perfect. It was unsurpassed, and it was unexcelled.
{{milestone:{label:14.2,id:UT22084-014-001-91048}}}Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the venerable Subhūti, “Venerable monk Subhūti, the gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm, the gods of the Yāma realm, the gods of the Tuṣita realm, the gods of the Nirmāṇarati realm, and the gods of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm; the gods of the Brahmakāyika realm, the gods of the Ābhāsvara realm, the gods of the Śubhakṛtsna realm,{{note:{index:632,id:UT22084-014-001-91049}}} and the gods in the Śuddhāvāsa realms, as many as there are, have come together wanting to hear the Dharma, in order to listen to specific instruction for coming to an authoritative conclusion about this exposition{{note:{index:633,id:UT22084-014-001-91050}}} of the perfection of wisdom. How then should bodhisattva great beings dwell in the perfection of wisdom? What is the bodhisattva great beings’ perfection of wisdom? How should bodhisattva great beings train in the perfection of wisdom?”
{{milestone:{label:14.3,id:UT22084-014-001-91051}}}The venerable Subhūti then replied to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, you should therefore listen carefully and pay attention. Through the power of the buddhas, and through the blessings of the buddhas, I will explain to the bodhisattva great beings the perfection of wisdom, how bodhisattva great beings should dwell in and train in the perfection of wisdom, {{page:{number:2941,id:UT22084-014-001-96029,folio:F.284.b,volume:V17}}} and that those gods who have not yet set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment should also set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. As for those who have entered into perfect maturity,{{note:{index:634,id:UT22084-014-001-91052}}} they are not able to set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment. If you ask why, it is because a boundary to the continuum of saṃsāra has been demarcated by them. However, if they do set their minds on unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, I rejoice in them as well. Since attributes even more distinguished than the distinguished attributes are yet to be gained, I do not obstruct their virtues.{{note:{index:635,id:UT22084-014-001-91053}}}
