If you ask why, Kauśika, it is because the herbal attributes of maghī would overpower the venom of the snake. Kauśika, such is the potency of the herb maghī. Similarly, Kauśika, whatever the disputes and quarrels and contradicting of any sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom, they would all be pacified and eliminated by the brilliance of the perfection of {{page:{number:3621,id:UT22084-014-001-96706,folio:F.244.b,volume:V18}}} wisdom and by the power of the perfection of wisdom.

The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines

{{milestone:{label:20.1,id:UT22084-014-001-92055}}}Then a hundred or so rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants intent on looking for an opportunity to inflict harm approached the place where the Blessed One was. Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, had the thought, ‘These rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants intent on looking for an opportunity to inflict harm have approached the place where the Blessed One is. So that when the perfection of wisdom is being preached, those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants do not, having approached the Blessed One, create obstacles, I should by all means chant by heart as much of this perfection of wisdom as I have taken up from the Blessed One.’
{{milestone:{label:20.2,id:UT22084-014-001-92056}}}Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, chanted by heart as much of the perfection of wisdom as he had taken up from the Blessed One. Thereupon, those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants circumambulated the Blessed One from afar, in a clockwise direction, and then went back on the same path and through the same {{page:{number:3735,id:UT22084-014-001-96812,folio:F.301.b,volume:V18}}} door. 
{{milestone:{label:20.3,id:UT22084-014-001-92057}}}Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra thought, “What is the reason those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants circumambulated the Blessed One from afar, in a clockwise direction, and then went back on the same path and through the same door?”
{{milestone:{label:20.4,id:UT22084-014-001-92058}}}The Blessed One, knowing in his mind the thought occurring to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, said to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Śāradvatīputra, this is Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, focusing his thoughts, as he habitually does, on the perfection of wisdom. For that reason those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants, having circumambulated me from afar, in a clockwise direction, have gone back on that same path and through that same door. Śāradvatīputra, among those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants I do not see any with a bright mind. All those rival tīrthikas and wandering mendicants have malicious thoughts and are only intent on looking for an opportunity to inflict harm, even though they think only this assembly is the one they should come into. Śāradvatīputra, I do not see among the beings of this world, with its gods, demons, Brahmā deities, virtuous ascetics, and brahmin priests, any, while this perfection of wisdom is being taught, who would approach with thoughts of hatred, intent on looking for an opportunity to harm. It is impossible.

{{milestone:{label:20.7,id:UT22084-014-001-92063}}}Then evil Māra had the thought, “It is certain that from among these four assemblies of the tathāgata, arhat, {{page:{number:3740,id:UT22084-014-001-96817,folio:F.304.a,volume:V18}}} perfectly complete buddha that are present here, and these gods living in the desire realm and these gods living in the form realm that are also present, that there are bodhisattva great beings who will be prophesied to attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, so I should go to where the Blessed One is and create an obstacle.”
{{milestone:{label:20.8,id:UT22084-014-001-92064}}}Evil Māra, wishing to go to where the Blessed One was, then conjured up a massive army with four cohorts. Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, had the thought, “Oh! This evil Māra has conjured up a massive army with four cohorts with the wish to go to where the Blessed One is. However, this array of evil Māra’s massive army with four cohorts cannot be compared with the array of King Bimbisāra’s army with four cohorts, it cannot be compared with the arrays of the massive armies with four cohorts of King Prasenajit, the Śākyas, or the Licchavis. This evil Māra has for a long time been looking for an opportunity to inflict harm on the Blessed One, seeking for an opportunity to inflict harm with the intention of hurting beings who are engaging correctly,{{note:{index:717,id:UT22084-014-001-92065}}} so I should focus on this perfection of wisdom as is my habit and chant it by heart.”
{{milestone:{label:20.9,id:UT22084-014-001-92066}}}Thinking like that, Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, focused on this perfection of wisdom as was his habit and chanted it clearly from memory, and as Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, clearly chanted this perfection of wisdom by heart, so too, did those evil {{page:{number:3741,id:UT22084-014-001-96818,folio:F.304.b,volume:V18}}} māras go back on that same path and through that same door. 
{{milestone:{label:20.10,id:UT22084-014-001-92067}}}Then those gods of the Cāturmahārājika realm, up to the gods of the Akaniṣṭha realm, as many as there were in that assembly, conjured up many divine flowers and sets of robes that stayed in the sky, from where they sprinkled them over where the Blessed One was. Having showered them over where the Blessed One was, they said, “May the human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom for a long time, because, for as long as these human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly complete Buddha will not disappear, the Dharma will remain for a long time, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will become manifest in the world. For as long as these human beings of Jambudvīpa practice this perfection of wisdom, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas in this great billionfold world system, up to the world systems of the ten directions will not disappear, the Dharma will remain for a long time, and the precious jewel of the Saṅgha will continue to become manifest in the world. The more distinguished conduct of bodhisattva great beings will also exist. Know that the place where the sons or daughters of good families commit this perfection of wisdom to writing and make it into a book, the place where they uphold it, is endowed with luminosity.{{note:{index:718,id:UT22084-014-001-92068}}} Know that that place has a protector and is free from darkness.”
{{milestone:{label:20.11,id:UT22084-014-001-92069}}}Then the Blessed One said to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, and to the other gods, up to{{page:{number:3742,id:UT22084-014-001-96819,folio:F.305.a,volume:V18}}} those of Akaniṣṭha, “Kauśika, it is so, it is so!

{{milestone:{label:20.12,id:UT22084-014-001-92070}}}Then those gods, having conjured up many divine flowers and showered them over where the Blessed One was, made this statement: “Blessed Lord, Māra and the gods included within the class of māras who seek an opportunity to inflict harm will find no opportunity to inflict harm on any sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom. Blessed Lord, we too {{page:{number:3743,id:UT22084-014-001-99232,folio:F.305.b,volume:V18}}} will always guard, protect, and defend those sons or daughters of good families without interruption.

{{milestone:{label:20.13,id:UT22084-014-001-92071}}}Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom are not endowed with feeble roots of virtue.

Blessed Lord, those sons or daughters of good families who take up, uphold, recite, master, and focus their attention correctly on this perfection of wisdom will have venerated many buddhas, and they will have been taken care of by spiritual mentors. If you ask why, Blessed Lord, it is because it is through this, namely, the perfection of wisdom, that they must seek for all-aspect omniscience; because it is through this, Blessed Lord, namely, {{page:{number:3744,id:UT22084-014-001-96820,folio:F.306.a,volume:V18}}} all-aspect omniscience, that they must seek for the perfection of wisdom.

{{milestone:{label:24.1,id:UT22084-014-001-92850}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya said to the elder Subhūti, {{page:{number:4155,id:UT22084-014-001-97218,folio:F.117.b,volume:V19}}} “Venerable monk Subhūti, that which is the basis of meritorious action associated with the rejoicing of a bodhisattva great being;{{note:{index:772,id:UT22084-014-001-92851}}} that which is the basis of meritorious action associated with a bodhisattva great being’s rejoicing, which is dedicated, having made common cause with all beings, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything; that which is the foundation of meritorious action associated with the rejoicing of all beings; and that which is the basis of meritorious action arisen from the generosity, and the basis of meritorious action arisen from the ethical discipline and arisen from the meditation of the followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas and the followers of the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas—from among these, just that basis of meritorious action associated with a bodhisattva great being’s rejoicing, which is dedicated, having made common cause with all beings, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment is said to be supreme, is said to be the best, is said to be the foremost, is said to be excellent, is said to be perfect, is said to be the greatest, is said to be unsurpassed, is said to be unexcelled, is said to be unequaled, and is said to be equal to the unequaled.
{{milestone:{label:24.2,id:UT22084-014-001-92852}}}“If you ask why, it is because the basis of meritorious action arisen from the generosity, and the basis of meritorious action arisen from the ethical discipline and arisen from the meditation of the followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas and the followers of the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas are simply established for their personal discipline, for their personal peace, and for their personal attainment of complete nirvāṇa. The applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, {{page:{number:4156,id:UT22084-014-001-97219,folio:F.118.a,volume:V19}}} and the four truths of the noble ones, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable attitudes, the four formless absorptions, the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, the eight liberations, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the four kinds of exact knowledge, and the six extrasensory powers, are also simply established for their personal discipline, for their personal peace, and for their personal attainment of complete nirvāṇa. On the other hand, when it comes to the bodhisattva, the basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing has been dedicated, having made common cause with all beings, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of not apprehending anything, in order that all beings might be disciplined, brought to peace, and attain final nirvāṇa.” 
{{milestone:{label:24.3,id:UT22084-014-001-92853}}}Then the venerable Subhūti said to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “There are the roots of virtue, whatever they are, as many as there are, associated with the six perfections of those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the eastern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the southern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the western direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of {{page:{number:4157,id:UT22084-014-001-97220,folio:F.118.b,volume:V19}}} the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the northern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate northeastern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate southeastern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate southwestern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the intermediate northwestern direction; those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the direction below; and those immeasurable, countless lord buddhas who have passed into complete nirvāṇa in each world system of the countless, immeasurable, and boundless world systems of the direction above, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment, up to fully awakening to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, up to when they passed into final nirvāṇa {{page:{number:4158,id:UT22084-014-001-97221,folio:F.119.a,volume:V19}}} in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no aggregates are left behind, and up until the disappearance of their Dharma. There are the basis of meritorious action arisen from generosity, the basis of meritorious action arisen from ethical discipline, the basis of meritorious action arisen from meditation, those uncontaminated roots of virtue of those learning, and those uncontaminated roots of virtue of those not learning, who are followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas. And there is the aggregate of ethical discipline, the aggregate of meditative stability, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation of those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas; altruism and great compassion; the countless and immeasurable attributes of the buddhas; and those roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those who, having trained in that Dharma, attained the fruit of having entered the stream, attained the fruit of once-returner, attained the fruit of non-returner, attained arhatship, attained individual enlightenment, and entered into the maturity of the bodhisattvas. Bodhisattva great beings gather together all of those roots of virtue, as many as there are, generated on account of those tathāgatas, whether they are present, or whether they have passed into complete nirvāṇa; rejoice with the rejoicing that is excellent, foremost, best, supreme, perfect, greatest, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unequaled, and equal to the unequaled; and, having rejoiced in that manner, having made common cause with all beings, dedicate that basis of meritorious action associated with rejoicing to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment with, {{page:{number:4159,id:UT22084-014-001-97222,folio:F.119.b,volume:V19}}} ‘May it bring about unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.’ And when those who have set out in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas in that manner have dedicated in those words and with that sort of thought, are those bases and those objective referents—the bases and objective referents on account of which that sort of thought has arisen—apprehended in the way they are when they have been made into mental images by those children of good families?”
{{milestone:{label:24.4,id:UT22084-014-001-92854}}}Maitreya replied, “Just like the dedication, having made a mental image, to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by those children of good families who are followers of the bodhisattvas’ Great Vehicle, similarly, those bases and those objective referents are not apprehended.”
{{milestone:{label:24.5,id:UT22084-014-001-92855}}}Subhūti then said, “If the lord buddhas are present in the world systems of the ten directions on account of such nonexistent bases and nonexistent objective referents, and if their roots of virtue, as many as there are, from the time they first set their mind on enlightenment to as long as their Dharma remains; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those sons and daughters of good families who are the followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those learning; and the roots of virtue, as many as there are, of those not learning were all to have been gathered and compressed together and to have been dedicated to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment by way of mental images, well then, it would be like the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of the impermanent as ‘permanent’; the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of suffering as ‘happiness’; the mistaken perception, mistaken thought, and mistaken view of nonself as ‘a self’; and the mistaken perception, {{page:{number:4160,id:UT22084-014-001-97223,folio:F.120.a,volume:V19}}} mistaken thought, and mistaken view of the impure as ‘pure.’ Would the perception of those not be mistaken like that?

{{milestone:{label:24.8,id:UT22084-014-001-92858}}}Maitreya replied, “If bodhisattva great beings practice the practice of the six perfections, wait on many buddhas, generate the roots of virtue, have been assisted by spiritual mentors, and have trained in all phenomena being empty of their own defining characteristics, they do not dedicate to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment having made a mental image of those bases, those objective referents, those buddhas, those roots of virtue, {{page:{number:4163,id:UT22084-014-001-97226,folio:F.121.b,volume:V19}}} and those bases of meritorious action associated with rejoicing.
