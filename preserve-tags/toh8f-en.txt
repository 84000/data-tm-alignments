{{milestone:{label:26.1,id:UT22084-014-001-93266}}}Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, where do those bodhisattva great beings who have a resolute belief in this profound perfection of wisdom pass away before coming here? For how long have these sons or daughters of good families set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment? How many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas have they served? For how long have those with a resolute belief in this profound perfection of wisdom as reality and as method{{note:{index:803,id:UT22084-014-001-93267}}} practiced the perfection of generosity? For how long have they practiced the perfection of ethical discipline? For how long have they practiced the perfection of tolerance? For how long have they practiced the perfection of perseverance? For how long have they practiced the perfection of meditative concentration? And for how long have they practiced the perfection of wisdom?”

Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings have practiced the perfection of generosity, practiced the perfection of ethical discipline, practiced the perfection of tolerance, practiced the perfection of perseverance, practiced the perfection of meditative concentration, and practiced the perfection of wisdom for a hundred thousand ten million billion countless, immeasurable, and boundless eons. They set out for unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment a hundred thousand ten million billion countless, immeasurable, and boundless eons ago, and from the time when they first set their mind on enlightenment they have practiced the perfection of generosity and come here, have practiced the perfection of ethical discipline and come here, have practiced the perfection of tolerance and come here, have practiced the perfection of perseverance and come here, have practiced the perfection of meditative concentration and come here, and have practiced the perfection of wisdom and come here.

Śāradvatīputra, when those bodhisattva great beings see or hear this perfection of wisdom, they will set their mind on, ‘I have seen the Teacher.’ They will set their mind on, ‘I have heard the Teacher.’ {{page:{number:4554,id:UT22084-014-001-97614,folio:F.317.a,volume:V19}}} Śāradvatīputra, those bodhisattva great beings will follow this perfection of wisdom as reality and as method by way of nonduality and not apprehending anything.”

{{milestone:{label:26.5,id:UT22084-014-001-93275}}}Subhūti asked, “Blessed Lord, for how long have bodhisattva great beings who make an effort at{{note:{index:807,id:UT22084-014-001-93276}}} this profound perfection of wisdom been practicing?”
{{milestone:{label:26.6,id:UT22084-014-001-93277}}}“Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “here there is a distinction that must be explained.{{note:{index:808,id:UT22084-014-001-93278}}} Subhūti, there are some bodhisattva great beings who, commencing from the time when they first set their mind on enlightenment, make an effort at this profound perfection of wisdom by way of not apprehending anything, make an effort at the perfection of meditative concentration, make an effort at the perfection of perseverance, make an effort at the perfection of tolerance, make an effort at the perfection of ethical discipline, and make an effort at make an effort at the perfection of generosity, and, because they see neither increase nor decrease, do not abandon any phenomenon at all, are never be separated from the six perfections, and are never be separated from {{page:{number:4558,id:UT22084-014-001-97618,folio:F.319.a,volume:V19}}} the lord buddhas. They will also accomplish those roots of virtue––the roots of virtue on account of which they want to serve, respect, honor, and worship the lord buddhas—simply by setting the mind. They proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield, are never reborn in the womb of a mother, are never separated from the extrasensory powers, do not entertain any afflicted mental state, and do not abide in the mind of śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. They bring beings to maturity, refine a buddhafield, and proceed from buddhafield to buddhafield. Subhūti, in those sorts of ways those sorts of bodhisattva great beings make an effort at this profound perfection of wisdom. 
{{milestone:{label:26.7,id:UT22084-014-001-93279}}}“Subhūti, there are also other sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have seen many hundreds of buddhas, many thousands of buddhas, many hundred ten million billions of buddhas, and who, in their presence, by way of apprehending things, have undertaken acts of generosity, maintained ethical discipline, cultivated tolerance, undertaken perseverance, developed meditative concentration, and cultivated wisdom. When this profound perfection of wisdom is being taught, they will depart elsewhere from the assembly. When this profound perfection of wisdom is being taught, these sons or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, without honoring them, depart elsewhere from the presence of those lord buddhas. If you ask why, it is because those sons of good families {{page:{number:4559,id:UT22084-014-001-97619,folio:F.319.b,volume:V19}}} or daughters of good families in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas departed elsewhere from the assembly in the past when this profound perfection of wisdom was being taught, so also, at this present time, they depart elsewhere from the assembly when this profound perfection of wisdom is being taught. They will not behave appropriately, physically or mentally,. They amass karma that will make them become intellectually stupid, and because they have made and amassed karma that will make them intellectually stupid, when this profound perfection of wisdom is taught, they will abandon it. By abandoning this perfection of wisdom, they will have abandoned the all-aspect omniscience of the lord buddhas of the past, the future, and the present. By having accrued and accumulated the karma that comes from abandoning all-aspect omniscience, and having accrued and accumulated the karma that leads to the destruction of the Dharma, they will roast{{note:{index:809,id:UT22084-014-001-93280}}} in the hells for many years, for many hundred years, for many thousand years, for many hundred thousand years; for many ten million years, for many hundred ten million years, for many thousand ten million years, and for many hundred ten million billion years.

Śāradvatīputra, those who think they should hear the words of such individuals, or think they should trust in them, will also be destitute on account of their unseemly fears.

Why would I mention their associating with it? I have not mentioned that. If you ask why, Śāradvatīputra, you should know that such individuals as these defame the Dharma. Śāradvatīputra, you should know that such individuals as these are the stupid type, are the type on the dark side. Śāradvatīputra, those who think they should listen to the words of such individuals, or think they should trust in them are misled{{note:{index:813,id:UT22084-014-001-93296}}} and will be ruined by calamities.{{note:{index:814,id:UT22084-014-001-93297}}} Śāradvatīputra, you should know that those who defame the perfection of wisdom {{page:{number:4564,id:UT22084-014-001-97625,folio:F.322.a,volume:V19}}} defame the Dharma. You should know that they are in the hells, in the animal realms, or in the world of Yama.”
{{milestone:{label:26.19,id:UT22084-014-001-93299}}}Śāriputra said, “Blessed Lord, you have not yet spoken of the measure of the body{{note:{index:815,id:UT22084-014-001-93300}}} of those who are reborn as individuals who have defamed the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:26.20,id:UT22084-014-001-93301}}}“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “do not speak about the measure of the body of those individuals who have defamed the Dharma and been reborn there.{{note:{index:816,id:UT22084-014-001-93302}}} If you ask why, it is because if one hears about the measure of the body of those individuals who have defamed the Dharma would one immediately vomit blood, die, experience life-threatening sufferings, be pained with sorrow, or become dried up and shriveled like a plant that has been scythed. If one were to hear about the measure of the body of such individuals and persons, there would simply be such misfortune as that.” Having said about the measure of their body, ‘That is that,’ the Blessed One refused to take the opportunity put by the venerable Śāradvatīputra.
{{milestone:{label:26.21,id:UT22084-014-001-93303}}}Śāriputra said, “Blessed Lord, please, I request you to explain, because, by saying, ‘This is the sort of measure of the body that those who have made and amassed the karma that leads to the destruction of the Dharma will obtain,’ it will be apparent for beings of the future.”
{{milestone:{label:26.22,id:UT22084-014-001-93304}}}“Śāradvatīputra,” replied the Blessed One, “it will be made apparent to the beings of the future just by having done this, saying that those individuals who have made, accumulated, carried out fully,{{note:{index:817,id:UT22084-014-001-93305}}} completed, taken on, and brought to fulfillment the karma that leads to the destruction of the Dharma will experience sufferings in the hells for so long,{{note:{index:818,id:UT22084-014-001-93306}}} will experience sufferings in the animal for so long, and will experience sufferings in the world of Yama {{page:{number:4565,id:UT22084-014-001-97626,folio:F.322.b,volume:V19}}} for so long.”

Blessed Lord, because of just that, bright individuals belonging to good families will abandon such errors. With the thought, ‘Let it not come about that we will experience such sufferings,’ they will not abandon the Dharma, even for the sake of their own lives.”
{{milestone:{label:26.24,id:UT22084-014-001-93308}}}Then the venerable Subhūti said to the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, when sons or daughters of good families hear this description of the errors of those individuals who abandon the Dharma, they should be absolutely restrained in physical, verbal, and mental actions, thinking, ‘Otherwise we shall experience such sufferings in the terrible forms of life,{{note:{index:819,id:UT22084-014-001-93309}}} we too shall not behold the Tathāgata, not hear the Dharma, and not wait on and venerate the Saṅgha, we shall be born in buddhafields where buddhas have not appeared, be impoverished human beings, and be extremely avaricious,’ and so on.”
{{milestone:{label:26.25,id:UT22084-014-001-93311}}}Again, the venerable Subhūti spoke to the Blessed One: “Blessed Lord, the karma of speech they have made and amassed becomes karma that has been made and amassed that leads to the destruction of the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:26.26,id:UT22084-014-001-93312}}}“Subhūti,” said the Blessed One, “those who have made and amassed the karma of speech [that defames the Dharma] have made and amassed the karma that leads to the destruction of the Dharma. Subhūti, even those deluded persons who intend to defame this perfection of wisdom and intend to reject it will go forth to homelessness in this very Dharma and Vinaya. Subhūti, by defaming and rejecting the perfection of wisdom, they defame and reject the enlightenment of the lord buddhas. By defaming and rejecting the enlightenment of the buddhas, {{page:{number:4566,id:UT22084-014-001-97627,folio:F.323.a,volume:V19}}} they defame and reject the all-aspect omniscience of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly complete buddhas of the past, the future, and the present. By defaming and rejecting all-aspect omniscience, they defame and reject the Dharma. By defaming and rejecting the Dharma, they reject the saṅgha. By rejecting the saṅgha, they reject mundane right view.{{note:{index:820,id:UT22084-014-001-93313}}} By rejecting mundane right view, they reject the perfection of generosity, reject the perfection of ethical discipline, reject the perfection of tolerance, reject the perfection of perseverance, reject the perfection of meditative concentration, and reject the perfection of wisdom.

They reject the four applications of mindfulness, reject the four correct exertions, reject the four supports for miraculous ability, reject the five faculties, reject the five powers, reject the seven branches of enlightenment, and reject the noble eightfold path. They reject the four truths of the noble ones, reject the four meditative concentrations, reject the four immeasurable attitudes, reject the four formless absorptions, reject the eight liberations, reject the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, reject the emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness gateways to liberation, reject the five extrasensory powers, reject all the meditative stabilities, reject all the dhāraṇī gateways, reject the ten powers of the tathāgatas, reject the four fearlessnesses, reject the four kinds of exact knowledge, reject great loving kindness, reject great compassion, reject the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, reject knowledge of all the dharmas, reject the knowledge of the aspects of the path, and reject all-aspect omniscience. By rejecting all-aspect omniscience, they seize {{page:{number:4568,id:UT22084-014-001-97629,folio:F.324.a,volume:V19}}} an immeasurable, incalculable, boundless mass of demerit. Seizing an immeasurable, incalculable, boundless mass of demerit, they experience immeasurable, incalculable, boundless sufferings and unhappiness among beings in hell, animals, and pretas.”
{{milestone:{label:26.27,id:UT22084-014-001-93314}}}The venerable Subhūti then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed Lord, in how many ways{{note:{index:821,id:UT22084-014-001-93315}}} do those deluded persons who reject this profound perfection of wisdom reject it?”
“Subhūti,” replied the Blessed One, “those deluded persons reject the perfection of wisdom in four ways.”
{{milestone:{label:26.28,id:UT22084-014-001-93317}}}“What are the four ways?” asked Subhūti.
The Blessed One replied, “Those deluded persons who reject this profound perfection of wisdom are under the influence of Māra. As a result of that, the first cause, Subhūti, they reject this profound perfection of wisdom. They have no conviction, faith, or resolute belief with respect to profound attributes. As a result of that, the second cause, they reject this profound perfection of wisdom.
