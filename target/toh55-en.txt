The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
The Teaching on the Effulgence of Light
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Rājagṛha at Vulture Peak, together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks who had all attained great independence, eight hundred billion bodhisattva great beings with only one birth remaining and led by Maitreya, and four hundred billion bodhisattva great beings led by Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta.
Present in the retinue at that time was Candraprabhakumārabhūta. He had been seated in the assembly, but he now rose from his seat, arranged his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One. With his palms respectfully joined together, he asked, “Blessed One, which activities did the Thus-Gone One previously perform to achieve his definitive light, magnetizing light, motivating light, manifesting light, multicolored light, single-colored light, narrow light, vast light, pure light, utterly pure light, stainless light, utterly stainless light, immaculate light, gradually expanding light, bright light, utterly bright light, boundless light, utterly boundless light, immeasurable light, utterly immeasurable light, unfathomable light, utterly unfathomable light, swift light, utterly swift light, nonabiding light, groundless light, blazing light, illuminating light, inspiring light, light that leads to perfection, unimpeded light, unwavering light, straight light, light that dwells within the infinite, light displaying the marks of form, light displaying the various marks of form, light displaying the immeasurable marks of form, light displaying the characteristics of blue, yellow, red, and white colors, light displaying the characteristics of violet color, light displaying the characteristics of crystalline color, light displaying the characteristics of the sky’s color, and other such lights? Each of those various lights is manifested mixed with light rays of five colors, and each of those blue, yellow, red, and white lights are manifested mixed with an infinite number of multicolored light rays.”
The Blessed One replied to Candraprabhakumārabhūta in verse:
“I have achieved those various lights
Since I have abandoned delusion
Through the causes and conditions
Of inconceivable virtuous actions.
“Furthermore, I dwell on the path of the buddhas
Through a variety of practices,
And I manifest those mixed lights
Through the insight of emptiness and nonaction.
“Although external phenomena
Are empty and selfless,
Beyond actions and thoughts,
They appear with various particular characteristics. 
“The inner body is also
Empty, selfless, and beyond action,
And yet all kinds of sounds
Manifest from it.
“In the same way, I fulfill the wishes of beings
In accordance with their inclinations,

“When he first reached awakening,
The assembly that had gathered around him
And to whom he taught the Dharma
Counted eight hundred billion members.
“At that time, in the lands of the great Jambudvīpa,
There was a king called Devoted to Words.
He had five hundred sons who were handsome, 
Beautiful, and pleasant to behold.
“Their father, the king,
Was a majestic and powerful man
Who had sincere faith
In the Three Jewels. 
“Out of reverence, 
The king offered to that blessed one
All the most magnificent gardens
That were in his possession.
“All the walkways 
That crossed those gardens
Were lined with
Eight hundred million trees:
“Magnolia, banyan fig, 
Kiṁśuka, goolar fig,
Śiriṣa, aśoka, 
And other such trees.
“Those many trees blossomed during both summer and winter; 
Their branches, fruits, and flowers shone with brilliant colors.
The sweetest fragrances arose from them
And perfumed the body of the Thus-Gone One.
“All the monks had a golden color.
They were all sitting in front of those trees.
They had all attained retention
Through great exertion.
“At that time, out of sympathy
For the king, his sons, and the numerous assemblies,
The Thus-Gone One taught them
The sūtra on the definitive lights.
“When he heard that sūtra, 
The king, overwhelmed with joy,
Proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One 
In countless verses.
“That great king also offered the Blessed One
Eight hundred million magnificent bejeweled parasols,
Each of them decorated around its edge 
By garlands of wish-fulfilling gems.
“Every one of them had the value
Of eight hundred million coins made of pure gold from the Jambu River.
Each of those bejeweled parasols was adorned
With tassels made of eight hundred million wish-fulfilling gems.
“Shining with brilliant colors,
Those wish-fulfilling gems emitted light continuously,
So that there was no distinction 
Between day and night.
“Each of those light rays
Illuminated a hundred leagues,
And their light shone brilliantly, 
Eclipsing the sun and the moon.
“The four sides of the precious parasols were ornamented 
With lions and eight hundred million jewel tassels,
As well as eight hundred million garlands 
Made of precious golden threads.
“Those sublime bejeweled parasols 
Were also adorned 
With lattices of precious pearls
That intermingled in various ways.
“Those parasols completely covered the gardens,
And they were themselves surmounted by countless lotus parasols
Formed by various kinds of flowers
Such as jasmine, atimuktaka—also known as mucilinda—
“Udumbara, and blue lotus flowers.
All those parasols were beautified with precious lattices,
And cloths made of golden threads
That formed a covering canopy above. 
“Furthermore, eight hundred million bejeweled thrones
Built with sandalwood, supported by legs made of pure gold,
And decorated with eight hundred million
Cushions made of the finest silk were set forth.
“At that time, all types of sentient beings—
Up to those residing at the summit of existence—
Had gathered in that place to hear this discourse
From the Thus-Gone One.
“When they heard this discourse, 
Gods, nāgas, yakṣas, the kings of the gandharvas, 
Mahoragas, and asuras
Were overwhelmed with joy.
“They proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One 
In eight thousand verses,
And all of them made the aspiration
To reach great awakening.
“Filled with faith, the gods, the nāgas, 
The asuras, and all the other beings
Showered rains of mandārava flowers 
And precious pearls as offerings. 
“At that time, upon hearing this discourse, 
All the eight hundred million powerful and majestic great gods
Were also overcome with joy, and made the aspiration to reach great awakening,
‘In the future, may we also achieve such a light!’
“At that moment, the Thus-Gone One 
Knew their thoughts
And prophesied their awakening in these words:
‘In the future, you will accomplish buddhahood.’
“At that time, upon hearing this discourse that reveals the lights in full,
Śakra—lord of the gods—Brahmā, and the eight hundred million members of their retinues
Also became overwhelmed with joy, gave rise to the mind set on awakening,
And received this prophecy: ‘In the future, you will accomplish buddhahood.’
“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,
All the eight hundred million nāgas who had gathered there
Also gave rise to the mind set on awakening
And received a prophecy.
“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,
All the eight hundred million garuḍa kings who had gathered there
Observed the five vows
And also received that prophecy.
“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,

Played a hundred thousand musical instruments, making delightful sounds
As offerings to the Blessed One, and also received that prophecy.
“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,
All the hundred million yakṣa kings developed intense faith
In the pure wisdom of the Buddha,
And all of them also received the prophecy of their awakening.
“Candraprabha, you should know that, at that time,
You were the king Devoted to Words,
Who worshiped that blessed one with those various offerings;
Do not think that this was someone else.
“You have already heard that sūtra in the past,
And this is the reason why today, 
In this place, you once again 
Request to hear it.
“After I pass into nirvāṇa,
When the wheels of the sacred Dharma are about to cease,
Whoever develops faith in these Dharma teachings
Will be able to teach this discourse on a vast scale. 
“Those who teach this discourse in the future
Will be the guardians of my Dharma;
Like leaders guiding many travelers,
They will be known as guardians of the precious treasure.
“Know that those who hear this discourse in the future
And become interested for a mere moment will be blessed by the Buddha and Mañjuśrī;
They will behold many buddhas, who will entrust secret teachings to them,
And their insight will become sharp.

And offered those to the great guides.
“I sometimes worshiped the stūpas of thus-gone ones
With different types of offerings
Such as garlands of magnolias, jasmine, and aśoka flowers,
And banners and parasols.
“In the past, when I was circling in saṃsāra,
I practiced charity toward those who asked for favors;
I sometimes gave them flowers and fruits,
Sometimes bridges, wells, and springs,
“Sometimes elephants and vehicles,
Sometimes precious steeds and maidens,

And sometimes necklaces and garlands.

So that they showered rains in timely ways.
“Candraprabha, you should know that, in the pursuit of this discourse, 
I have undergone austerities for countless lifetimes;
Even if these were described for a hundred thousand eons,
This task would never come to an end.
“Abide by such a conviction and,
In the future, during the final period,
Give rise to genuine recollection
And expound this discourse!
“I clearly see the future
With my buddha eyes;
I know precisely all the various actions
That will occur.
“I also know all the monks who, 
In the pursuit of unsurpassed wisdom,
Will teach this discourse with minds filled with faith,
As well as all the directions in which this teaching will take place.
“I also know all the thoughts and methods of those who, 
In the future, during the final period,
Will be interested in this discourse
Upon hearing it.
“I know all the inferior beings 
Who will not hear this discourse
And who will therefore denigrate
The teachings of the Dharma.
“I will give a prophecy to all the monks and nuns
Who cry out of heartfelt longing
When they hear this discourse,
And they will behold the supreme victors. 
“Candraprabha, you should know that,
Through my awakened miraculous power,
I know the purity and the impurity of beings’ minds,
And even all their inclinations.
“I know all the qualities of sentient beings,
Such as those who are always dedicated to peace and isolation,
Dwell in absorptions without any attachment to saṃsāra,
And have permanently abandoned even its habitual patterns.
“I know which sentient beings will, in the future,
Adhere to untrue teachings,
And which ones 
Will be devoted to the Buddha. 
“Beings who are attached to worldly pleasures
Will not properly grow the seed of the buddhas’ awakening;
Due to such causes and conditions, 
Their practices will deteriorate.
“Candraprabha, those who realize the seed of awakening 
Are certain to obtain pure, boundless lights.
Thus, regard each of the causes and conditions related to such lights distinctly;
You should perceive them all through the power of insight.
“Those who abandon unwholesome friends,
Who rely on virtuous friends,
And who guard the purity of their discipline
Will accomplish the lights of the buddhas.
“Guard your senses, 
Abandon shamelessness and indecency,
Cultivate virtuous qualities,
And protect sentient beings!
“Stop being involved in conflicts,
Realize emptiness,
And develop erudition and eloquence
Without hankering for personal gain!
“Regard all personal achievements as being like fecal filth
And do not let the purity of your mind
Be defiled by the stains of selfish gains; 
Pursue liberation and you will achieve the unsurpassed goal!
“Accomplish the path of the buddhas,
Regard the Buddha and reality as being similar,
Always set ablaze the great torch of the Dharma,
And illuminate all the worlds!
“Let your mind be unshakable
Like the king of mountains,
And eagerly cultivate patience toward everyone,
Even when you are insulted or beaten!
“Act as a genuine virtuous friend
For the sake of sentient beings,
Abandon all forms of inferior attitude,
And always accomplish pure actions!
“Let your mind be stable,
Teach the unsurpassed Dharma,
And bestow this sacred discourse
On the kindhearted!
“Those who pursue unsurpassed wisdom
Are not afraid of saṃsāra;
Having abandoned negative deeds,
They will gain the most supreme benefits.
“As an analogy, Candraprabha, you should know 
That experts can skillfully handle fire, 
To produce various flavors without being burned,
While unskilled dilettantes burn their palms when handling fire.
“Moreover, the disturbed and crazed mind 
Of someone who has been poisoned
Can be cured by the heat of fire.
It is similar for the wise:
“Based on the mind, they see that the mind is empty.
Therefore, although they abide within saṃsāra,
They see—based on the eye—that the eye is empty,
And so they do not cling to the eye.
“Those who understand in that way
Can dwell on the eyes without causing affliction;
If they see that the eye is empty, they will achieve genuine wisdom,
And light rays will therefore manifest.
“If they see that the eye is empty, 
They will permanently abandon desire.
Due to this absence of desire,
Light rays will manifest.
“What is explained here with respect to desire also applies 
To all the other afflictions up to anger,
Ignorance, clinging to “I,” pretense,
Aggression, miserliness, envy, 
“Shamelessness, impatience, 
Haughtiness, arrogance, 
Pride, deceit,
Carelessness, dishonesty, and so forth.
“Those who obtain genuine wisdom
Realize the eye to be peace. 
Therefore, light rays will manifest
Through this realization.
“Those who have achieved genuine wisdom 
Are settled in the way of the buddhas,
And light rays will manifest
On this basis.
“Those who have achieved genuine wisdom 
Are settled in the methods of the buddhas,
And light rays will manifest
On this basis.
“I have never heard of or seen
Anyone who has permanently abandoned the obscurations
And accomplished the manifestation of light rays
Without achieving genuine wisdom.
“Those who, after realizing genuine wisdom,
Permanently rid themselves of the harm of the obscurations
And observe this conduct
Will achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who pursue the conduct of the victors 
And worship the thus-gone ones
After having trained in this discourse
Will achieve genuine wisdom and skillful means.
“Those who have achieved genuine wisdom
Should worship the buddhas
To perfect the emanation of light rays
Like fruits in the palms of their hands.
“For those who are deluded 
About the selflessness of the eye,
The qualities of spiritual training will decline;
Those persons will not achieve the emanation of light rays.
“It is those who realize 
The selflessness of the eye
Who accomplish the qualities of virtuous practice;
Such persons will achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
Will also realize the limit of the arising of the ear.
Realizing the limit of the arising of the ear
Is known as the quality of great virtuous practice.
“Those who do not understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also not understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Not achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who understand the ultimate essence of the eye
Will also understand the limit of the arising of the eye; 
Those persons will therefore
Achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who do not properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also not properly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Not achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also properly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who do not directly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also not directly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Not achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who directly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also directly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who do not properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also not fully understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Not achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state 
Will also directly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;
Those persons will therefore
Achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who do not properly understand the purity of the eye’s natural state 
Will not properly understand the purity of the ear’s natural state; 
Those persons will therefore
Not achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Those who properly understand the purity of the eye’s natural state 
Will properly realize the purity of the ear’s natural state; 
Those persons will therefore
Achieve the emanation of light rays.
“Know that this also applies
To the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes,
Textures, and mental phenomena.
“It also applies to the elements of earth, water, fire, and air, 
The world, suffering, 
The aggregates, elements, mundane sense sources,
Words, names, and so forth.” 
Then the Blessed One said to Candraprabhakumārabhūta, “Noble son, sentient beings dedicated to the Great Vehicle who wish to perfect this emanation of light rays must accomplish eighty types of accumulation of roots of virtue.

When he heard that teaching, Candraprabhakumārabhūta became overjoyed and spoke these verses of praise in the presence of the Blessed One:
“Since the Thus-Gone One knows 
The limit of the exhaustion of the eye, 
He displays pure wisdom
And is therefore endowed with pure and perfect lights.

The selflessness of the eye,

“Since the Blessed One 
Has benefited sentient beings in the past,

And he therefore benefits an infinity of worlds.
“Since the Thus-Gone One knows
The emptiness of the eye,
He has perfected all-comprehending wisdom,
And therefore displays the Thus-Gone One’s infinite lights.
“The Buddha knows the characteristics of the eye,
And those particularities are endless; 
Thus, since the names of wisdom are infinite,
The lights displayed by the Thus-Gone One are infinite.
“Since the Buddha knows 
The gateways of the particular words,
He realizes that the eye is empty and beyond words,
And he therefore displays infinite lights.
“Those who contemplate the selflessness of the eye
Will realize that the Buddha speaks the truth,
And they will therefore display the certainty
Of the Thus-Gone One’s lights.
“Since the Blessed One 
Has perfected the most sublime miraculous powers,
He understands the boundless disintegration of the eye,
And he therefore benefits all the worlds.

“The same applies to anger, ignorance, aggression,
Pretense, deceit, envy, pride, haughtiness, 
Generosity, discipline, patience, 
Diligence, concentration, and insight.”
Aware of Candraprabhakumārabhūta’s thoughts, the Blessed One smiled and emitted golden light rays that illuminated countless buddha realms and accomplished the benefit of beings within the worldly realms. Then those light rays circumambulated the Blessed One three times and vanished into the top of the Thus-Gone One’s head. 
At that moment, the bodhisattva Maitreya stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One. With his palms respectfully joined together, he praised the Blessed One and posed some questions with these verses:
“You roar like thunder and like a lion, 
Your voice resembles the song of the kalaviṅka bird,
And you beat the great Dharma drums.
Why do you smile?
“You shine more brightly than a thousand suns,
Your voice is immaculate,
And you possess the most amazing qualities.
Why did you emit light?
“You are adorned with generosity, discipline, patience, 
Diligence, concentration, and insight.
You have mastered all those perfections.
Why did you emit light?
“Thus-Gone One, your voice is soft,
You have permanently abandoned harsh words,
And you heal the diseases of sentient beings.
Why did you emit light?
“Great compassionate one, leader of human beings,
You realize that the eye is always empty and void,
And you teach the Dharma to sentient beings 
With your pure Brahmā voice.
“The same applies to the ear, the nose, the tongue, 
The body, the mind, words, names, and so forth, 
Up to the origin, cessation, 
The path, wisdom, and patience.
“Great compassionate one, leader of human beings,
You realize that the limits of the arising and exhaustion of the eye
And complete peace, as well as saṃsāra,
Are empty and void.
“The same applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures, 
Up to words and names. 
“You also teach that dependently arisen phenomena
Are beyond permanence and discontinuation, 
And that they are not produced by themselves or by others,
But that they originate from numerous conditions.
“At times, you describe the basis of suffering
Using various explanations.
At times, you praise the light of the buddhas
According to a variety of meanings.
“At times, you teach about the disengagement of phenomena 
Using countless words.
At times, you reveal the nonexistence 
Of a person, a life principle, a self, and a sentient being.
“Countless buddhas of the past
Have also taught this Dharma
Through hundreds of thousands
Of inconceivable verses. 
“The Thus-Gone One teaches 
About qualities, the Dharma, and the natural state,
But he is beyond expressions and things expressed.
Therefore, the Dharma that he expresses is also nonexistent.
“Blessed One, since you induce understanding in beings
By teaching the true Dharma,
The gods and yakṣas who hear your teachings
Will gain understanding.
“Likewise, all the asuras 
Will develop sincere interest,
And countless humans
Will cut through the web of doubt.
“They will realize the nature of desire,
Eradicate anger and ignorance,
And completely abandon 
The entire mass of suffering. 
“Suffering comes from the proliferation 
Of craving, pride,
Ignorance, deceit, and envy;
Ultimately, all those categories are pure.
“Since the Thus-Gone One clearly knows
The many terms related to every single Dharma teaching,
He delivers countless
Hundreds of thousands of teachings.
“Since he has properly trained in the Dharma
Under countless buddhas,
The words he expresses to teach 
Every single Dharma topic are endless.
“Since the Thus-Gone One knows
The many categories of phenomena,
He clearly understands the distinctions pertaining
To initial, intermediate, and concluding statements.
“Since he has learned
All the varieties of different words,
He clearly knows how to teach
The excellent, supreme meanings.
“Since such a completely pure voice
Originates from a collection of causes and conditions,
It does not depend on the tongue alone,
Or on the body and the mind alone.
“The earth has shaken in six ways,
And retinues have gathered from the ten directions.
When they gaze upon the Blessed One, their palms joined,
May their doubts be cleared away!
“The Thus-Gone One realizes 
That the limits of the exhaustion and arising of the eye
Are always intrinsically empty and void,
Beyond coming and going.
“He dwells within the very limit of reality,
Beyond abiding and fixation.
Blessed One, your eye is unimpeded,
So I ask you this today:
“Since the Thus-Gone One realizes
That the past and future limits of the eye, 
Its exhaustion and its non-exhaustion, as well as saṃsāra, 
Are intrinsically empty and void,
“He brings delight to worldly beings
By revealing the meanings of the Dharma. 
Why does the sage, who is endowed 
With that melodious voice, smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that the past and future limits,
As well as the eye, are empty and void,
And you are free from concepts and words.
Why do you smile? 
“Blessed One, you know that the eye is beyond measure,
And that the various verbal expressions
Are always empty and void by nature.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you clearly know that the limits of exhaustion and arising, 
As well as the eye itself, are empty and void,
And you have completely 
Abandoned all afflictions.
“You have obtained the wisdom 
Of the buddhas’ awakening,
And you have an excellent and supreme renown.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, since you have trained for a long time,
You teach the inconceivable.
You realize the emptiness of the eye,
And you are always stainless and immaculate.
“You know all the countless thoughts
Through a single realization.
As your light rays illuminate the worlds,
What do these omens portend?
“Great Sage, manifest Buddha, 
Exalted leader of human beings,
Since you have eliminated all afflictions,
Your mind is always peaceful and disengaged.
“Thus-Gone One, with your supreme wisdom 
You know the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.
Due to what causes and conditions
Do you smile today?
“The same applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
The six sense objects, and the four great elements,
Up to words and names.
“Blessed One, you realize that the eye is selfless,
That the ear is impermanent,
And that the nose is empty.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that the tongue is selfless,
That the body is impermanent,
And that the mind is empty.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that forms are selfless,
That sounds are impermanent,
And that scents are empty.
Why do you smile?

Why do you smile?

And that the aggregates are empty.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that the elements are selfless,
That the world is impermanent,
And that arising is empty.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that sounds are selfless,
That names are impermanent,
And that the path is empty.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that wisdom is selfless,
That disengagement is impermanent,
And that sentient beings are empty.
Why do you smile?
“Blessed One, you realize that any nature lacks inherent nature,
That the self is devoid of self,
And that inclinations are empty.
Why do you smile?
“You see that saṃsāra is selfless,
You know what is permanent and impermanent,
And you realize that nirvāṇa is empty.
Why do you smile?
“Thus-Gone One, your mind is free,
Your renown pervades the entirety of the three realms,
And you are worshiped by all beings, 
Such as Śakra, the rulers of human beings, and nāgas.
“The Thus-Gone One realizes
That the limits of the exhaustion 
And arising of the eye are void. 
Why does he smile?
“All the countless heirs of the buddhas
Have gathered in this retinue.
They were born from the Buddha’s speech
And emanated from the Dharma.
“They have come into the presence of the Blessed One
And respectfully join their palms.
For those who have gathered in this assembly,
I ask you to declare the causes and conditions of this light. 
“Since the Thus-Gone One realizes
That the eye is empty and selfless,
He truly surpasses
All householder practitioners. 
“The Thus-Gone One knows
The lack of difference and the sameness of phenomena.
Blessed One, you know this through your insight—
You do not perceive this through your miraculous powers.
“Blessed One, you realize that the eye is selfless,
That its essence is empty, and that it does not come from or go anywhere—
Your immaculate wisdom is immeasurable.
Why do you smile? 
“Thus-Gone One, your births are totally exhausted, 
And you protect all the worlds through your great compassion.
Dharma lord, supreme leader of human beings,
Please tell us why you smile!
“Countless great bodhisattvas
And hosts of majestic gods
Are holding sublime parasols in the sky,
And this great earth has shaken.
“You bring delight impartially to those 
Who have accomplished virtuous qualities 
For a long time under the thus-gone ones of the past.
Great compassionate leader, please tell us why you smile! 
“Those who have worshiped buddhas in the past
Are filled with joy when they hear this teaching.
Great guide, supreme leader of human beings, 
Please tell us why you smile!
“Blessed One, you please beings through your manifold teachings,
Your melodious voice resembles the songs of the swan—the king of birds—
And countless delightful words manifest spontaneously from your mouth.
Please tell us why you emitted light!
“The praises of your agreeable speech are proclaimed
In countless millions of verses,
And you are endowed with the supreme voice of the black Indian cuckoo.
Please tell us why you emitted light!
“The deep thunder roar by which you teach the Dharma
Resounds throughout countless hundreds of thousands of worlds.
Through your compassion you teach using both harsh and sweet words.
Why did you emit golden light?
“You understand arising, non-arising, exhaustion, and non-exhaustion,
And you realize that the eye is absent and beyond coming and going.
Illuminator of the world, supreme ambrosia,
Why did you emit golden light? 
“You realize that the occurrence of the eye
Is always empty and void, beyond coming and going, 
And groundless, like a mirage or a water bubble.
What are the causes and conditions of your smile?
“Know that the same applies
To the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, textures, and mental phenomena,
Up to words, names, and so forth. 
“Your body is permanent like vajra and indestructible. 
It is endowed with a hundred thousand perfect and supreme marks,
And you move your body without any fetters.
Please tell us—what are the causes and conditions of your smile?
“Your calves are round, your heels are broad,
And like a lion your abdomen does not bulge—
Your navel is deep, and your waist is broad.
Please tell us—what are the causes and conditions of your smile?
“Your golden body is pure, stainless, and immaculate,
And each hair on your body is deep black,
Perfumed, and curls to the right.
Please tell us—what are the causes and conditions of your smile?
“Your sublime body, perfect and permanently enduring,
Is like the king of trees, the banyan fig.
It is adorned with all qualities,
And your melodious voice pleases your retinues.
“Your shoulders are round, your upper arms are thick and beautiful,
Your crown protuberance is perfect and coiled clockwise,
You move throughout countless hundreds of thousands of realms,
And you point out to sentient beings the mistaken and the correct paths. 
“Your teeth are white and spotless like conch shells,
Your tongue is long and can cover your whole face,
Your cheeks resemble the jaws of a lion, and your nose is prominent.
All those qualities arise from your skill and your pure mind.
“The fragrance of blue lotus flowers exudes from your mouth,
And your body is pervaded by the scent of sandalwood.
Since you have cultivated love extensively in the past,

Radiate from your body.
Your pure mind is uninterrupted,
And you reveal countless discourses.
“Such qualities will not be accomplished
By those who uphold eternalist or nihilist views.
Only those who have abandoned extreme views
Will swiftly attain the pure body of the blessed ones.
“Your speech resounds like divine drums and roaring thunder;
It is melodious and clear like the songs of the kalandaka bird
And endowed with a hundred thousand tunes of divine songs.
Please tell us why you emitted lights!
“Great Guide, by teaching the Dharma through a single teaching, 
You interrupt the practices of those who adhere to improper discipline.
Whatever melodious words come from the Thus-Gone One’s mouth
Are profound and amazing!
“Leader of human beings, the light rays emitted from between your eyebrows
Illuminate a hundred thousand buddha realms,
Your sublime eyes have a deep black color,
And the mark of your crown protuberance cannot be seen by the celestial gods.
“Your forty teeth,
White like crystal,
Are the manifestation of your immeasurable virtuous activities.
Please tell us why you smile! 
“Thus-Gone One, your body of perfect qualities
Shines with countless excellent and magnificent colors
And emits the most amazing pure light rays.
Please tell us why you smile!
“Great compassionate one, supreme victor, leader of human beings,
You know the pure intentions of sentient beings,
And you have achieved supreme, unimpeded eloquence.
Please tell us why you smile!
“Since the Thus-Gone One has reached the other shore,
He is perfectly endowed with the three knowledges and the six higher perceptions,
And he displays innumerable pure light rays.
Please tell us why you smile!
“Blessed One, during countless eons in the past,
You worshiped a hundred thousand blessed ones,
And the fruition of such causes is inexhaustible.
Please tell us why you smile!
“Blessed One, since for countless eons in the past

You have realized the limits of the arising and exhaustion of the eye.
Please tell us why you smile!
“Great guide, you clearly know
The past, the future, and the present—
Your immaculate wisdom is unimpeded and inconceivable,
Please tell us why you smile!”
At that moment, in front of the numerous retinues, the Blessed One extended his golden hand, placed it on Candraprabhakumārabhūta’s head, and spoke these verses:
“Kumāra, listen carefully!
I now entrust to you
This teaching on awakening—
The sūtra on the manifestation of lights.
“In the future, during the final period
Of the degenerate times,
When the Dharma is about to vanish,
You must reveal it and expound it to sentient beings!
“With my buddha eye, I see and know
All those who, in the future, during the final period,
Will be interested in this excellent, profound, and sacred sūtra,
As well as all those who will not be interested in it.
“Sentient beings who pursue 
The path of awakening 
Should constantly recollect the Buddha
And keep this discourse in mind.
“Those whose faith has disappeared,
Who are attracted to distraction,
And who delight in sleeping both day and night
Will not be interested in this discourse. 
“Even if they become renunciants
Under my teachings,
Interest in the qualities of nirvāṇa
Will not arise in them.
“Those fools will squander the gifts of faith, 
And even if they hear repeatedly 
About the defects associated with conditioned phenomena,
They will cling to worldly concerns, and fear will not arise in them.
“Those fools
Will deprecate the wise ones,
And even if they wear the Dharma robes,
They will be devoid of even the slightest trace of insight.
“Since they will not know the true words
Well-spoken by the Sage,
And even if they hear them, they will not believe in them,
Do not stay in the company of such fools!
“Even if they hear these magnificent teachings,
Joy and devotion will not arise in their minds.
I reproach such individuals;
Though they have a human body, they waste it in meaningless pursuits.
“Those whose minds become filled with joy and devotion
When they hear these profound teachings
Have already met buddhas in the past.
There is thus no doubt that they will reach unsurpassed awakening.
“Fools who are inferior due to their unwholesome views
And sever the life force of insight will forsake awakening;
Therefore, abandon such nonvirtuous friends
And instead attend to the wise ones and revere them!
“All the innumerable defects in all the worlds,
And all sentient beings sinking in the three lower realms,
Originate from the causes and conditions of ignorance and delusion;
Therefore, those who follow their afflictions will not gain freedom.
“Since they forsake the true Dharma
And practice what is contrary to the Dharma,
You should abandon 
Those inferior, deluded beings!
“Like a charioteer breaking 
The axle of his steering wheels,
Sentient beings who engage in nonvirtuous actions
Will be reborn in the hell realms.
“Abusive words always come back to harm
Those who pronounce them, 
Just like a sharp axe that strikes the body 
Of the one who wields it.
“Karmic ripening is experienced without fail,
In accordance with the causes and conditions of the actions performed.
Those who do not understand this will attend to worldly sages,
Thinking they are virtuous friends.
“Then, thinking that those who meditate on emptiness
Realize the unconditioned, they will develop nihilist views;
They will say that the body becomes like a broken pot
And that the mind also ceases to be.
“They will mostly be drawn
To idle gossip,
And, strongly attached to it,
They will gain no benefits whatsoever.
“The harm caused by poisonous snakes
Will never cause many beings to fall into the lower realms,
But when a fool teaches the Dharma he destroys roots of virtue,
Which causes countless beings to fall into the hell realms.
“You who have gathered in this assembly should consider
That Candraprabhakumāra, who is present here today,
Has worshiped and venerated countless blessed buddhas in the past—
As many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
“Since he has pursued unsurpassed wisdom
By meditating in a steadfast manner,
His mind does not dwell
On any of the realms of existence.
“Since he knows that the limit of the arising of the eye
Is always pure,
He has abandoned concepts,
And he is utterly free from clinging.
“He will teach this unsurpassed sūtra
On the manifestation of lights
In order to benefit
Countless sentient beings. 
“Since fools are unable to train in this teaching,
They regard genuine spiritual practices as faulty.
Therefore, stay far away from such fools;
Do not assist them, and do not train in their teachings!
“Since fools are attracted to dispute,
They are unable to earnestly adopt behavior that is free from conflict.
Such beings are utterly devoid of an appropriate mindset,
So do not serve them or proclaim their praise! 
“Since fools are lazy and indolent by nature, 
They constantly engage in physical, verbal, and mental nonvirtuous actions;
They therefore completely lack
Pure discipline, insight, and erudition.
“They always think about the objects of their desires,
And they are drawn to distractions;
Regard the families, blood lines, 
And bodies of such fools as inferior!
“They are filled with aggression, they do not listen to advice,
And their faces are repulsive;
Even if they are born in virtuous locations,
Their bodies will be vile.
“Since they cling to the notion of self, they are deluded about the true meaning.
Since they lack intelligence, they are unable to understand the diversity of words.
Even if they hear teachings about intrinsic emptiness,
They are not interested in them.
“The thus-gone ones, the blessed ones
Have long ago abandoned all worldly verbal constructs.
Ordinary beings cling and are attached to those,
And so, for as long as they live, they fail to gain understanding and realization.
“Though they might proclaim the praises of discipline,
They do not practice pure conduct.
Though their mouths might teach the Dharma,
Their bodies engage in practices that are contrary to it.
“Though they might teach the Vinaya,
They always behave in ways that are contrary to it.
The Buddha has instructed his disciples
To wear the saffron-colored robes.
“Still, even if those who observe improper discipline
Put on such robes,
It only causes the strength of pride and carelessness
To grow in their minds.
“When they eat the food that is donated to them with faith, 
It is like swallowing burning iron.
In that way, after renouncing their households,
They do not experience sense pleasures,
“Nor do they gain the supreme happiness 
Associated with the Dharma of the buddhas.
In this way, they aspire for a variety of experiences
And do not abandon the two extremes.
“None of their interests are pure,
And even when such fools are in a large retinue,
They are like foxes
That have entered a pack of lions.
“Even if you give
Teachings related to peace,
They do not understand or realize
The meaning of suchness and emptiness. 
“Even if their teachings are praised in large retinues, 
This only causes their arrogance to increase;
Since they do not recollect the great teacher,
They lack modesty and humility.
“Even when they take hold of impure objects,
They joyfully hold on to them
As if they were wish-fulfilling gems,
And their minds never let go of them.
“Though such vile beings 
Might renounce their households,
Guard their behavior, put on Dharma robes, 
And carry alms bowls,
“These are all merely superficial displays,
And so they utterly lack true insight.
Even if they shave their facial hairs,
They do not renounce harmful attitudes.
“Since they follow teachings contrary to virtuous practice 
And fall into mistaken views,
The path leading to disengagement and nirvāṇa
Is completely ruined for them.
“They will not achieve the fruition
Resulting from engaging in virtuous practice,
And so their ignorance and other afflictions
Will not diminish in the slightest.
“While roaming in the cities, 
They sing the praise of disengagement.
Due to their lack of intelligence, 
Those fools do not understand the genuine path. 
“All their aspirations are nonvirtuous;
Even if they stay in the wilderness,
It is not to accomplish the true causes of nirvāṇa,
But out of desire for personal gain.
“Fond of drowsiness and sleep,
They are concerned about their physical well-being
And constantly long 
For ways to accomplish that goal.
“Even if they stay in the wilderness for many years,
They adhere to mistaken views,
And so they stray from the path leading to nirvāṇa,
Never obtaining the results of the paths of virtuous practice.
“Since they regress from the genuine view
And transgress pure discipline,
They always crave fine clothes to adorn their bodies,
And for the happiness of sensual pleasures.
“When they enter cities,
They bear the marks of pride 
And do not guard their physical actions,
And so they do not observe pure conduct.
“At times, when they enter cities and roam about,
They boast about their characteristics in these words: 
‘You should know that the caves in the wilderness are my home. 
My eyes downcast, I glance upward slowly, walking and stopping serenely.’
“Since they do indeed look like worthy ones,
All the householders say to one another,
‘This monk who stays in the wilderness
Is truly a noble being!’
“At other times, when visitors come to see them 
While they stay in the forest, they brag in words such as these:
‘In these jungles I wander day and night’
Or ‘This mat of fresh grass is where I sit.’
“At other times, when they go to cities and enter homes,
They eagerly ask with deception, ‘Are you well?’ 
Before engaging in frivolous mundane conversations
Related to various topics such as kings and thieves.
“At other times, driven by attachment,
They boast about their own qualities
In various ways
In the presence of women.
“They say, ‘I am a great field of merit for the entire world;
I have renounced my kingdom and become a renunciant,
And now I meditate on the path.
My queen and my children have been reborn in the higher realms.’
“Upon hearing those words,
The women are filled with immense respect;
They collect clothes, food, and beverages, which they offer with the words, 
‘Venerable, look upon us with compassion—please come to us directly!’
“Since such people are attached to delicious meals 
And do not know their defects,
They are at the mercy of Māra,
Like turtles caught in nets. 
“Even while staying in the wilderness,
They are conceited about their achievements,
And they continue to despise and deprecate
Those monks who are diligent.
“Since they repeatedly give rise to attachment
Out of the delusion related to gain and fame,
And since they constantly engage in deceitful actions to sustain themselves,
They repeatedly increase their physical and verbal unwholesome actions.
“Even if benefactors make offerings to them out of faith,
Their merit will decrease through the power of their laziness. 
Since those fools always long for nonvirtue,
They will never reach the acceptance that accords with emptiness.
“For those who completely abandon those faults
On the basis of my teachings
And practice with zeal and conscientiousness,
It will not be difficult to hear this teaching.
“For those who are unshaken by worldly concerns
Such as gain, loss, praise, criticism,
Suffering, and happiness,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
“For those who perceive the body as filth,
The aggregates as wounds,
And food as poison for the wounds,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
“For those who do not become haughty
But put on the attire of modesty
Even when they receive fine clothes,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching. 
“For those who are not conceited about their appearance and strength,
Who are not attached to food
But merely eat to sustain their lives,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
“For those who know that the objects of craving are empty
And therefore neither indulge in nor reject pleasures
But always act with the understanding of emptiness and disengagement,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
“For those living alone in the mountains—more than a league away—
Who, while absorbed in equipoise, 
Realize the selflessness of conditioned phenomena,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
“For those who accomplish the path of the pure eye
By realizing the characteristics of the limits 
Of the exhaustion, arising, and cognition of the eye, 
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
“The same also applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures, 
Up to words and names.
“You should know that,
In the future,
All the countless monks will be 
Either diligent or lazy in those ways.
“You should know that, in those ways, 
They will either be virtuous or nonvirtuous friends,
Accomplished or unaccomplished,
Trusting or untrusting.
“You should know that, in those ways, they will be
Either virtuous or nonvirtuous friends
Who accomplish or do not accomplish
The path of the eye’s exhaustion.
“You should know that, in those ways, 
Some will be strongly interested in awakening,
Only to lose interest later,
After one, two, or three months have passed.
“Still, even if the interest 
Born upon hearing this teaching 
Declines in some,
They will revive their faith later on.
“Some will not abandon their carelessness
When they hear this teaching;
Instead, they will think,
‘This discourse is not the Buddha’s words!’
“After hearing this teaching, 
Some will be caught by Māra;
Even if faith has initially arisen in them,
They will abandon it later on. 
“Those who are not interested in the Dharma will pursue falsehood, fame, and gain;
Although they might sing the praises of the lights 
Of dhāraṇīs, absorption, and complete comprehension 
As they roam through cities and towns, they will not gain true realization.
“Those who are bound by the five sense pleasures
And pursue worldly activities
Will involve themselves in concepts and statements,
And so denigrate the training in emptiness.
“Devoid of mindfulness and insight,
Their whole life will be wasted in meaningless pursuits;
The fools who abandon the Dharma of emptiness obstruct their discipline,
And so fall into the Hell of Unceasing Torment, never to be reborn in the higher realms.
“Someone who hears this discourse 
And memorizes a single four-line verse from it
Is more exalted than someone who builds
A thousand stūpas in every single moment.
“Someone who hears this discourse 
And memorizes a single four-line verse from it
Is more exalted than someone who offers
A hundred thousand flower garlands to the stūpas of the buddhas.
“Someone who contemplates this discourse
For just a single moment 
Is more exalted than someone who builds 
As many bejeweled stūpas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
“Someone who contemplates this discourse
For just a single moment 
Is more exalted than someone who venerates 
Ten million buddha realms by tossing flowers.
“Someone who contemplates this discourse
For just a single moment 
Is more exalted than someone who offers 
Ten million Dharma robes to the buddhas.
“The buddha eye is pure and superior—
There is nothing that it does not know and see.
Those who are dedicated to this discourse
Will achieve the buddha eye. 
“Countless eons ago, 
The Buddha Dīpaṅkara appeared.
I was at that time the child of a brahmin,
And I worshiped him by holding up flowers.
“He prophesied that I would become a buddha 
Named Śākyamuni,
And that I would teach this discourse
While sitting at the seat of awakening. 
“You were a young boy at that time.
When you heard this prophecy,
You became overjoyed and filled with faith. 
With your palms joined, you made this aspiration:
“ ‘When this brahmin child becomes a perfect buddha,
May I become his assistant.
After he passes into nirvāṇa,
May I uphold and guard his collection of teachings!’
“When the Buddha Dīpaṅkara
Taught this discourse on the manifestation of lights,
Both the brahmin son and the young boy
Listened to it carefully and kept it in mind.
“In the past, I once offered blue lotus flowers to that buddha.
You were present at that time, and you made the aspiration
To uphold this discourse during the final period of my teachings
And to propagate it on a vast scale.
“Those who, upon hearing this teaching,
Do not give rise to aversion but hold it,
Keep it in mind, read it, and recite it
Are sublime beings!
“In the future, you should uphold
This teaching that is difficult to hear,
Teach it extensively, and reveal its meaning
To sentient beings!
“In the past, 
When the true Dharma was about to disappear,
I also taught this discourse on the manifestation of lights 
Extensively to sentient beings.
“Because fools do not accomplish it with determination, 
They deprecate it.
Still, when I hear their words, 
I do not become angry.
“Instead, I always cultivate patience 
And benefit the world.
Since the strength of my patience is perfect, 
I am adorned with the major and minor marks.
“Kumāra, you should regard the excellent
And perfect body of the Buddha, 
As well as his pure and sublime golden color, 
As the outcome of the strength of his patience.
“Countless realms shake
When my feet touch the earth,
Yet no sentient being loses balance;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my patience.
“The hundred thousand light rays
Emitted from each pore of my hair
Illuminate all directions;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Creatures with frightening appearances such as rākṣasas,
As well as ravishing and majestic beings,
All show reverence to me;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“All the members of my retinues
Have developed gentle minds,
And they revere the Thus-Gone One;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“All the praises of the Buddha’s qualities 
Proclaimed within my great assemblies
With a hundred thousand musical tunes, 
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“A hundred thousand malevolent 
And frightening nāga kings
Become pleased when they see the Buddha;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Beings such as rākṣasas and yakṣas
Come to me carrying hundreds of thousands
Of flower garlands to worship me;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Thus-gone ones residing
In countless hundreds of thousands of realms
Are praising my qualities;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Hundreds of thousands of mahoragas 
And kaṭapūtanas gather together
And worship me by tossing flowers;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Sixty billion beings 
Including the yakṣa kings
Come to worship me;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“The kings of the nāgas 
Such as Manavaka
Also offer me red pearls;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Tumburu and a hundred thousand other devas of music
Gather together 
And worship me with music;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Hundreds of thousands of mahoragas
And kaṭapūtanas gather together
And worship me with offerings of flowers and perfumes;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“The nāga king Gandhāra
Reveals half of his body
And joins his palms respectfully toward me;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“A trillion beings
Such as Anaṅga and Rāhula
Worship me with minds filled with faith;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Kumāra, you should see
That whoever is touched by the Buddha’s light rays
Becomes freed from suffering and obtains happiness; 
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Samudra and a hundred thousand 
Gods of the wind fill the sky
And worship me by showering perfumed rains;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“A hundred thousand divine retinues 
Worship me by tossing divine flowers,
Abandon their cravings, and attend to the buddhas;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“You also advertise the Buddha’s miraculous power,
Generosity, and discipline,
Causing everyone to hear about them;
Regard this as the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Everyone gains understanding
Through the words related to the aggregates,
The elements, and the four truths;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
“Through my miraculous powers, 
The words related to the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
And utter peace, as well as the limit of its arising,
Are heard from the sky.
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘The eye arises from causes and conditions;
It does not come from or go anywhere.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘The buddhas are born from
The realization of the eye’s peace.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘Since the limit of the exhaustion of the eye is peace, 
The buddhas are born from this realization.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘Since the limit of the eye is utter peace, 
The buddhas are born from this realization.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘Since the limit of the arising of the eye is peace, 
The buddhas are born from this realization.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘Since the transformation of the eye is peace, 
The buddhas are born from this realization.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘Since the arising of the eye is peace,
The buddhas are born from this realization.’
“Through my miraculous powers,
These words will be heard from the sky:
‘Since the disengagement of the eye is peace, 
The buddhas are born from this realization.’
“The same applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, and textures, 
Up to words, names, and so forth.
“By extension, this explanation also applies
To desire, anger, ignorance,
Aggression, pretense, envy, deceit, 
Arrogance, pride, and so forth.”
When he heard this unique and extraordinary teaching, Candraprabhakumārabhūta was overjoyed. With his palms joined, he said, “Blessed One, if I were to invite the Thus-Gone One and his large retinue for lunch tomorrow, would he consider me with affection and consent to come for the lunch that I will prepare?”
As he said this, the Blessed One perceived Kumāra’s pure motivation, and he knew that this would benefit countless sentient beings. So, considering him with affection, he gave his consent by not responding. Candraprabhakumārabhūta then stood up, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and, filled with joy, went back to his home. Together with his retinue, and with the help of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, mahoragas, and other beings, he installed a silken marquee at a crossroads near the city of Rājagṛha. That marquee was very tall and wide, and it covered the whole area. It was decorated with symmetrical golden nets, garlands of precious gems, and lion standards, as well as a billion interwoven golden threads. Heaps of garlands of precious flowers in the most magnificent colors were spread on the floor, and innumerable garlands of other flowers, such as magnolia and rosewood flowers, were hung as ornaments, covering the entire interior of the precious marquee as well as the entire assembly. A throne and seats were arranged inside, and a variety of pure and delightful precious fragrant substances, such as pṛkkā, dumaca, sandalwood, and saffron, were burned. Different kinds of the most excellent mixed incenses were also prepared as offering substances. Fragrant water was sprinkled in all the lanes of the city, and fresh flowers were spread all over the ground. At that time, innumerable goddesses, female asuras, and daughters of Rāhula were thrilled and came with the desire to accomplish the cause of awakening, adorning that magnificent great city with their presence.
Once Candraprabhakumārabhūta knew that the entire city had been cleaned and decorated and it was time for the noon meal, he addressed the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please come to this city in order to heal sentient beings!”
The Blessed One arrived at the city with his many retinues, and as soon as he stepped through the city gate, the ground of that great city and countless billions of universes in the ten directions began to shake. At that moment, those who were blind could see, those who were suffering became happy, those who were deaf could hear, those who were ugly became handsome, those who were poor became wealthy, those who were childless had children, those who had no clothes received clothes, those who had no jewels received jewels, those who had no friends gained friends, and those who had no physical ornaments received all kinds of physical ornaments. Upon seeing the Thus-Gone One, many groups of birds such as swans, cranes, parrots, peacocks, and crows became overjoyed and started to sing the most pleasant and sublime songs, which brought immense delight to those who heard them. 
Miraculously, the Thus-Gone One also emanated countless magnolia trees, and many hundreds of thousands of sentient beings worshiped the Blessed One by proffering fresh flowers as well as the most fragrant perfumes and strewing them upon him. Many hundreds of thousands of mighty female asuras carried red pearls and sandalwood powders, which they joyfully tossed at the Thus-Gone One. Many asuras and gods were also present in the sky, sheltering the Thus-Gone One by holding bejeweled parasols adorned with gold and silver above his head. Through his miraculous powers, the Blessed One manifested countless hundreds of thousands of sandalwood trees, golden trees, and trees filled with jeweled vessels and cloths. Those trees were adorned with precious gems and with magnificent blooming flowers and leaves; they all manifested as the result of the collective karmic ripening of countless beings’ merit. Whenever the wind blew, the fragrance of their sublime perfumes pervaded innumerable buddha realms. Countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings also held up flowers at the same time and tossed them upon the Blessed One. Similarly, countless insentient manifestations were also emanated solely through the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous powers. Through his miraculous powers, all beings’ wishes were completely fulfilled in accordance with their individual aspirations. 
When the Blessed One arrived in the city, the entire assembly heard extraordinary and inconceivable words of instruction that rang out in the sky, no one knowing where the words came from. In this way, Dharma teachings were uttered in many hundreds of thousands of verses.
When the Blessed One entered the city, 
These words resounded in the sky:
“Those who realize the limit of the exhaustion of desire to be empty and void
Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”

These words resounded in the sky:

Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”
When the Blessed One entered the city,
These words resounded in the sky:
“Those who realize the complete cessation of desire to be empty and void
Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”
“The same also applies to anger, ignorance,
Aggression, pretense, miserliness,
Deceit, arrogance, pride, misery,
Suffering, origin, cessation, path,
“Sentient beings, boys, girls, women, men, living creatures,
The six faculties, the six objects, the four great elements,
The world, suffering, the aggregates, the elements,
Worldly arising, words, names, and so forth.”
Through those teachings of the Dharma lord,
All sentient beings were overjoyed,
And, upon hearing them, all the inhabitants of the divine worlds
Formed the wish to follow the vehicle of the Thus-Gone One.
When the Blessed One entered the city,
These words resounded in the sky:
“Since the Blessed One was so dedicated to the strength of generosity,
He reached awakening through the strength of generosity.”
When the Blessed One entered the city,
These words resounded in the sky:
“Since the Blessed One was so dedicated to pure discipline,

“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure patience,
He reached awakening through the strength of that patience.”

“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure concentration,
He reached awakening through the strength of that concentration.”
When the Blessed One entered the city,
These words resounded in the sky:
“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure insight,
He reached awakening through the strength of that insight.
“The same also applies to the strengths of miraculous powers, 
The higher perceptions, the qualities, the knowledge of past lives, 
Skill in means, retention, renown,
Faith in karma and in the branches of dependent origination, learning,
“Harmony with emptiness, peace, complete control, 
Expertise in the ultimate limit and voidness, fear, delight, altruism, 
Love, compassion, joy, equanimity, acceptance, harmlessness, 
The realization of emptiness, the absence of marks, and so forth.”
When the noble master endowed with the ten powers— 
The divine lord unmatched in terms of qualities and glory—
Came and walked in this sublime city,
He benefitted sentient beings extensively.
Since they had performed virtuous actions in the three realms in the past,
He caused the various virtues of the gods to increase.
All worldly beings revered him and listened to his teachings,
And everyone was filled with joy.
When the Blessed One came and walked in this sublime city,
The vast ground of the city started to shake.
When they saw the completely pure lights emitted by the Blessed One,
Everyone was amazed and thrilled.
Since the Blessed One came to that city and benefitted beings extensively,
The retinues of gods and humans were delighted,
And beings residing on the earth and in the sky praised him by saying,
“The Blessed One brings the highest happiness to the three realms!”
When the Blessed One placed the wheels of his feet on the ground,
Pure light illuminated the place, amazing everyone.
The delightful sounds of thoroughbred horses resounded in the city, 
And the birds flying in the sky were overjoyed.
Melodious tunes also manifested spontaneously
From the bracelets, anklets, necklaces, 
And various other precious ornaments
Of the many faithful maidens, without anyone playing the ornaments.
Everyone conversed joyfully and complimented one another 
With the most agreeable and auspicious words.
Those who were blind, deaf, or with other faculties impaired 
Recovered the full ability of their senses.
When the Thus-Gone One came to the city,
Gods and humans joyfully offered him flowers,
And melodious tunes resounded everywhere in the sky,
Bringing delight to countless groups of gods.
Beings with impaired memory had their derangements pacified, 
And they began to speak pleasantly to one another.
Pregnant women who were distressed and anxious 
Were comforted by the magnificence of those lights.
Undefiled Dharma teachings were expounded 
To the modest and humble men and women,
Causing all of them to joyfully give rise to a pure mindset 
And to prostrate to the feet of the supreme lord.
Some of them pursued the unsurpassed path of the blessed ones,
And some pursued the path of the bodhisattvas or the path of the hearers.
When the Blessed One came to the sublime city,
Everyone delighted in gazing at the face of the Blessed One.
Knowing the customs of that land through his wisdom,
The Blessed One benefitted them in accordance with the ways of the world.
He bestowed the supreme wealth of the Dharma on the bodhisattvas
And gave supreme riches to other sentient beings.
When the Blessed One came to the city,
These words resounded in the sky:
“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
Revere the Buddha.”
When the Blessed One came to the city,
These words resounded in the sky:
“Those who crave the limit of the arising of the eye
Revere the Buddha.
“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
Will develop fearless trust in the Buddha;
Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their faith will be uninterrupted.

Will achieve discipline free from clinging;
Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their faith will be uninterrupted.

Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will interrupt the stream of desire.

Will abandon anger that leads to the lower realms;
Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will interrupt the stream of anger.

They will interrupt the stream of ignorance.
“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
Will dwell within awakened wisdom;
Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
The flow of their awakened wisdom will be uninterrupted.
“The same teaching concerning the exhaustion of the eye
Also applies to all the gateways—the limit of the arising of the eye, 
Its limit, its cognition, its disengagement, its nonexistence,
Its unborn nature, its peace, and so forth.
“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye 
Will always be free of doubts
And will therefore achieve 
The Buddha’s miraculous powers.
“Those who crave the limit of the arising of the eye

Will always be free of doubts
And will therefore achieve 
The Buddha’s miraculous powers.
“Those who crave the quiescence of the eye 
Will always be free of doubts
And will therefore achieve 
The Buddha’s miraculous powers.
“The same also applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.
“Those who generate the boundless arising of the eye 
Generate boundless wisdom;
Since wisdom is boundless, 
So too is this Dharma teaching.
“Those who know the boundless exhaustion of the eye 
Will be unobscured with regard to the eye 
And will therefore achieve 
The unimpeded wisdom of the buddhas. 
“The same also applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.”
When the Blessed One came to the city,
A hundred thousand sentient beings
Heard those words of the Dharma manifested from the sky
And became free of doubts concerning the qualities of the Buddha.
Though desire arose in the minds of some of them, 
They were not scared by the Buddha’s wisdom.
Though desire arose in the minds of some of them, 
They did not turn away from the Buddha’s qualities.
Though desire arose in the minds of some of them, 
They pursued unsurpassed wisdom.
They accomplished the unique qualities 
And had no interest in the vehicle of the hearers.
Immature beings might practice concentration,
But since they are attracted to the bliss of concentration, 
They will develop manifest pride
And think that they have achieved the fruition of virtuous practice.
Immature beings might practice concentration,
But since they do not understand the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, 
They will never reach liberation,
Even if they practice for a hundred thousand eons.
They generate attachment 
To all forms of rebirth,
But if they were to understand the emptiness of birth itself,
Their vision would become completely pure.
Some might have accomplished the four concentrations,
But if they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their concentration will never be pure,

Lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of phenomena,
And since they have not understood the exhaustion of phenomena,
They will always experience defiled phenomena.
Even if they abide by ascetic practices,
If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion
They will not observe genuine ascetic practices.
Even if they wear the saffron-colored robes, 
If they lack the understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion
They will not wear the genuine Dharma robes.
Even if they are born within high-class families,
If they lack the understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion
They will not belong to pure families.
Even if they possess numerous retinues,
If they lack the understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will quickly fall into the lower realms,
And their retinues will be unable to protect them.
Even if they are experts in grammar,
If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion
They will not fully grasp the field of grammar.
Even if they are experts in the sciences of craftsmanship,
If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion
They will not be truly competent in crafts.
Even if they are experts in many types of inquiries
And can reveal the teachings through a single word, 
If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their explanations will not accord with the true meaning.
Even if they learn under scholars,
If they do not know what is secret and what is not,
And if they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will not comprehend this teaching.
Even if they clearly know a variety of verbal expressions, 
Worldly theories, and phenomena,
If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
It will be as if they have fallen into a thick creeping bush.
Even if they are experts in grammar who teach the signs of virtue and nonvirtue
And have mastered letters, words, language, reading, and recitation,
If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will lack an understanding of those topics.
Even if they are experts in female anatomy, in skillful words of seduction,
Pleasing and soothing their body, and applying various treatments,
If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will lack any real understanding of those skills.
Even if they can teach hundreds of scriptural traditions
Without forgetting a single letter,
If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their explanations will be meaningless.
Know that the same applies 
To the limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, and its cognition,
Up to its utter peace.
The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.
Even if they read and recite grammar
While understanding its meaning,
If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their knowledge will always be inferior.
Even if they recite the basis of authoritative speech
And understand secret mantras,
If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Their knowledge will always be inferior.

To the limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, and its cognition,
Up to its utter peace. 
The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names. 
When the Blessed One came to the city,
Countless sentient beings
Heard those Dharma words manifested from the sky
And gained an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.
When the Blessed One came to the city, countless sentient beings
Heard those Dharma words manifested from the sky
And realized the intrinsic nature of the eye.
Realizing emptiness and selflessness, they all achieved the pure eye.
The same should be applied to everything
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.
Know that the same also applies 
To desire, ignorance, aggression, 
Pride, arrogance, and deceit,
Up to carelessness. 
When the Blessed One came to the city,
Countless sentient beings
Heard from the sky
The various names of the Buddha.
Some heard the name 
Unequaled One Who Scares Away Desire.
Some heard the name 
Benefactor of the World Who Scares Away Anger.
Some heard the name 
Tamer of Pride Who Realizes the Nature of Ignorance.
Some heard the name

Some heard the name 
Revealer of Liberation through the Excellent Dharma Scriptures.
Some heard the name 
Liberator of Sentient Beings’ Suffering on a Vast Scale.
Some heard the name 
Leader of Human Beings Who Liberates the World.
Upon hearing those names, everyone achieved the pure eye.
Everything can be measured—including the vastness of the sky, 
The depths of the ocean, and the size of Mount Sumeru—
But the wisdom of the Buddha cannot be fathomed.
For those who have gained certainty about the exhaustion of the eye,
It will not be difficult to achieve the Dharma body, 
And those who have achieved the supreme Dharma body
Will attain the boundless, all-apprehending wisdom.
Those who attain the boundless, all-apprehending wisdom
Will understand the boundless discourses,
And for those who understand the boundless discourses,
It will not be difficult to achieve the Buddha’s miraculous powers.

The same should be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, textures, and mental phenomena,
Up to words and names.
At that moment, the great earth with its ocean and mountains started to shake,
And all the many asuras and gods became euphoric.
Everyone aspired to defeat the deceitful Māra and his armies,
And to achieve the state of buddhahood.
Residing in their respective palaces,
The gods joyfully exclaimed to one another,
“Today, the Great Guide has appeared in the world
And benefitted all the gods and humans!”
From their palaces, the retinues of gods residing above the earth
Exclaimed joyfully, filled with faith,
“Today, the Great Guide has appeared in the world; this is excellent!
He has brought happiness to all the world!”
When they heard this, all the gods residing in the sky
Were delighted, and intense faith arose in their minds.

And liberate all sentient beings!”

Boundless practices for ten million eons,

And said, “The Great Guide has come and benefitted the world!
“Since the Thus-Gone One has transcended birth and death,
He has defeated many demons and non-Buddhists;
He has perfected unsurpassed awakening
And guided many beings to the other shore!”
When they heard this, all the gods of the Brahmā realms
Were delighted, and intense faith arose in their minds.
With magnificent melodious voices, they praised Buddha
And said, “The Great Guide has come and benefitted the world!”
When they heard those words passing from one group to another,
The gods of the Heaven of Brahmā’s Retinue joyfully exclaimed,
“The Great Guide has come and benefitted the worlds!
He scares away and frightens the armies of Māra!” 
Everyone up to the gods of the Peak of Existence heard those words: 
“The Buddha has come and benefitted the world!”
As those words resounded everywhere,
The asuras decreased and the gods increased in number.
The houses of the demons became empty,
While the retinues of gods multiplied.
Through the power of fearlessness, all beings overcame their wrong views
And swiftly reached supreme awakening.
The very moment the gods heard those words,
“The Blessed One has come and benefitted the world,”
They exclaimed, “The Guide of the World is excellent!
He bestows the pure eye on sentient beings!”

And accomplished the gateway of thorough comprehension.
When they heard those words manifested from the sky,
They worshiped the Buddha with offerings of flowers,
Accomplished exalted qualities,
And displayed the miraculous power of great compassion. 
When they heard those words manifested from the sky,
They proclaimed the most magnificent praises
Of the Blessed One’s body, his birthplace,
His family lineage, and the sound of his speech.
He gave teachings through a variety of miraculous powers,
In accordance with the different sentient beings;
He gave eminent teachings related to the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body,
Forms, sounds, and so forth, as well as the contraction and stretching of the limbs.
Since the Blessed One has transcended the world,
He acts as a torch within the worlds
And manifests many forms;
All these are the Buddha’s miraculous powers.
He gave different teachings
To those who were suitable vessels and those who were not:
To those who had never worshiped the buddhas in countless lifetimes,
And to the unruly ones who were hard to tame, he taught about the hell realms.
For those who were deluded about karmic deeds
And indulged in concepts while relying on views, 
The Blessed One manifested the words related to
The pacification of views and concepts.
The words related to the essential nature,
Definitive emptiness, the absence of coming and going,
The absence of marks, and complete nonexistence 
Were also heard from the sky.
A hundred thousand sentient beings
Also heard from the sky the words of instruction 
Related to the eye of flesh and the eye of insight,
Up to the Dharma eye.
Through the Blessed One’s miraculous powers,
The words of instruction related to discipline,
Absorption, insight, liberation, and liberated vision
Were also heard.
Through the manifestation of miraculous displays,
He taught the genuine Dharma 
To all sentient beings
Using the appropriate words.
For those beings who were inspired by
The practices of generosity, discipline, and patience,
He miraculously manifested the words of generosity, discipline, and patience,
In accordance with their inclinations.
Through the Blessed One’s miraculous powers,
He taught accurately and in great detail,
In accordance with sentient beings’ faculties,
And caused them to adopt the teaching, retain it, and teach it.

Concerning the aggregates, elements, and sense sources, 
And related to the characteristics of the particular contexts of the bodhisattva levels.

And the infinite light rays of wisdom,
As well as teachings related to the abandonment and nonabandonment
Of the afflictions and their latent patterns.
Through the Blessed One’s miraculous powers,
They also heard teachings related to the nature of gods and humans,
And to the various types of rebirth 
Caused by different actions and their results.
At times, he emanated women with ornamented bodies 
In front of the women present,
And words of instruction related to weariness then resounded in the sky,
Eliminating the desires of all those who heard them.
Through his compassion, he taught the unsurpassed Dharma
To those who—like Śāriputra—
Had developed intense faith,
In accordance with their inclinations.
The hearers—Maudgalyāyana, Kāśyapa, 
Kaphina, Ānanda, Mahākāśyapa, 
Ājñātakauṇḍinya, and others—
Heard Dharma teachings that accorded with their inclinations.
The many gods, asuras, and yakṣas,
Virūḍhaka with his retinue, and the countless kumbhāṇḍas 
Heard the words of this dhāraṇī mantra
Through the Blessed One’s miraculous powers:
Idisi vidisi irasu ira aunasi manasi ukhyi anokhyi akhicalamangnaṃye darniṣṭhanimi takani emimantra nihara apure buddhe nire akhichara viyakiriyate akhichara­paramite kalāvahini sarvobiṅ-śiniradhevauna paraśasdate śasta paraśasdata tarasdata bhūmi āmabhara lilabhana śicacidata vivamati cidata-ananta oberahavamita­bhūmi nanamkāni akanivibhimidate śariviṣṭha amalanimalā pūlitena raśi ca hahari mamalī bharani tiṣṭha cakṣunirahara udharitapaci antari kutari ketu suketu suparani karani kusumaniyai kakari kakhari upalamūri tiṣṭha ṅarani nāganirahare paraldate ateparayate anatarabhandhe anataratabhatiśi ca hasiri makhali īnisambhare tiṣṭha sittarani kubhulocate.
Vaiśravaṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, 
And the other guardian kings
Recited the syllables of this mantra of truth 
With countless magnificent tunes.
Those limitless tunes manifested 
Through the Blessed One’s miraculous powers.
Since those miraculous powers were endless, 
The teachings, too, were endless.
At times, through the power of those miraculous displays,
The bodies of buddhas turning the Dharma wheel—
Just as the one seen today—
Were manifested in realms devoid of a buddha.
In an inconceivable number of realms,
He displayed countless emanations of himself
That walked seven steps right after being born,
Gave up their kingdoms, renounced the world,
Reached buddhahood on the seat of awakening,
Contemplated the Dharma they had realized,
And turned the Dharma wheel
Before passing into nirvāṇa.
By teaching the Dharma in various ways
Through such miraculous powers,
He caused countless sentient beings
To achieve exalted wisdom.

Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.

The same applies to the pride related to 
Realization, miraculous powers, concentration, and erudition,
To wealth, oration, family, retinues,
Music, singing, eloquence, fame, excellence, praise,
Veneration, acquisition, beauty, deceit, 
Frivolousness, lack of modesty,

As well as that related to carelessness and desire.

Furthermore, he manifested perfumed chambers, 
Flowers, palaces,
And sublime storied mansions,
In addition to emanated buddhas who resided in them.
He also manifested divine maidens 
Residing in mansions made of magnolia flowers;
The upper halves of their bodies were visible,
And they worshiped him by holding up garlands of flowers.
He also manifested asura maidens
Residing in mansions made of jasmine flowers;
The upper halves of their bodies were visible,
And they worshiped him by holding up garlands of flowers.
He also manifested gods
Residing in mansions made of blue lotuses;
The upper halves of their bodies were visible,
And they praised the Buddha’s qualities. 
He also manifested gods of the Brahmā realms 
Residing in palaces made of gold;
Their entire bodies were visible,
And they praised the Buddha with their melodious voices. 
There were also goddesses whose bodies
Were adorned with various ornaments,
And these beautiful words manifested
As their ornaments touched one another:
“Though all conditioned phenomena
Are unstable and changing,
Immature beings, due to their mistaken conceptions,
Do not understand this reality as it is.”
The words that manifested from those ornaments
Came from neither the goddesses’ bodies nor their minds;
They did not come from or go anywhere— 
They were beyond directions.
The same should be applied to everything 
Up to forms and the mind.
Still, due to their ignorance, 
Immature beings will entertain doubts about this.
Since the beautiful words
Manifesting from those various ornaments
Resounded in all the buddha realms,
Countless sentient beings were liberated.
Therefore, you should regard as pure
The Guide’s body and mind—
His self-manifest wisdom
And his body endowed with boundless qualities.
He has transcended craving’s proliferation,
He is disengaged and faultless,
His mind is purified and free from views,
And he is adorned with the major and minor marks.
You see how when the Blessed One
Came to the city,
He walked like a lion,
He moved like a swan and like an elephant,
He fulfilled the wishes of all sentient beings,
He had perfected the most exalted form of merit,
He was adorned with the authentic marks,
And all beings gazed at him insatiably.
You see how since the supreme leader of human beings
Was endowed with great compassion,
The smallest gift offered to him 
Caused one to gain immeasurable benefits;
For many hundreds of thousands of eons,
Until the attainment of nirvāṇa, 
The karmic ripening of those many sentient beings
Was therefore uninterrupted.
You see how the perfect leader of human beings
Had perfected undefiled discipline,
Causing many sentient beings 
To respectfully prostrate to him,
And how numerous divine retinues
Abandoned their palaces
And attended to the Guide,
Without any attachment to playful activities. 
You see how Māra and his hordes 
Developed faith in the Blessed One,
Brought forth golden fans,
And arranged them around him.
Five hundred māras
Tossed magnificent divine flowers
Onto the Thus-Gone One
And pursued unsurpassed wisdom.
Since they had praised and worshiped
Buddhas in the past,
Each of them now became delighted
Upon meeting the Blessed One;
They proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One
With countless eloquent words.
At that time, those māras
Were said to have abandoned cyclic existence.
As soon as they proclaimed the praises of the Blessed One,
They understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
And the limit of the arising of the eye,
Up to the characteristics of its utter peace.
Since they had realized the boundless meanings of the eye—
The eye’s exhaustion and so forth—
They taught them to sentient beings
With skillful words.
Since they did not cling to names and meanings
And had no doubts about them,
They realized that they do not come from or go anywhere,
And that they are beyond adoption and rejection.
Since the nature of words is empty and void,
They realized that words are beyond 
Abandonment, adoption, retention,
Reading, recitation, and accomplishment. 
This has also been revealed
By the thus-gone ones of the past;
Since they are mere imputations,
They are ultimately inexpressible.
Such intrinsically empty phenomena
Transcend the aggregates, the elements, and the sense sources;
They are neither false nor true, but groundless and unsupported; 
They eliminate verbal expressions and bring thoughts to utter peace.
Since immature beings are attached to the marks of beings,
They see the Blessed One coming to the city;
Although the Blessed One is completely beyond marks,
Those immature beings entertain mistaken thoughts.
Those who become delighted
When the Blessed One comes to the city
Conceive of marks
And will be tormented.
Those who have transcended conceptual marks
Will not see him coming to the city;
They will reach the insight that is free
From all concepts related to the marks of going and moving. 
Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks
See him coming to the city;
They generate concepts
Related to birth and saṃsāric phenomena.
Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks
And become delighted
Are dwelling within Māra’s domain; 
Those are the manifestations of Māra’s domain.
Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks
See him as changing;
Since they are tormented,
They are the objects of a wise person’s pity.
Those who view the Dharma as something to be attained
Must also worry that the Dharma will be lost.
Those who perceive the Buddha as taking birth
Experience the suffering of nirvāṇa.
Those who have understood all marks
By training for many eons
Do not conceive of the Buddha coming to the city,
And they do not entertain the notion of nirvāṇa.
Those who realize that the characteristics of the mind are empty
Are dwelling within the domain of the buddhas;
They do not conceive of the Buddha coming to the city,
And they do not entertain the notion of nirvāṇa.
Those who clearly understand in that way
Will behold the buddhas
But realize that their essence is empty;
In the end, they completely transcend birth and cessation.
After practicing austerities for countless eons, the Blessed One 
Has realized the empty essence, but immature beings do not understand this.
When the Blessed One came to the city, 
He was surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of retinues.
Compared to the merit created by humans and nonhumans
Who make offerings with minds filled with faith,
The merit created by someone who, for a single instant, 
Contemplates the limit of the exhaustion of the eye 
And realizes the emptiness of its marks 
Is more exalted;
No number, fraction, or illustration 
Comes close to that merit. 
Know that the same applies
To the limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, and its cognition,
Up to its utter peace.
The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.
At that time, when the Blessed One
Came to the city, 
The earth started to shake
By the mere fact of his feet touching the ground.
All the mountains
Bowed toward the Blessed One,
And all the gods and humans came to listen to the Dharma
And worshiped him with reverence.
At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city, 
The lords of the gods, the kings of the humans,
Many asuras, and many yakṣas left their cities,
Gathered in front of the Blessed One, and joyfully worshiped him.
At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,
All the countless types of birds—
Parrots, peacocks, and kalaviṅka birds—
Started to play joyfully in the sky.
When they saw the supreme qualities 
Of the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One,
They all started to sing 
Various melodious tunes.
When the Blessed One came to the city,
Through his miraculous powers
All those—among the countless hundreds of thousands of beings present— 
Who were blind regained sight, 
All those who were deaf could hear,
All those with impaired faculties 
Recovered the full functioning of their faculties, 
And all those who were suffering became happy. 
At that time, when the Blessed One 
Came to the city,
These words resounded
In the sky:
“Those who conceive of the Thus-Gone One
In terms of marks cannot be said to worship the Blessed One,
And they do not realize 
The nature of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.
“Those who abandon marks gather the basis of all qualities,
And so they realize the nature of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.
Since they will realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, 
They will also comprehend the buddhas’ qualities. 
“With no grasping and obscuration regarding the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
With no maintaining and dwelling on the limit of the arising of the eye,
And free of thinking regarding the disengagement of the eye,
One truly sees the thus-gone ones.
“Those who are free of thoughts regarding the limit of the arising of the eye,
Who are free of mental concepts regarding the limit of the eye,
And who do not express anything regarding the eye’s disintegration 
Truly see the thus-gone ones.
“Those who are free of attachment regarding the nonexistence of the eye,
Free of grasping regarding the eye’s unborn nature,
And free of clinging regarding the eye’s utter peace
Truly see the thus-gone ones.
“Since they understand the eye’s exhaustion, they actualize the marks.
Since they understand the limit of the eye, they ascertain the faculties. 
Since they understand the eye’s arising, they reach mastery over their faculties.
Those beings truly see the thus-gone ones.
“Having realized the nonexistence of the eye, they comprehend forms.
Having realized the eye’s disintegration, they discern phenomena.
Having realized the eye’s unborn nature, they accomplish the path.
Those beings truly see the thus-gone ones.
“Since they genuinely realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They also understand the different types of actions,
And since they understand the different types of actions,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Since they genuinely realize the limit of the arising of the eye,
They also understand the different types of suffering,
And since they understand the different types of suffering, 
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Since they genuinely realize the eye’s disintegration,
They also realize the disintegration of suffering,
And since they realize the disintegration of suffering,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Since they genuinely realize the nonexistence of the eye, 
They also realize the abandonment of characteristics,
And since they realize the abandonment of characteristics,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Since they genuinely realize the unborn nature of the eye,
They also realize the abandonment of latent patterns,
And since they realize the abandonment of latent patterns,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize the nonconceptual nature of the eye,
They also realize the abandonment of obscurations,
And since they realize the abandonment of obscurations,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize that the eye is beyond words, 
They also realize the strength of awakened wisdom,
And since they realize the strength of awakened wisdom,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize that the eye does not come from anywhere,
They also realize the abandonment of desires,
And since they realize the abandonment of desires,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize the practice of concentration, 
They also realize the abandonment of afflictions,
And since they realize the abandonment of afflictions,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
“Similarly, those persons also perfect
The knowledge of the eye’s past limit, 
The knowledge of the eye’s lack of abiding,
The knowledge of the eye’s arising,
“The knowledge of the Buddha’s miraculous powers,
The knowledge of the eye’s inferior character, 
The knowledge of the eye’s exalted character,
The knowledge of lower wisdom, 
“The knowledge of pure wisdom,
The knowledge of pure discipline, 
The knowledge of the physical precepts,
The knowledge of pure sound,

“The knowledge of the source of suffering,
The knowledge of undefiled discipline, 
The knowledge of the causes and conditions of discipline,
The knowledge of the causes and conditions of suffering, 
“The knowledge of the causes of suffering’s exhaustion,
The knowledge of conditioned phenomena, 
And the knowledge of the exhaustion of defilements—
They perfect all these knowledges.
“Furthermore, they genuinely achieve
Knowledge of the twelve causes and conditions—
Both the knowledge that involves engagement 
And the knowledge that does not involve engagement—
“And, likewise, knowledge of marks and the absence of marks,
Knowledge of the conditioned and the unconditioned, 
Knowledge of classifications and summaries,
And knowledge of the minds of oneself and others.
“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize
The limit of the exhaustion of the eye, the limit of its arising,
Its limit, its disengagement, its cognition, its nonexistence, 
Its unborn nature, and its peace, 
“They cause many sentient beings
To achieve pure wisdom, 
Powerful wisdom,
And diligent wisdom.
“Furthermore, they genuinely achieve 
The knowledge of sameness and difference, 
And the knowledge of the inclinations 
Of all sentient beings.
“They also genuinely achieve 
The knowledge of the superior inclinations 
Of all sentient beings, as well as
The knowledge of the purity of their minds,
“The knowledge of actions and karmic ripening,
The knowledge of the sense faculties and the elements,
The knowledge of mental transformations, the knowledge of insight and dedication,
The knowledge of complete liberation, and the knowledge of supreme eloquence.
“Furthermore, since they genuinely understand 
Those sentient beings who are malicious
And show no interest in the Dharma,
They are able to inspire them.
“Since they genuinely realize
The ways things are,
They also achieve the knowledge devoid of laziness
As well as the knowledge of time.
“Through their miraculous powers, 
They also genuinely realize
The knowledge that discriminates phenomena
From the unimpeded wisdom.
“They also genuinely achieve
The knowledge of the vast meaning,
And knowledge associated
With verbal teachings.
“They also genuinely achieve
The knowledge concerning good companions and conducive places,
As well as the knowledge concerning moderation
Related to clothing, food, and beverages.
“They also genuinely achieve 
Knowledge of the determined accomplishment
Of the dhāraṇī qualities
Related to nonaction.
“Likewise, devoid of physical and mental faults,
And having abandoned exaggeration and denigration,
They also genuinely achieve
The unsurpassed wisdom they pursue.
“Furthermore, through their miraculous powers, 
They manifest emanated bodies in the sky.
They thereby ripen hundreds of thousands of beings, 
Bringing everyone great joy with their knowledge of engendering faith.
“They also have the knowledge of trusting and respecting the thus-gone ones,
As well as the knowledge related to inspired accomplishment 
Of the Dharma that leads to the abandonment of desire,
And the knowledge of inspired worship of the noble Saṅgha.
“Likewise, they have the knowledge of devoted dedication to great awakening,
The knowledge related to the devoted revelation of the dhāraṇī gateways,
The knowledge that discerns the different inclinations,
The knowledge that realizes the noble absorptions,
“The knowledge that induces certainty 
About that which is to be guarded and recollected,
The knowledge that penetrates boundless minds,
The knowledge related to teaching in countless verses,
“The knowledge of understanding and realizing the connection of desire,
The knowledge that prevents one from falling into inferior destinies,
The knowledge that causes one to abandon nonvirtuous friends,
The knowledge that causes one to attend to virtuous friends,
“The knowledge that analyzes questions and answers,
The knowledge that realizes what is possible and what is not,
The knowledge that realizes what is the subject and what is not,
The knowledge that distinguishes what is superior, intermediate, and inferior,
“The knowledge of the conditioned and the unconditioned,
The knowledge of what is material and substantial and what is not,
The knowledge of what is abridged and what is not,
The knowledge of accomplishment and non-accomplishment,
“The knowledge of the eye and the non-eye,
The knowledge of what is simultaneously present with the eye,
The knowledge of the particularities of the eye,
And the knowledge of the nature of the eye.
“The same should be applied 
To all the twenty-five phenomena—
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body 
Up to words and names.
“Those who contemplate the fact
That the causes and conditions of the eye
Are ultimately empty, void, and devoid of self
Will, accordingly, perfect genuine mental absorption without a doubt.
“The persons who realize with certainty and contemplate 
The eye’s dependent origination and impermanent character 
Will, accordingly, genuinely realize
That the causes and conditions of the eye are ultimately nonexistent.
“The same should be applied 
To all the twenty-five phenomena— 
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body
Up to words and names.”
Here, I have summarized the amazing displays that were manifested,
By the mere fact of his feet touching the ground,
When the Blessed One came to the city.
To please beings, I will now teach a bit about his qualities.
At that moment, countless hundreds of thousands of light rays
Radiated from each pore of the guide of gods and humans.
Each of those light rays illuminated countless realms
And performed awakened activity for the sake of numerous beings.
If those who have worshiped buddhas in the past
And practiced generosity and discipline for a long time
Hear about the miraculous displays that were described, 
They will be overjoyed and filled with devotion.
If those persons who know that the Buddha’s miraculous powers
Are not the domain of the hearers and the solitary buddhas
Hear about the miraculous displays that were described, 
They will be filled with devotion and amazement.
Since the guide of gods and humans manifested
Such a variety of miraculous displays through his inconceivable powers,
Countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings
Attended to, revered, and worshiped the Thus-Gone One.
Since the leader of gods and humans expounded 
Countless hundreds of thousands of discourses through his inconceivable powers,
Many sentient beings, upon hearing them, 
Faithfully adopted all those teachings and were overjoyed.
At that time, 
When the Blessed One came to the city,
These words resounded in the sky 
Through the strength of his miraculous powers:
“By knowing the limit of the exhaustion of the eye 
Up to its peace and its causes,
Everything is beyond coming and going—
Ultimately empty and void.
“The same should be applied 
To all the twenty-five phenomena—
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body
Up to words and names.”
At that time, 
When the Blessed One came to the city,
The most sublime melodious voice
Manifested in the sky,
Proclaiming the praises 
Of the Thus-Gone One’s various names,
Thereby generating faith and devotion 
In the minds of all the members of those great assemblies:

“The same should be applied to all the twenty-five phenomena— 
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body
Up to words and names,
As well as to flower garlands, perfumes, lamps, parasols, and fabrics.” 
At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,
Through his inconceivable miraculous powers,
The most sublime melodious voice
Manifested in the sky.
As it revealed the various 
Activities of the dhāraṇīs,
The great assemblies present
Heard these words:
“These dhāraṇīs cause one to realize all the ultimate modes of phenomena—
From the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, the limit of its arising,
Its limit, its disengagement, and its cognition, up to its peace.
They cause one to realize that, ultimately, everything is pure—
“That which is gathered through the power of generosity, 
That which is accomplished through the power of discipline, 
That which is established through the power of patience,
That which is generated through the power of diligence,
“That which is cultivated through the power of concentration,
And that which is revealed through the power of insight,
As well as the abandonment of words, expressions,
And language, up to forms and mind.
“They cause one to realize that everything defiled and undefiled, 
As well as all welfare and benefit,
Is empty, void,
And ultimately pure.
“They do not cause one to abide or dwell
In any of the realms of existence;
Instead, they cause one to abide, disengaged,
In dhāraṇī and absorption.
“Everything is beyond coming and going—
Not virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral.
All marks, such as those that benefit
Oneself and others, are pure.
“Therefore, they cause one not to dwell 
On the qualities of a supreme being
Or the qualities of the hearers,
Ordinary beings, or the buddhas. 
“They pacify all the acts related to
The limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
The limit of its arising, and its limit,
Up to its peace.
“They cause one to abandon 
All arising, non-arising,
Suffering, happiness,
Praise, and criticism.
“Both the realization of all these perfect manifestations 
And these empty dhāraṇīs
Cause one to dwell within
The domain of the buddhas;
“They place one firmly within the abode of the buddhas’ display,
Within the buddhas’ miraculous powers,
And within the buddhas’ wisdom.
They also cause one to dwell within the power 
“Of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
Within the power of the limit of the arising of the eye,
And within the power of the limit of the eye, 
Up to the power of its peace.
“The same applies 
To all the twenty-five phenomena— 
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body
Up to words and names.
“These dhāraṇīs cause one to perfect
The exalted power of the thus-gone ones.
Once these dhāraṇīs have caused one to perfect such a magnificent power,
One will enter the abodes of all the thus-gone ones.
“By dwelling in the domain of all the thus-gone ones,
One will cause all worldly beings,
Such as the hosts of asuras,
To abandon their rigid clinging and observe pure conduct.
“One will delight all the countless hundreds of thousands of yakṣas
And all the countless kumbhāṇḍas;
One will also tame and delight all the innumerable 
Retinues of gandharvas and rākṣasas.
“Even if the retinues of Brahmā
Attempted to utter their words and express their meaning 
With sublime melodious voices,
They would not be able to reveal them.
“They cannot be fathomed
Through any mental states;
They cannot be grasped 
Through any mental states.
“These dhāraṇīs cannot be apprehended 
By the eyes, or by anything up to the body;
They cannot be apprehended 
By the eyes, or by anything up to the domain of the eyes.
“The same applies 
To all the twenty-five phenomena— 
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body
Up to words and names.
“They cause one to understand all marks—
The fact that the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, 
The limit of its arising, its limit, and its cognition, 
Up to its peace,
“Are devoid of self, being, 
Mind, life principle, 
Person, marks, action, 
Going, coming, and so forth.
“Furthermore, they cause one to realize 
The eye of reality,
The eye accomplished on the basis of Dharma teachings,
The eye of wisdom, the eye of insight,
“The eye of Brahmā, the divine eye,
The eye achieved by being born in the Brahmā realms,
The eye achieved by being born in the god realms,
The eye of the karmic ripening of Brahmā,
“The eye of the karmic ripening of the gods,
The eye arising from the causes of Brahmā,
The eye arising from the causes of the gods,
The eye of divine miraculous powers,
“The eye of divine diligence,
The eye of inferior births,
The eye of noble births,
The eye that relinquishes the world of the lord of death,
“The eye of the nāgas, the yakṣas, and the kumbhāṇḍas,
The eye associated with torment,
The eye free of torment,
The pure eye, the impure eye,
“The broad eye and the narrow eye,
The eye of the hearer’s vehicle,
The eye of concentration,
The eye of absorption,
“The eye arising from experience,
The eye arising from perception,
The eye arising from desire,
The eye free from desire,
“The eye arising from causes,
The eye arising from non-causes,
The concurrent eye,
The nonconcurrent eye,
“The eye arising based on the gateways,
The eye not arising from the gateways,
The eye arising from causes and conditions,
The eye arising from the gateway of the cause,
“The eye not made of flesh,
The eye of pure wisdom,
The eye of nonexistence,
And the eye of nonapprehending.
“The same applies 
To all the twenty-five phenomena—
From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body
Up to words and names.”
At that moment, through the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous powers,
The Blessed One manifested in the sky 
The most sublime, boundless, and melodious voices, 
Which proclaimed this exalted dhāraṇī Dharma:
Sile male male siddhe aini siṅe kulu niyu kulu neyu kule male kunote alaśi asile sisilete susile sile sile khyivile avile suṭecana dhani mani kani kalate sukale praya śanaṅni anulosikye bilome subhanireśhe aśirile saramaparaphunte paribhahe dharani dheśuciha sudhe acana bhuvogaganaṅ kudpano bhasabhanaṅ panridhuriya niparikanoni manaṃbha suruciṭa pana-ācara abhelaviryapratiṣṭha ha dharini asiṭa loṅibhi.
“These dhāraṇīs have been obtained by the buddhas.
Their great powers are complete, and their insights are infinite;
They cause one to abandon clinging,
And they purify recollection.
“They are formless, beyond coming and going,
Beyond all cardinal and intermediate directions,
Devoid of marks, inexpressible,
And beyond concepts.
“If bodhisattvas accomplish them, they will eventually attain coolness.
Even if each of their words were explained
Through hundreds of billions of verses,
Their scope could never be apprehended.
“They are praised by many noble beings,
And highly revered
By all the numerous assemblies 
That are pure and free from clinging.
“Through the power of the virtue 
Created by these dhāraṇīs,
Afflictions are completely overcome and pacified,
And the most excellent benefits are gained.
“They lead to qualities and insight as great as a vast ocean, 
They cause one to achieve acceptance,
And they cause the mind to be at ease and unshakable.
They are always cultivated by the bodhisattvas and praised by the wise.
“They liberate from poverty and provide wealth and prosperity.
These dhāraṇīs increase qualities 
And cause one to be constantly adorned 
By words of truth, such as emptiness.
“Since they go beyond words,
They are known as empty essence.
Since they go beyond mind and consciousness, 
They are known as essence of phenomena.
“These dhāraṇīs always lead to stainlessness and purity.
Being grounded in genuine wisdom, 
They reveal many benefits
And generate joy and faith in many sentient beings.
“They bring great delight
To the countless retinues of yakṣas,
The retinues of kumbhāṇḍas,
And also the rulers of the starving spirits.
“These dhāraṇī mantras 
Are utterly peaceful and beyond concepts.
They cause happiness to manifest for all beings
Out of love for them. 
“Though they constantly remain within the realms of beings 
For hundreds of thousands of eons, 
Bringing infinite benefits,
They remain immaculate and unsullied.
“They bring great joy 
To countless sentient beings
By revealing the ambrosia-like Dharma
Through hundreds of thousands of verses.
“The countless buddhas of the past
Relied on these dhāraṇīs
With the purest trust 
And so perpetually realize reality.
“When they hear these dhāraṇīs,
The minds of Brahmā, Śakra, the gods,
The kings of the nāgas, and the asuras
Become filled with joy. 
“The lands where these dhāraṇī mantras are found
Remain perpetually free from harm, 
Turmoil, diseases, 
Suffering, and misery.
“With minds filled with joy,
All sentient beings make the aspiration
That these dhāraṇīs
Constantly remain within their minds.
“If these dhāraṇī mantras
Always remain connected to the body, the mind,
The palate, the mouth, and the lips,
Boundless qualities will be generated.
“If they are held constantly,
Countless qualities will be achieved,
Many sentient beings will benefit,
And everyone will experience joy.
“Since these dhāraṇī mantras
Cause one to abandon negative deeds
And reveal the sacred Dharma, 
Infinite eloquence will be achieved.
“The doubts of hundreds of thousands of sentient beings 
Will be cleared away,
Pride will be overcome,
And boundless qualities will be achieved.
“The wise always contemplate
And persistently accomplish
These dhāraṇī mantras—
These utterly profound and secret teachings.
“Donning the armor of insight,
They completely overcome the afflictions
And develop the qualities of their minds
With great dedication and without feeling weary.
“These glorious and excellent
Dhāraṇī mantras
Cause beings to realize the limits
Of exhaustion, non-exhaustion, arising, and non-arising.
“Since they are adorned
With those various insights,
Hundreds of thousands of thus-gone ones
Revere and worship them.
“These dhāraṇīs 
Produce the two feet of knowledge,
Place one firmly within the supreme absorption,
And cause one to follow the path to awakening;
“They cause one to pursue tranquility and insight
And to realize undefiled insight.
Through the strength of the faculty of deep faith,
They perfect the two hands.
“They cause one to achieve the two breasts
Through diligence and patience,
And to achieve the characteristics of the crown of the head
Through the perfection of insight. 
“By making a thread with those discourses 
And using it for the garland of the four individual knowledges,
One will be adorned with all the various unequaled qualities
That were accomplished in the past.
“Since these dhāraṇī mantras
Are endowed with countless excellent qualities,
One will realize all the gateways,
Such as the past and future limits of the eye, 
“The limits of its exhaustion and non-exhaustion,
Its arising and non-arising,
Its limit and non-limit,
Its engagement and disengagement,
“Its cognition and noncognition,
Its complete nonexistence, its absence of origination,
Its quiescence, its absence of self, its absence of person,
Its absence of life principle, and its absence of sentient being. 
“The same applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
The six sense objects, and the four great elements,
Up to the names produced in the world.
“The sublime and sacred dhāraṇīs
That were praised earlier
Are endowed with the qualities of complete disengagement,
And they belong to the domain of the buddhas.
“Therefore, the true meaning of these dhāraṇīs
Cannot be expressed in words.
Nevertheless, to accord with worldly beings,
They have been expressed here with imputed words.” 
Then, together with his numerous retinues, the Blessed One arrived at the house of Candraprabhakumāra and sat down on the throne that had been prepared for him. When he saw the Blessed One sitting on the throne, Candraprabhakumārabhūta brought the most sublime offering articles and offered them to the Thus-Gone One and his great assemblies. That offering was entirely accomplished through his inconceivable power and the roots of virtue generated by his extraordinary concentration, absorption, and concentration qualities. Since he made that offering not only for himself but in order for all the countless sentient beings to strive for awakening and achieve great benefits, that act of worship was all-pervasive and satisfied everyone.
When the Blessed One had finished his lunch, he said these words to Candraprabhakumārabhūta in front of the numerous retinues: “Kumāra, if noble sons or daughters who follow the Great Vehicle accomplish the accumulation of generosity, they will be endowed with eighty types of eminent qualities. What are those eighty? (1) They will ripen sentient beings and attract them with pleasant words. (2) They will perfect the excellent marks. (3) All their faculties will be complete. (4) They will abandon saṃsāra and actualize nirvāṇa. (5) Their afflictions will be exhausted and they will achieve supreme might. (6) They will be adorned with perfect qualities and buddha realms. (7) Their retinues will be pure. (8) They will be endowed with great majesty. (9) They will be endowed with perfect insight. (10) They will accomplish the most eminent activities. (11) They will perfect unequaled and unsurpassed conduct. (12) They will overcome all latent patterns and develop the omniscient conduct of the thus-gone ones. (13) Their bodies and relics will be worshiped by all worldly beings, hearers, and solitary buddhas.

Kumāra, if noble sons or daughters accomplish the accumulation of generosity, they will be endowed with and perfect those eighty types of eminent qualities.”
At that moment, the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“I have briefly described here
The eighty supreme benefits 
Achieved by the wise bodhisattvas
Who are endowed with the accumulation of generosity.
“I will now teach a little bit
About all the qualities, 
Boundless and hard-to-conceive,
That arise on the basis of generosity.
“Those accumulations of generosity
That you have offered with an impartial mind
In the presence of these numerous assemblies
Should be accomplished by all the wise ones.
“The mass of merit accumulated
Through these acts of generosity is inconceivable;
It will cause you to perfect
All the physical adornments of the major and minor marks. 
“All your birthplaces, your family lines,
Your lands, your households,
Your renown, your bodies, and your minds
Will be pure.
“All the divine miraculous displays,
The palaces, the goddesses,
And the pure, unimpeded eloquence
Originate from generosity.
“The buddhas praise 
The supreme accumulation of generosity
By proclaiming that it is 
The foremost foundation of awakening.
“Diligent bodhisattvas
Who have no doubt about generosity
Accomplish it persistently
And with full conviction.
“If bodhisattvas perfect
The accumulation of merit
With a generous mindset,
They will achieve the awakening of the buddhas.
“Since they perfect the supreme miraculous powers
Through the strength of generosity,
Even if they cause ten million realms to shake,
Sentient beings will not be harmed.
“The power of the practice of generosity
Induces pure discipline, erudition,
Genuine trust, diligence,
Absorption, and undefiled insight.
“The power of the practice of generosity
Induces the powers, the strengths, the authentic path,
The exertions, the bases of miraculous power,
And the abandonment of latent patterns.
“The power of the practice of generosity
Causes the boundless Dharma
To be taught in billions of realms
Through pure and melodious voices.
“By practicing generosity with sincere faith,
One will swiftly achieve the miraculous powers;
In order to perfect those miraculous powers,
One should therefore practice generosity persistently.
“If rulers—like those who play freely
In their sublime palaces
While surrounded by retinues
Of countless gods and many hundreds of thousands 
“Of asuras, nāgas, and yakṣas—
See beings who exert themselves in the practice of generosity, 
They will all stand up, welcome them,
Lay out seats for them, and worship them.
“Since the persons who practice generosity
Are endowed with perfect great majesty
And have gained mastery over the miraculous powers,
They will attract the kings of the gods.
“All the kumbhāṇḍas and the yakṣas
Will go to them for refuge,
And the gandharvas and their retinues 
Will worship them by playing music.
“All bandits will become kind,
All hostile beings will leave for faraway places,
One’s wealth will never decline,
And the storerooms will always be full.
“By practicing generosity,
The supreme accumulations will be perfected,
And, until awakened wisdom is achieved,
They will not engage in the practices of non-Buddhists.
“One will never fall sick, 
And one will be protected by the dhāraṇīs.
Even the extraordinary strengths 
Will originate from generosity.
“In that way, those who practice generosity
Will accomplish the path of awakening;
They will never meet nonvirtuous friends
But will gain friends with conducive behaviors.
“Furthermore, since bodhisattvas
Who gather the accumulation of generosity
Will perfect the inconceivable dhāraṇīs
And insight,
“They will reveal thorough comprehension
Through countless verses.
Since they will be unimpeded in all respects,
They will not lose the essential meaning.
“They will be firmly dedicated
To the vast attitude set on awakening,
Their discipline will be pure and perfect,
And they will overcome the activities of Māra.
“They will not cling to the five sense pleasures
But will pursue recollection one-pointedly.
Since their minds are constantly free of delusion,
They will not crave sense pleasures.
“They will genuinely understand
The affliction of anger,
And they will be free of clinging and delusion
With respect to all the domains of experience.
“Those persons will properly understand 
All afflictions as well as everything else—
From the defects that arise 
From the gathering of causes and conditions, 
Up to the causes 
Of the qualities of the buddhas, 
The causes of their causes, 
And the effects of those causes.
“Since they will clearly understand
The causes of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They will completely abandon delusion
And will not cling to the eye.
“Since they will also clearly understand
The causes of the limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, its disengagement, 
Its cognition, its nonexistence, 
“And its unborn nature,
Up to its quiescence and so forth,
They will completely abandon delusion
And will not cling to the eye.
“They will realize that the expression past limit of the eye
Is a mere imputation
That accords with the world’s conventions,
And that it is therefore, ultimately, completely nonexistent.
“They will also realize that the expressions
The limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, its disengagement, its cognition, 
Its complete nonexistence, and its unborn nature, 
“Up to its peace,
Are all mere imputations
That accord with the world’s conventions,
And that therefore they, too, are ultimately nonexistent.
“Since they will realize that the expression
Past limit of the eye
Arises from the gathering of causes and conditions,
They will not cling to it at all.
“Since they will realize that the expression
Future limit of the eye
Arises from the gathering of causes and conditions,
They will not cling to it at all.
“Since they will realize that the expressions
The limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, its disengagement, its cognition, 
Its complete nonexistence, and its unborn nature, 
“Up to its peace,
Arise from the gathering 
Of causes and conditions,
They will not cling to them at all.
“Since they will realize that the expression
Past limit of the eye
Is intrinsically undefinable,
They will not cling to it at all.
“Since they will realize that the expression
Future limit of the eye
Is intrinsically undefinable, 
They will not cling to it at all.
“Since they will realize 
That expressions such as
The limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, its disengagement, its cognition, 
“Its complete nonexistence, and its unborn nature, 
Up to its peace,
Are intrinsically undefinable,
They will not cling to them at all.
“The same should be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
The six sense objects, and the four great elements,
Up to the names produced in the world.
“Since they realize
That desire and the path of the buddhas
Are intrinsically inseparable,
They will not cling to desire.
“All the paths of the buddhas
Should be pursued on the basis of afflictions. 
Those who clearly understand that these are intrinsically inseparable
Will enter the gateway of thorough comprehension.

And that thorough comprehension is desire,

Then the Blessed One said to Candraprabhakumārabhūta, “Noble son, the followers of the Great Vehicle who wish to accomplish the dhāraṇīs that were revealed earlier should stay away from eighty types of persons. What are they?

Then the Blessed One spoke these verses: 
“Those who do not understand
The limit of the arising of the eye and the limit of its exhaustion 
Are deluded with respect to thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore stay away from them.
“Those who realize that the eye
Is devoid of a self and a sentient being
Abide by thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore attend to them.
“Those who realize that the eye
Transcends birth, exhaustion, and words
Abide by thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore attend to them.
“Those who realize that the eye
Is disengagement and nonabiding
Abide by thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore attend to them.

That the nature of the eye is nonabiding
Abide by thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore attend to them.
“Those who realize that the eye
Is beyond engagement and devoid of the characteristics of form
Abide by thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore attend to them.
“Those who realize that the eye
Is unborn and intrinsically peace
Abide by thorough comprehension;
The wise should therefore attend to them.
“Those who realize that the eye intrinsically lacks the marks of the eye 
Are praised by the buddhas, and they realize that the eye is undefinable;
They abide by thorough comprehension, 
So the wise should therefore attend to them.
“Those who realize that the eye intrinsically lacks the marks of the eye 
Realize that it is beyond the reach of thoughts, apprehending, and explanations; 
They abide by thorough comprehension,
So the wise should therefore attend to them.
“Likewise, since the essential nature of dhāraṇīs
Cannot be expressed in words,
It is devoid of sides
And will not be reached by the mind.
“That Dharma is beyond joy
And does not dwell on anger;
Since it is unshakable like the king of mountains,
It cannot be apprehending, even if it is expressed.
“Both thorough comprehension and the self
Do not truly exist;
Since the self is intrinsically empty,
Thorough comprehension is also nonexistent.
“Thorough comprehension is intrinsically empty,
But immature beings consider it something existent.
Since their conceptions are improper,
They do not study, and experience misery. 
“Some think that both desire
And thorough comprehension are empty;
Ultimately, however, those two thoughts themselves
Are also completely beyond apprehension.
“If emptiness is realized to be empty,
Thorough comprehension is also nonexistent,
And everything up to the factors of awakening
And absorption is also empty.
“Those who understand 
Thorough comprehension, emptiness,
And everything up to absorption
Will also genuinely understand the eye.
“Those who genuinely realize
The limit of the exhaustion of the eye
Will finally perfect
The gateway of thorough comprehension.
“Those who genuinely realize
