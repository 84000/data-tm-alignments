Thus did I hear at one time.

This immeasurably large assembly had gathered around the Blessed One and was respectfully serving and honoring him. Among those included in the assembly at that time was a bodhisattva great being named Anantamati. He rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, I have a few doubts. If I were to ask the Thus-Gone One some questions, would he be so kind as to teach me?”

This armor is an armor that protects all beings, an armor that cuts through the thicket of all views, an armor that defeats the forces of Māra, an armor that embraces insight, an armor that is a boundless bridge, an armor that liberates from heavy burdens, an armor that develops pure faith, an armor that observes discipline, an armor that purifies the storehouse of action, an armor that is a powerful treasury that purifies everything, an armor that is a treasury of skillful means, an armor that eliminates all clinging, and an armor of irreversible, irreproachable insight.

Any bodhisattva great being who one-pointedly tames them will scatter and eliminate many māras. [F.78.a] Because they are capable of abiding unwaveringly in such armor, all beings are unable to harm them. Why is this? Because this armor has no marks, it is not an object that can be perceived with the vision of sentient beings, and therefore all beings are incapable of seeing or comprehending it. Because bodhisattva great beings have understood all phenomena, they can truly see and comprehend the donning of the great armor. In order to protect all beings, they do not cling to any phenomenon.

They do not see that there is a self capable of donning armor, nor do they see an armor that is donned by a self.

When the bodhisattva great beings don such armor, they don the armor that has been donned by the thus-gone ones, so they do not apprehend a body, they do not apprehend speech, and they do not apprehend a mind. Therefore, since they do not apprehend, they have abandoned all concepts. If any bodhisattva great being were to dwell on even the smallest phenomenon or apprehend even the smallest phenomenon, they could not be said to have donned the armor, to don the armor, or to be donning the armor.

If hearers, solitary buddhas, and other lesser beings—who are bound to the world and associated with the world—are manifestly proud, put their trust in non-Buddhists, and do not desire to hear even the name of this vehicle, need we mention that they will not be able to mount it?’ However, if beings who sport in the inconceivable domain mount this vehicle, they will proceed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, according to their incredibly noble aspiration. 
{milestone:{label:1.185,id:UT22084-040-002-222}}“Anantamati, this vehicle is limitless, for a limit to its beginning, interim, and end cannot be realized. This vehicle’s limits are eliminated, for its limits cannot be apprehended. A boundless limit is this vehicle’s limit. An immeasurable limit is this vehicle’s limit. Anantamati, this vehicle has no outer limit and no inner limit. It has not even the slightest limit that can be eliminated. When I say that its limits are eliminated, it is the absence of even the slightest limit that is described as limits are eliminated. When limits are not conceptualized, this is what is described as limits are eliminated. Thus, I make the designation that this vehicle’s limits are eliminated. The absence of a limit is said to be its inner limit. The absence of a limit is said to be its outer limit. The absence of a limit is described as a limit. Within that limit, no inner limit can be apprehended. Because they cannot be apprehended, the outer limit and the inner limit—which are without limits and without elimination—enter the gateway of limits. Because it enters the gateway of limits, this vehicle goes beyond; but in that going beyond, there is also nothing that can be apprehended.
{milestone:{label:1.186,id:UT22084-040-002-223}}“Anantamati, what are the limits? [F.82.b] They are the limits of nihilism and eternalism. Because they engage with language, limits are actually not limits. Those limits of nihilism and eternalism are themselves without limits, because the mark of those limits is boundlessness. What I am calling a limit here involves no concepts. Because conceptualization is eliminated, limits are transcended, and nihilism and eternalism are abandoned.
{milestone:{label:1.187,id:UT22084-040-002-224}}“Anantamati, those who maintain the belief in a truly existing self take the gateway of limits as a support, while those who do not maintain the belief in a truly existing self do not cling to the gateway of limits. Because they do not cling to it, they transcend the limits of nihilism and eternalism. Anantamati, the limits of nihilism and eternalism have no true existence—they are merely deceptive terms. These two limits are conceptualized within the context of the three realms of existence; but if one does not accept these two limits, and does not accord with these two limits, then they can be transcended. Because they have eliminated the view of a truly existing self, they will have no clinging to the gateway of the two limits. Anantamati, bodhisattva great beings who have not yet discarded the belief in a truly existing self cannot be said to have donned the great armor and mounted the Great Vehicle, for they cling to this limit-gateway. Thus, even if they desire to abandon such limits, by arousing the notion of abandoning limits they are still conceptualizing the former and latter limits. It is therefore only bodhisattva great beings who have discarded the belief in a truly existing self who can be said to have donned the great armor and mounted the Great Vehicle, for they have no clinging to these limits. As such, they transcend these two limits, and so they proceed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening within a highly comfortable vehicle.

[F.83.a] By applying skillful means to gather tranquility and special insight and train in their lack of marks, they will attain the realization of marklessness. When the absence of marks is experienced, the buddhas bestow the illumination of Dharma. Through the illumination of Dharma, all limits are eliminated, and there will also be no clinging to the limits that were eliminated, so that there is not even the slightest limit. Thus, regarding the gateway of limits, there will be no association or dissociation, and no mental engagement or disengagement. With skillful means concerning all phenomena, they will abide stably in tranquility and special insight, and will thus obtain the boundless, great illumination of Dharma. Due to the illumination of Dharma, they will abandon all darkness and hair-raising fears. Thereby, raising the great victory banner of the Dharma, resounding the great voice of Brahmā, and roaring the great lion’s roar, they will announce to all beings, ‘All of you, come quickly to this Great Vehicle, the comfortable vehicle, the Great Leader’s vehicle, the vehicle of great procession, and proceed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening!’ They will reveal the illumination of Dharma to all beings, and with this illumination of Dharma, they will be able to lead beings to don the great armor and mount the Great Vehicle.

They must form the aspiration, ‘May beings become liberated by donning the great armor and mounting the Great Vehicle.’ When bodhisattva great beings abide in this type of conduct, [F.83.b] they will gather buddha fields and purify buddha fields. They will also gather all the qualities of hearers and bodhisattvas. Thereby, they will proceed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening with this boundless ocean of qualities.

Thus, it accords with no place, it accords with the realm of phenomena, and it accords with the armor. Anyone who earnestly practices this Great Vehicle, which is commensurate with the realm of phenomena, will proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.
{milestone:{label:1.191,id:UT22084-040-002-228}}“Anantamati, to draw an analogy, the realm of phenomena has no impurities or stains, and therefore nobody can destroy or stain it. Likewise, this Great Vehicle also is indestructible and unstainable. Because it is indestructible and unstainable, it proceeds toward omniscient wisdom, which is why this vehicle is called the Great Vehicle. Since this vehicle is unimpeded, all worldly gods, humans, and asuras are unable to turn it back. Because it is without clinging, it proceeds toward omniscient wisdom, which is why this vehicle is called the Great Vehicle. That which is called the Great Vehicle is the great array. There is no array anywhere that is not included in this Great Vehicle.”
{milestone:{label:1.192,id:UT22084-040-002-229}}Then the bodhisattva great being Anantamati asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how could there be conditioned arrays within this vehicle?” [F.84.a]
The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, “Anantamati, thus it is, thus it is. In accord with worldly conventions, I have fully taught all conditioned arrays within this vehicle. Anantamati, whether we are talking about a universal monarch, Śakra, who is lord of the gods, or the king of the Brahmā heavens, all of them also have arisen, presently arise, and will arise from this Great Vehicle. Though they remain, respectively, at the levels of enjoying universal dominion, the state of Śakra, and the state of Brahmā, they do not become stained by the faults of the afflictions of saṃsāra. They are able to evaluate each of their desires, and with such evaluation, they become weary of them and are thereby able to realize the path of liberation.

They see its faults and fully understand liberation. Thereby, when it comes to all the phenomena and all the arrays that I have not already taught, according to the characteristic marks of this vehicle, they will be able to understand those phenomena and those arrays, and so they will proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.”

Thus, I transcended limits, dispelled darkness, and offered protection from fear. Through my great diligence, I joyfully heard this Teaching of the Armor array of bodhisattva great beings and the array of the Great Vehicle from countless billions of buddhas, which caused me great joy. When cultivating this Dharma, I served and venerated those blessed buddhas, and I did not produce such thoughts as, ‘I am donning such an armor. I possess such an armor. I have obtained such a Dharma. I possess such a Dharma. I possess a Dharma of such-and-such a category.’
{milestone:{label:1.243,id:UT22084-040-002-292}}“At that time, I had no sense of self, I had abandoned the view of a truly existing self, and I had abandoned the conceit of a self. My mind contained no sense of high or low, and no concepts. Out of my desire to gather all beings, I upheld the Dharma treasury of all the buddhas and thus-gone ones and ripened countless billions of beings, without ever having a single thought of fatigue in my mind. [F.86.b] During this period I never abandoned the armor, and I always rode in the boundless vehicle. Therefore, in all my lifetimes I overcame and defeated the forces, retinues, and armies of Māra. I tamed all those who were distracted on the paths of the carakas, lokāyatas, and parivrājakas, as well as other non-Buddhists who accorded with them, and established them in happiness. I defeated all opposing teachers. I tamed all the non-Buddhists. I caused those beings who had gone astray to abide in this vehicle, restrained by virtue. I explained and taught beings about the armor and the armor array. By teaching beings such facets of the comfortable Great Vehicle, all those who abided in this vehicle achieved all comforts. In this way they attained all conditioned comforts, the universal monarch’s comforts, the royal comforts of Śakra and Brahmā, and all unconditioned comforts. When I taught this Dharma to beings, they took it up, and they were thus able to be born into the noble family, raise the great victory banner, roar the lion’s roar, and proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.

Since they completely understand and see all phenomena, they have no conceptualization of them. Why is this? Because those bodhisattva great beings abide stably on the correct path, they understand accurately. [F.87.a] Because they proceed on the correct path, they see accurately. Purifying themselves correctly, they do not conceptualize, nor do they not conceptualize, seeing and understanding the sameness of conceptualization and nonconceptualization. Those who see phenomena to pursue and strive for do not comprehend sameness. Therefore, they do not abide in accurate and pure understanding and seeing. Those who have neither conceptuality nor nonconceptuality do not fixate upon or cling to conceptuality or nonconceptuality. Because they are without fixation or clinging, they abandon conceptuality and nonconceptuality. On this path, there is no pity, no conditioned activity, no imputation, and no acceptance or rejection. Those who abide on the path of evenness do not conceptualize the past, present, or future. Because of this, they understand all concepts and latent tendencies without exception. Since they abide in the unmistaken truth of the sameness of all phenomena, it is said that they abide on the correct path. 
{milestone:{label:1.245,id:UT22084-040-002-294}}“Anantamati, what are the path and the pure path? They are what is known as the eightfold path of the noble ones: correct view, correct intention, correct speech, correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness, and correct absorption. Through the correct view, the belief in a truly existing self is abandoned, and one transcends all domains involving views. Thus, all views, in all times and places, are entirely purified. By fully comprehending conceptualization, distinguishing conceptualization, and pervasive conceptualization, [F.87.b] one becomes free from conceptualization, distinguishing conceptualization, and pervasive conceptualization. By not abiding in mistaken thinking and by eliminating mistaken thinking, one will be able to see correct livelihood and also the notion of correct livelihood. By seeing what is pure livelihood and abiding in pure livelihood, one will observe pure physical, verbal, and mental actions, and one will observe correct action. With the correct view of verbal action, one will be able to see and understand both words and those who speak them. Thus, by abiding in correct speech, any discordant factors are purified. Through the view of correct effort, one is able to gather diligence and abide in proper diligence. With the correct view of mindfulness, one remains without recollection, speculation, or appropriation. With mindfulness thus purified, one abides in correct mindfulness. With the correct view of absorption, one relies on no support while engaged in absorption. Having purified the view of absorption, one abides in correct absorption. 
{milestone:{label:1.246,id:UT22084-040-002-295}}“Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings see in this manner, they attain the correct view of universal purity, and thus abide on the pure path. This pure path is that which holy beings cultivate, the wise respect, the noble ones cherish, and the thus-gone ones praise. Thus, it is not a territory traveled by māras, their retinues, their messengers, or any gods allied with them. It is not the domain traversed by those who crave and cling to non-Buddhist paths, those who engage in disputes, those who are immersed in the thicket of views, those who have lost the path, or the lokāyatas. [F.88.a] Nor is it the domain traversed by anyone who desires nirvāṇa. Why is this? Those who dwell in the unconditioned conceptualize nirvāṇa. As they conceptualize nirvāṇa, so then do they conceptualize all conditioned phenomena. Why is this? Since the realm of nirvāṇa{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-040-002-296}} transcends all movements of conceptual thought, even the unconditioned has no existence there. That being the case, what need is there to mention the conditioned not having any existence there either? Because this path purifies all concepts, there are not even the subtlest concepts about the unconditioned. That being the case, how could there be any concepts about the conditioned? As long as one conceptualizes the path of the noble ones, one cannot be said to be abiding on the path of the noble ones. Someone who abandons all movements of conceptual thought can be said to be abiding on the path of the noble ones, abiding on the path of fearlessness, abiding on the path of utter peace, and abiding on the path of happiness. This path leads to a place devoid of aging, sickness, death, anguish, and suffering. This path leads to the absence of essential nature; it leads beyond any locus of essential nature. This path leads to the place where both essential nature and nonessential nature are abandoned. This path leads to the place that possesses no demonstrable marks and that cannot be characterized by form. Since this path pervades everything like space, it brings one to the unsurpassed great palace. All who make this journey will not reverse course. Thus, they will achieve myriad pleasures. This great palace is furthermore indemonstrable and lacks the marks of entities. [F.88.b] Thus, it involves neither the slightest conditioned thing, nor the slightest unconditioned thing. Because it has already extinguished conditioned things and abandoned unconditioned things, it does not provide beings with either conditioned or unconditioned happiness whatsoever. 
{milestone:{label:1.247,id:UT22084-040-002-297}}“Anantamati, many beings desire a conditioned nirvāṇa; they do not even seek conditioned happiness, so how could they be able to enter this great palace? Because this great palace is unconditioned, cool, and quiescent, it is called nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering. Because it stops attachment, aggression, and ignorance, removes latent tendencies, rends the web of worldly views, dries up the river of ignorance, extracts the poisoned arrows of the afflictions, and exhausts nonvirtuous phenomena, it is called nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering. Since it is far removed from the disease of pride and all the afflictions caused by much suffering, it is called nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering. Because it is not of the domain of the mind, the intellect, consciousness, or mental functions, it is called nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering. Since it pacifies all debates and all ties to existence, all the way up to the perception of Dharma, it is called nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering. Since it cuts through mental inclinations and the striving they engender, and because it is free from the marks of conceptualization and its objects, it is called nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering.
{milestone:{label:1.248,id:UT22084-040-002-298}}“Anantamati, this is the very essence of great nirvāṇa, the supreme transcendence. Since nirvāṇa is boundless, it cannot be described. If it entailed any destination, it could not be this path, since this path is beyond words and thus also indescribable. Given that bodhisattva great beings travel on this path toward the great palace of nirvāṇa, they can establish countless beings on it. [F.89.a] Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings proceed on this path, they do not become tired, and they do not become distressed. According to what they wish to seek, they manifest at will. According to where they intend to manifest, they manifest in each place, and each manifestation accordingly attracts beings and teaches them the Dharma, causing all beings to attain great joy. Why is this? Because this path is unequalled, it purifies all discordant factors and brings all activities to completion. Thus, all the blessed buddhas, hearers, and solitary buddhas all proceed on this path and do not contravene it. As long as they have not reached that ground, and as long as they have not fulfilled their aspirations, they never depart from it. What is that ground? It is the ground of nirvāṇa, the ground of the great palace. To draw an analogy, since nothing can illustrate space, there is no other example besides space itself to illustrate space. Thus, to this vast, great, empty void, we apply the label space. The palace of nirvāṇa is similar. It is a great, empty void, in which there is no autonomous self and nothing pertaining to self. Therefore, even if all beings enter it, there is not even a single hair’s worth of anything to grasp on to. It is an open and vast emptiness, an utter void that is immeasurably vast. Therefore, it is called great nirvāṇa and the great palace.
{milestone:{label:1.249,id:UT22084-040-002-299}}“Anantamati, this extraordinarily noble path of all the bodhisattva great beings is not something that the hearers and solitary buddhas can attain. Those who abide on this path accomplish all the accumulations of merit and obtain irreversibility. Thereby, they enact great benefit for beings. Manifesting a great array of extraordinarily noble conduct, [F.89.b] they proceed by means of this path. Such an array is also not something that the hearers and solitary buddhas can possess. While bodhisattva great beings are abiding on this path, even if they act as universal monarchs, they will have no ownership of anything. With great power, they will perform miracles and gain realization of both the world and what is beyond the world. Even if they act as divine rulers such as Śakra and Brahmā, they will be free from attachment and clinging. As such, they will abandon pride and aspire to encounter buddhas, delight in hearing the true Dharma, ripen countless thousands of gods, and endeavor toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.”

{milestone:{label:1.344,id:UT22084-040-002-399}}“Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings don the great armor, mount the Great Vehicle, and abide on this path, [F.94.b] if they fail to universally radiate love, compassion, joy, and equanimity toward all sentient beings, or if they fail to cherish all beings like themselves, then this great armor, great path, and Great Vehicle would not even be supported by the great earth, nor would all beings be able to rely upon{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-040-002-400}} it. Thus, it must be out of love and an altruistic mind for others that they don the great armor, mount the Great Vehicle, and abide on the path. All worldly gods, humans, and asuras are unable to course in such an armor, such a Great Vehicle, and such a great path, which also cannot be seen by any ordinary, childish beings who cling to the world and abide in worldliness.
{milestone:{label:1.345,id:UT22084-040-002-401}}“Moreover, because the bodhisattva great beings don the great armor out of love for all beings, they consecrate the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind through the armor’s power, such that the earth element does not tremble or quake, and no beings grow afraid of it. They also have similar effects on the water, fire, and wind elements. 
{milestone:{label:1.346,id:UT22084-040-002-402}}“Moreover, having first developed the mind of awakening and the aspiration to don the armor, bodhisattva great beings now don the great armor; and having mounted the Great Vehicle, they proceed along the pure path until they have only one birth remaining, when they proceed to the tree of awakening and take their seat at the site of awakening. If in this period they fail to consecrate the great trichiliocosm—this firm ground that is made of vajra—it will tremble and quake, for even though it is fashioned of vajra, it will not be able to withstand this great armor, this great path, or this Great Vehicle. [F.95.a]
{milestone:{label:1.347,id:UT22084-040-002-403}}Moreover, through their past aspirations, bodhisattva great beings have aroused great love and compassion for beings, and have expressed their praise for the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions. Thus, if they should fail to consecrate the great vajra base, as well as Mount Meru, the jewel mountains, and the other majestic mountains, they would be unable to support this great armor, this great path, or this Great Vehicle.

In order to cause beings to find happiness, they don the great armor, mount the Great Vehicle, and abide on this path, proceeding toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening. 
{milestone:{label:1.349,id:UT22084-040-002-405}}“Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings don the great armor, they don the armor of insight, brandish the weapons of insight, and perform the dedication of great insight. Mounting the vehicle of dedication, they shine the illumination of insight. Abiding on this path of illumination, they investigate phenomena with the eye of bright insight, endeavoring toward omniscient wisdom. To gather the wisdom of omniscience, for the sake of all beings, the bodhisattvas cultivate the perfections of insight, discipline, patience, diligence, and concentration. [F.95.b] Each of these are guided by insight, accomplished by insight, gathered by insight, and completely dedicated toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.” 
{milestone:{label:1.350,id:UT22084-040-002-406}}The bodhisattva great being Anantamati then remarked to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, it is amazing how the various forms of insight possessed by the bodhisattva great beings pervade everywhere and are capable of gathering and accomplishing the Dharma of immeasurably many buddhas.”
{milestone:{label:1.351,id:UT22084-040-002-407}}The Blessed One responded to the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, “Anantamati, that is true, that is true! What you have said is correct. The various forms of insight possessed by bodhisattva great beings pervade everywhere and encompass all Dharma. Donning the great armor, they mount the Great Vehicle and abide on the great path. Then, guided by insight, they proceed upon it. Anantamati, even if one has insight, if one is not guided by such insight, one will not proceed properly on this path. If one possesses insight and is guided by insight, then one will engage with and follow this insight, as it pervades everywhere. One will gather through insight, and will exercise restraint through insight. From that point onward, one can be said to have donned the great armor, to have mounted the Great Vehicle, and to abide on the great path. With the delightful Dharma, one will then benefit worldly beings and open the eye of insight. As one investigates with the eye of insight, one’s insight body will shine forth, emitting a great illumination, and one will proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.

Anantamati, even if I spoke for countless eons about the sublime beings who possess the armor array, the Great Vehicle array, the great path array, and the various arrays of all good qualities, that would not be long enough. However, so that all of you may realize it, and so that sublime beings of the future may achieve the armor array, the Great Vehicle array, the great path array, and the array of the boundless assembly of qualities, I have briefly described it on this occasion.

They mount the Great Vehicle because they wish to conform with all phenomena. They abide on the great path because they wish to conform with all phenomena.

If this armor were unable to discern, resolve, completely understand, conform with, make evident, or transcend all phenomena, it could not rightfully be called donning the great armor.

If designations are made, this is nondesignation, because such designations cannot be apprehended and cannot be seen. There is also no vehicle that can be mounted and dwelt upon; it is through nonapprehension that one abides on the Great Vehicle. Because it abandons proceeding toward a destination, does not reach the ultimate goal, does not arrive at nirvāṇa, and cannot be apprehended, what is not a path is taken as a path. Because one proceeds on the path through sameness, this path of sameness has no designations, for who would make such designations? What would be designated? From where would designations be made? In it there is also no action and no actor. It is not combined, and it is not uncombined. It renounces everything and does not seek anything. Why is this? Because this true path of sameness is not the same as all phenomena, nor is it different from them, nor concurrent with them. It does not produce notions of phenomena—indeed, it abandons phenomena. Therefore, it is neither pure nor impure. The nature of phenomena is also this way—neither pure nor impure. Thus, for this reason this path is called the path without affliction. Because it cannot be traversed, it is traversed. Because it cannot be taken hold of, it is taken up. This path is deeply profound, and therefore it is unborn, unarisen, unemerged, uncreated, unattained, unconditioned, nondwelling, non-abiding, unobscured, and without entity. It can completely reveal all entities, and is indivisible from all entities, yet it does not conform to entities. Because it has no entity, it leads to the unsurpassed abode.

I will eliminate all their forms of weakness, and enrich them with the wealth of discipline, learning, insight, liberation, and the knowledge and view of liberation.

When liberation is attained with this great armor, this vehicle, and this path, there is no combining or not combining, and hence no coming or going, because these cannot be apprehended. Anantamati, this is how bodhisattva great beings proceed via this armor, vehicle, and path. Furthermore, when they proceed with this armor, vehicle, and path, they do not think, ‘I am this near to, or this far from, the qualities of ordinary beings, the qualities of hearers, the qualities of solitary buddhas, or the qualities of the buddhas.’ They do not think, ‘I am this near to, or this far from, the qualities of emptiness, marklessness, wishlessness, birthlessness, or the absence of action.’ They also do not think, ‘I am this near to, or this far from, the qualities of disenchantment,{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-040-002-473}} abandonment, cessation, [F.102.a] and so forth, up to great nirvāṇa.’ Anantamati, because no bodhisattva, hearer, solitary buddha, or being can weaken this great armor, vehicle, or path, they lead to unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening. 
{milestone:{label:1.412,id:UT22084-040-002-474}}“Anantamati, because the blessed buddhas have attained the state that never moves from this armor, vehicle, and path, they have fully passed beyond suffering. Why is this? Because all phenomena are immovable, because the essential nature of phenomena and the characteristic of reality are without any discrepancy, because marks are pure, and because all is pure. There can be no analysis, further analysis, or comprehensive analysis conducted through marks. The marks of all phenomena and the essence of these marks cannot be analyzed, further analyzed, or comprehensively analyzed in terms of their nature. All phenomena are without nature and without marks. They cannot be illustrated, and they cannot be described. This is called the mark of the true nature of all phenomena.
{milestone:{label:1.413,id:UT22084-040-002-475}}“Anantamati, the true marks of this armor, this vehicle, and this path also, in similar fashion, cannot be illustrated or expressed. It is to cause beings to understand, and to increase their knowledge of all phenomena, that this armor, this vehicle, and this path are simply taught as mere designations. If now you wish to engage with and practice according to the true meaning of this armor, then you must not designate, illustrate, or express it as you practice according to the true meaning. [F.102.b] For those who practice according to the true meaning, there is not the slightest thing to engage with or follow. They do not follow what is untrue, but rather follow what is true. When following what is true, one does not follow sound, does not follow words, and does not follow speech. By not following these, one does not engage with them.
{milestone:{label:1.414,id:UT22084-040-002-476}}“In this regard, what is truth? It is the secret teaching. Therefore, once such secret teachings have been understood, they should be practiced with complete trust. Those who practice with complete trust do not conceptualize anything with respect to the truth, and they practice in accord with what is nonconceptual. Those who practice in accord with this do so by not practicing and not following. Why is this? There is not even the slightest thing to practice in such truths, nor is there even the slightest thing to follow or pursue. Because actions are abandoned, one does not follow anything. One does not practice anything that accords with awakening; nor does one practice anything that accords with saṃsāra. In fact, whether one is in accord with something or not, this is not proper mental engagement or correct mindfulness. Because thoughts are pure, thoughts should not be followed.
{milestone:{label:1.415,id:UT22084-040-002-477}}“Anantamati, you should practice in accord with this truth, and you should not have any other practices. If you practice in accord with something else, you will become lost in error, and so you will end up following after sounds, syllables, words, and speech, without ever abandoning such linguistic expressions. When you thoroughly comprehend sounds, transcend syllables and words, and attain realization of linguistic expressions, then you will not follow them, and you will not enter saṃsāra. [F.103.a] In order to practice this way and engage according to this truth, there is not the slightest thing to practice, because all practice has been pacified.
{milestone:{label:1.416,id:UT22084-040-002-478}}“Anantamati, when practicing the truth, do not practice the truth by engaging in practice. If you practice the truth by not practicing, then this is called neither coming nor turning back. To neither come nor turn back is to pursue unsurpassed and perfect awakening in accord with this armor, vehicle, and path, and thereby one will benefit others greatly. Anantamati, those who in this way teach the Dharma, follow the truth, and engage with it will accomplish the great resolve that is free from mental error and doubt. Those who have not yet gathered this armor, this vehicle, and this path will be able to gather them and thus swiftly proceed. Those who have not yet donned the armor will swiftly don it. Those who have not yet mounted this vehicle will swiftly mount it. Those who have not yet begun to abide on this path will swiftly abide on it. Anantamati, such beings will collect vast accumulations of merit. The blessed buddhas will protect them and consider them. Thus, they will not contradict the Dharma, and they will practice in accord with the Saṅgha. Anantamati, because you have collected immeasurable roots of virtue, you must gather beings in the future with this teaching, and bear a great burden on behalf of beings. The extent of the merit you will achieve thereby defies all description.”

He was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, learned and virtuous, a well-gone one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed being, a charioteer who guides beings, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha. [F.116.b] The eon was called Surpassing Excellence, and the world was known as Immaculate. The earth was vast and beautiful, fashioned of the seven precious substances. At that time, the four continents were equal in size, each seventy thousand leagues square. There were sixty thousand cities on each continent, and the size of each city was sixty leagues square. Each city was surrounded by a perimeter fence, which was adorned with turrets. Their gateways were beautiful and lovely to behold. They were surrounded by a ring of the finest palm trees and adorned with many hundreds of thousands of parks. Platforms and seats were situated throughout the parks. They were filled with lakes, ponds, and waterfalls. The paths between them and the steps leading into them were set with various gems. The outlying areas were safe to traverse, and the surrounding moats were lined by rows of various fragrant trees such as sandalwood and tamāla. In each city lived a hundred billion people, all of whom were happy because they had perfected the ten virtuous courses of action. 
{milestone:{label:1.619,id:UT22084-040-002-698}}“The eon was called Surpassing Excellence because the Thus-Gone One had appeared there for a period surpassing two hundred eons. Five hundred thus-gone ones appeared sequentially in that eon, and each of their fields was composed solely of the seven precious substances. After each of those buddhas passed into parinirvāṇa, the genuine Dharma remained in that world for ten thousand years each time. Each of the thus-gone ones that appeared in that world had many assemblies of hearers and bodhisattvas. Within each assembly, countless billions of bodhisattvas, [F.117.a] who had all entered the path of the single vehicle, achieved the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. 
{milestone:{label:1.620,id:UT22084-040-002-699}}“During that eon, there was a universal monarch named Vīrasena, who had the seven precious possessions and ruled over the four continents. In Jambudvīpa at that time, there was a great city sixteen leagues in circumference, within which lived eight hundred billion people. They were happy, joyful, and wealthy, and had extensive resources. This great city was surrounded and adorned by seven rings of moats, seven types of trees aligned in rows, seven thoroughfares, seven flag-bearing towers, seven nets with bells, and one thousand parks, each of which was twenty leagues in size on each side. Each park had seven layers of fences and lattices, and they were beautified with various exquisite decorations and jewels. As such, they resembled the parks of the gods. Each park contained a hundred pools, whose embankments were made of beryl, with steps tiled with emerald and various gems. There were jeweled trees draped with hundreds of garlands of myriad flowers. Within the city was the royal palace, which measured seven leagues in circumference. It was constructed of pure gold and jewels. Its surface was adorned with jewels and draped with nets of beryl and wish-fulfilling gems. It was beautified by palm trees and surrounded by twenty pools. Its grounds were paved with pure gold and covered with gold latticework. Its bridges were studded with beryl and various gems. The paths and stairways were made solely of the finest gold. The pools were filled with blue, red, and white lotuses in bloom.

[F.117.b] One day, as the king was in one of his parks, frolicking and enjoying the five sense pleasures with his retinue, he thought to himself, ‘Sense pleasures are impermanent and quickly decay. Thus, I should surely search for the buddha qualities without any distraction. If I hear the Dharma and practice the teachings correctly, it will bring me lasting benefit and happiness.’ Immediately upon thinking this, a god suddenly appeared in the sky and addressed the king, saying, ‘Sir, this is excellent, excellent! At present, a thus-gone one called All-Illuminating has appeared in the world. He is teaching the Dharma that is virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end. Your Majesty, go swiftly before this thus-gone one and request the genuine Dharma. Thus, Your Majesty, you will receive lasting benefit and happiness. You will also actualize and perfect the buddha qualities.’

I wish to engage in such practice.’ 
{milestone:{label:1.623,id:UT22084-040-002-702}}“When he had asked this question, that thus-gone one explained and taught extensively. Having heard these teachings, the king and his retinue abandoned all their enjoyments and luxuries, and they venerated and served that thus-gone one and his great assembly for twenty thousand years. They took ordination in the teachings of the Thus-Gone One All-Illuminating and practiced the genuine Dharma. [F.118.a] Due to hearing the Dharma, they were able to obtain the virtuous roots of taking up the Dharma, the virtuous roots of upholding the Dharma, and the virtuous roots of teaching the Dharma. Whatever teachings they had heard, they completely remembered without forgetting, and with immeasurable qualities they persevered diligently in cultivation, vowing that ‘We aspire to uphold the genuine Dharma teachings of the thus-gone ones of the three times, and to teach them variously to all beings.’ 
{milestone:{label:1.624,id:UT22084-040-002-703}}“Having made such an aspiration, they served and venerated every thus-gone one who appeared in the Surpassing Excellence eon, and they upheld the genuine Dharma teachings that those thus-gone ones taught in the beginning, middle, and end. Thus, they converted and ripened four hundred trillion beings and set them on course for unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening. They tamed countless beings with skillful means and established them in the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas. The final buddha to appear in that eon was called Flash of Lightning. The monk Vīrasena heard the genuine Dharma from the Thus-Gone One Flash of Lightning and attained the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. 
{milestone:{label:1.625,id:UT22084-040-002-704}}“The Thus-Gone One Flash of Lightning prophesied, ‘Vīrasena, in the future, you will serve and venerate countless thousands of blessed buddhas and uphold the genuine Dharma teachings that they give throughout the three times. You will benefit countless beings, establishing trillions of beings in unsurpassed and perfect awakening, [F.118.b] and countless beings in the vehicle of the hearers. After a countless eon, you will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and be called the Thus-Gone One Victorious King of the Qualities of Boundless Luminous Diligence. Your buddha field will manifest from the countless pure qualities that you will have accumulated. Therefore, it will be filled with people, who will be joyful and prosperous. You will have a large assembly of hearers and bodhisattvas. The lifespan of that thus-gone one will be five lesser eons. Following your parinirvāṇa, your genuine Dharma teachings will remain for one lesser eon,{note:{index:44,id:UT22084-040-002-705}} and they will be upheld by gods and humans.

{milestone:{label:1.626,id:UT22084-040-002-706}}“Therefore, Noble Intellect, bodhisattva great beings should respectfully uphold and cultivate such pure and profound teachings and adorn their bodies with the jewelry of the Dharma. If they are adorned with the Dharma, they will achieve the sturdy and powerful body of a thus-gone one, which is made of vajra. Even if all the beings in the great trichiliocosm were to fight with all their strength to destroy such an extremely sturdy body, they would be unsuccessful. Among all the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras, there will be none who can oppose or contradict their display of the illumination of Dharma. Any being who takes up, reads, recites, or diligently accomplishes this profound teaching will be able to take birth in the high caste of their choice, and so forth, all the way up to taking their seat beneath the tree of awakening. [F.119.a] At that point, they will even reach the level of buddhahood and obtain sublime renown. They will not associate with other paths and, since not even the names of brahmins or non-Buddhists will exist, what need we say about others with negative views and deviant pursuits? Since not even the words nonvirtuous phenomena will exist, how could anyone create roots of nonvirtue? From their fingers and toes, light will stream forth, illuminating immeasurable worlds. Every being whose body it touches will achieve happiness and actualize unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.

{milestone:{label:1.628,id:UT22084-040-002-708}}The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, “Anantamati, those who abide on this bodhisattva path will practice this pure and profound teaching. Then, as they come to accord with emptiness and quiescence, they will attain the illumination of Dharma. Through the power of the illumination of Dharma, they will see the essence of all phenomena to be without difference. Because they have seen that the essence of phenomena is without difference, their view will be pure. Because their view is pure, they will not have views in terms of phenomena, nor will they have views that phenomena are without essential nature. Having purified views about phenomena, there will be no purity, no one who is purified, and no time of purification; and therefore, they will be able to attain the domain of pure wisdom. They will see that the realm of all phenomena is not a realm, nor is it a nonrealm. [F.119.b] Having purified the view of a realm, they will abandon notions of the various natures of different realms. Because they have abandoned notions of any nature, they will be able to realize the secret statements concerning the principle of realms, and will completely understand that various phenomena are not realms. Because in this way they see the realm of phenomena to be indivisible, indestructible, and unchanging, they will become skilled in the principle of the realm of all phenomena. Through such skill, they will be able to completely realize the principle of the realm of phenomena. Through the strength of absorption, they will be able to engage various aspects of the realm of phenomena. When observing such conduct, through their skill regarding all phenomena, they will not abide in or cling to any phenomenon. Because they are without clinging, they will give various teachings that accord with the principle of the realm of all phenomena. Through the power of absorption, they will be able to produce all the forms of concentration, liberation, absorption, and equipoise. They will sport in the supernatural powers, be able to change one into many and many into one, fly freely, and pass through mountains and walls without impediment. They will become skilled in understanding the combinations of the four elements, without abiding in the elements. They will realize that all elements combine with the space element, but will have no clinging or attachment to the element of space. Because they are knowledgeable and skilled in the combination of the elements, they will cultivate all the elements with skillful means. Having cultivated them, they will be able to completely resolve the water element, such that they could cause smoke to rise from the water element, or cause it to burst into flames, or cause smoke [F.120.a] and flames to blaze up within it. Through the process of displaying myriad such things, they will be of great benefit to beings. As they are stable in the skillful means of the principle of the realm of phenomena without any wavering, they will be capable of taking birth within any buddha field, according to their wishes. Thus, they have blocked birth into the womb in all their existences. Rather, assuming an emanated body, they will constantly behold all the thus-gone ones in all the worlds throughout the ten directions. They will know the unique features of those thus-gone ones and be able to identify their name, caste, retinue, and Dharma teachings.” 
{milestone:{label:1.629,id:UT22084-040-002-710}}At that time, there was another bodhisattva great being within the assembly named Boundless Victor, who came forth and asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, in what sort of phenomenon must a bodhisattva great being abide in order to attain these supreme qualities of which the Blessed One has spoken?”
{milestone:{label:1.630,id:UT22084-040-002-711}}The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Boundless Victor, saying, “A bodhisattva great being who does not abide in any phenomenon at all will attain these supreme qualities of which I have spoken. Boundless Victor, if bodhisattva great beings abide in form, feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness; or if they abide in the earth, water, fire, wind, or space elements; or if they abide in the desire, form, or formless realms, [F.120.b] then I do not declare that they will gain such qualities as are taught in this discourse. If bodhisattva great beings do not abide in any phenomenon, neither engaging with nor disengaging from it, I declare that they will attain a boundless ocean of such qualities. Why is this? Because for bodhisattva great beings there are no phenomena at all to apprehend or abide in. Thus, without any engagement with or disengagement from even the slightest phenomenon, they abide in the principle of phenomena without moving. Why is this? It is because, for bodhisattva great beings, there is no abiding and no movement. Since they do not move, for them there is neither high nor low. Because they are without high or low, they abandon the high and do not abide in the low. Because they do not abide, it is said that they dwell in the virtuous abode. Those who dwell in the virtuous abode abide nowhere whatsoever. Abiding nowhere whatsoever, they do not dwell in any abode. Bodhisattva great beings do not establish or accumulate any phenomena. For them there are no abodes, no abiding, no origination, and no action. Why is this? Abodes cannot be apprehended. With no abodes, there is no conceptualization. With no conceptualization, they abide in the realm of phenomena, the unmoving abode. With no abodes, there can be no abiding. Because they have no dwelling in or grasping toward abodes, this is called abiding excellently. 
{milestone:{label:1.631,id:UT22084-040-002-712}}“Boundless Victor, regarding how bodhisattva great beings abide in the principle of phenomena, having determined non-abiding in this way, [F.121.a] they abide in the absence of abodes. Thereby they see all phenomena without conceptualization and abide in nonconceptual conduct. Through such conduct, they see all phenomena to be without movement, and so they are in accord with proper abiding, nonmoving, and nongrasping.”
{milestone:{label:1.632,id:UT22084-040-002-713}}The Blessed One then expressed this in verse:

Blessed One, for those bodhisattva great beings who have been skillfully established in the principle of Dharma, with regard to even the slightest phenomenon, they neither accord nor do not accord with it. They are neither involved nor uninvolved with it. They neither grasp nor do not grasp at it. They neither rely nor do not rely upon it. They neither crave nor abandon craving for it. They neither are angry nor abandon anger at it. Blessed One, even when others respectfully venerate bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in the principle of Dharma, they will not develop attached craving. If others slander or harm them, they will not develop aggression. Since they do not have a variety of notions, and because they have abandoned all views regarding phenomena, they do not apprehend any phenomenon as either associated with or dissociated from any other phenomenon. Thus, because they transcend association and dissociation, they abandon notions of association and dissociation, and they completely understand all notions of association and dissociation. As they transcend such understanding, they do not engage in associating with even the slightest phenomenon, whether advancing, retreating, proceeding somewhere, or proceeding nowhere. [F.122.b] Since they have no deluded ideas concerning the principle of all phenomena, and do not grasp anywhere, they employ skillful means so as not to contradict the nature of phenomena. Blessed One, when bodhisattva great beings observe all phenomena in this fashion, they skillfully reveal the principle of the realm of phenomena, and thus swiftly perfect all the buddha qualities.” 
{milestone:{label:1.657,id:UT22084-040-002-741}}Then the Blessed One addressed the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, saying, “Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings do not establish or abide in the buddha qualities, they see that in the buddha qualities there is no establishment and no place to abide, and they are also without superior abiding or pervasive abiding. Because they see the buddha qualities as abiding without movement, without entering into saṃsāra, and without changing, they abide in accordance with the realm of phenomena. Thus, they are said to be skilled in establishing the principle of the realm of phenomena. Anantamati, with regard to the buddha qualities, bodhisattva great beings do not abide or non-abide in them. They are without superior abiding or pervasive abiding, or abodes or non-abodes. They have no movement, no conceptualization, no superior conceptualization, and no pervasive conceptualization, and thus it is said that they skillfully establish the principle of the realm of all phenomena.

Nor do they see any abode of all phenomena to supremely establish. They are without any conceptualization, superior conceptualization, or pervasive conceptualization, and thus they are said to be skilled in establishing the principle of the realm of all phenomena. Anantamati, bodhisattva great beings do not see any phenomenon to label as abiding or going. They are without any such conceptualization, superior conceptualization, or pervasive conceptualization. They see all phenomena as being pure like space, luminously apparent, and free from afflictions. Because they thus illuminate all phenomena, they are said to have attained the skill in the principle of the realm of all phenomena to observe the realm of phenomena without engaging in establishment. Why is this? Because they do not establish anything whatsoever concerning the realm of phenomena. For example, the elements of space and wind have no abodes; they cannot be seen and cannot be established anywhere. They are not supported anywhere and cannot be pointed out. Likewise, the realm of phenomena has no place of entry, no place that can be seen, no place that can be established, no place that can provide support, nothing that can be understood, and nothing that can be shown. Because bodhisattva great beings have nothing that can be described, they abide in accord with the realm of suchness.

Therefore, it is called the realm of phenomena. Because it is an unchanging realm, it is called the realm of phenomena. [F.123.b] The realm of phenomena pervades all abodes. Anantamati, in the realm of phenomena, there is no going and no destination. Lacking any destination, one is said to abide in accord with the realm of phenomena. There are no abodes in the suchness of the realm of phenomena, nor are there any non-abodes. Why is this? Because the suchness of the realm of phenomena and the nature of suchness are nonexistent.

In order to ripen vast roots of virtue and distinctive accumulations for all beings, and in order to ensure the continuity of the lineage of the Thus-Gone One, they will swiftly proceed to the site of awakening, turn the wheel of Dharma, overpower the abodes of Māra, defeat contrarian teachers, roar the great lion’s roar of sublime beings, teach the sublime Dharma to all beings, correctly liberate them according to their hopes, aspirations, and intentions, and thus cause them all to proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.”

The eon was called Ambrosia, and the world was called Purifying. [F.125.b] The field of that buddha was made of crystal, which constantly radiated light that illuminated the entire world. Any being who was touched by this light became beautiful and lovely in appearance, which is why the world was called Purifying. Apart from this, there were no other names for towns or villages. The intersections were wondrously decorated with golden ropes around the perimeters, and the distance between each intersection was half a league. Between all the roads were rows of eighty-four shining jeweled columns and palm trees. Additionally, there were four pools surrounded by embankments. The people there lived like gods, in mansions made of the seven precious substances, which were draped with nets, hung with silken tassels, and beautified with flowers. The beings of this world were tranquil and happy, having already perfected the path of the ten virtuous actions. They had gorgeous appearances and long lives, with minimal attachment, aggression, and ignorance. They were easy to awaken, and they broadly understood phenomena, with little need for skillful means. This thus-gone one’s lifespan reached a hundred billion years. After his parinirvāṇa, his genuine Dharma teachings remained in the world for ten million years. He taught his assembly the Dharma on ten occasions. In each assembly were twenty trillion hearers on the level of training. The assembly of bodhisattvas was countless, and all engaged in the single vehicle.

Its base was surrounded by a fence and encircled by a ring of beautiful palm trees, which were draped and adorned with nets of golden bells and jewels. His seat of great awakening was three leagues in height, and upon it soft and fine cushions were laid.

Blessed One, if there are no phenomena that can be pursued or relied upon, how could we establish them? Blessed One, we do not see any basis for establishment, whether in the past, present, or future. Blessed One, if there is not any basis for establishment, where could we establish anything?

That thus-gone one then prophesied, ‘After twenty thousand eons, you will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.’ The two bodhisattvas were overjoyed upon hearing that thus-gone one’s prophecy. They directed their minds one-pointedly toward that thus-gone one and entered into states of concentration whereby they achieved mastery over the play of miracles, such as appearing and disappearing freely, and emitting smoke, flames, and light.

True Intellect, to draw an analogy, Mount Meru is made from a variety of jewels; and emerging from the great ocean to stand eighty-four thousand leagues tall, it abides majestically and shines with the most brilliant light. Bodhisattva great beings are also like this—having set out well by means of this absorption, they emerge from the ocean of the storehouse of all phenomena, outshine the entire world of gods and humans, and abide peerlessly, shining with the most brilliant light. Again, just as the full moon is surrounded by stars, so too do bodhisattva great beings stand out amidst all the large worldly assemblies of humans and gods. 
{milestone:{label:1.771,id:UT22084-040-002-866}}“True Intellect, do you see who it is that is not delighted with these teachings, and becomes negligent instead of arousing diligence? It is only those inferior beings with little merit. Any being who has great insight [F.138.b] will be able to accomplish this vast teaching. This vast teaching is replete with all the qualities that sublime beings must gather. As I have taught, those who can gather this vast wealth of Dharma will be guarded by gods and humans, and cared for by the buddhas and bodhisattva great beings of the ten directions.”
{milestone:{label:1.772,id:UT22084-040-002-867}}Then the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, “Anantamati, those bodhisattva great beings who earnestly practice and train in this Dharma teaching will greatly benefit others, sever all doubts, release all ties, discard all habitual tendencies, sever all latent tendencies, transcend all desirous craving, cross the ocean of all realms of existence, dispel all darkness, eliminate all fear and anxiety, and swiftly understand the minds of all beings with skillful means.”
{milestone:{label:1.773,id:UT22084-040-002-868}}Once the Blessed One had said this, he emitted a great light that illuminated countless worlds and eclipsed all the light of the sun and moon. After emitting this light, he again addressed the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, “Anantamati, those bodhisattva great beings who earnestly accomplish this absorption of the oceanic seal will display great miracles and emit great light just like this, and will properly deliver this Dharma teaching by roaring the great lion’s roar. [F.139.a] In this way, they will transcend the three realms and produce great illumination. It will be no different from what I have done today.”
{milestone:{label:1.774,id:UT22084-040-002-869}}Then the bodhisattva great being Anantamati supplicated the Blessed One, saying, “Blessed One, may the Thus-Gone One please bless this Dharma teaching, so that in latter times, merely hearing the name of this Dharma teaching will be sufficient for beings to achieve boundless qualities.”
{milestone:{label:1.775,id:UT22084-040-002-870}}The Blessed One then emitted a great flash of light to bless this Dharma teaching. Additionally, with a single finger he stirred all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm, whereby beings achieved great bliss. At that moment, all the gathered assemblies of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas tossed sublime, divine flowers and fine garments and played their divine instruments at the same time. Countless gods holding divine garments shook them by their edges, so that their fanning and fluttering filled the sky. With one voice they declared, “Amazing, amazing! The domain of the buddhas is inconceivable. Know that anyone who retains this profound teaching is worthy of respectful veneration and honor by all beings.”
{milestone:{label:1.776,id:UT22084-040-002-871}}The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, “Anantamati, in the future, beings who have little merit will not hear about this array of armor and this array of absorptions. However, in the future, beings who are skillful and have gathered great accumulations will hear this teaching. [F.139.b] Those who earnestly practice this teaching will be accepted by the blessed buddhas of the three times. Anantamati, for future times, when great terrors emerge, I entrust this Dharma teaching of mine to all of you. You have now attained the abundant qualities and boundless happiness that I attained by amassing the unsurpassed treasury of Dharma over countless billions of eons. You have now abandoned all the aggregates of suffering. With a boundless ocean of qualities, you will swiftly proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.”
{milestone:{label:1.777,id:UT22084-040-002-872}}Then the bodhisattva great being Anantamati prostrated at the Blessed One’s feet, together with five hundred bodhisattva great beings and all the householders headed by the merchant Bhadrapāla, and said, “Blessed One, we will uphold the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma of great awakening according to our abilities, so that in the final period we can bring great benefit to beings.”
{milestone:{label:1.778,id:UT22084-040-002-873}}The bodhisattva great beings then rose from their seats, scattered myriad flowers toward the Thus-Gone One, and removed their finer upper garments and offered them. They said, “Blessed One, we dedicate this root of virtue to all beings, praying that beings will attain all the factors of awakening and actualize the Thus-Gone One’s omniscient insight, and that in the future, the roots of virtue of all beings will be perfected.” [F.140.a]
{milestone:{label:1.779,id:UT22084-040-002-874}}Then, to delight the bodhisattva great beings, the Blessed One spoke the following verses:
“In order to bring great benefit
To all beings,
You should uphold the Dharma of my awakening,
And roar the lion’s roar of the Dharma King.
{milestone:{label:1.780,id:UT22084-040-002-876}}“In the final period in the future,
Anyone seeking the Dharma
Who hears this vast teaching
Will achieve happiness.
{milestone:{label:1.781,id:UT22084-040-002-877}}“Just as I have taught, 
Anyone who sees this vehicle
And hears the Dharma taught in this discourse 
Will achieve the happiness they aim for.
{milestone:{label:1.782,id:UT22084-040-002-878}}“When wise persons,
Who have cultivated skillful means,
Hear this supreme teaching,
They will find physical and mental happiness.
{milestone:{label:1.783,id:UT22084-040-002-879}}“Those gathered in this assembly,
Who have seen me teach in person
And heard this Dharma,
Will become tremendously inspired by this.
{milestone:{label:1.784,id:UT22084-040-002-880}}“During the final period in the future,
You will produce a great mass of merit
That is incalculable, immeasurable,
Vast, and boundless. 
{milestone:{label:1.785,id:UT22084-040-002-881}}“In the final age of the future, 
Those who retain this teaching,
Spoken by the Dharma Lord,
Will be cared for by the buddhas.
{milestone:{label:1.786,id:UT22084-040-002-882}}“Those who retain my Dharma of awakening
During the final age of the future
Will be the final recipients of the Dharma
Of immeasurable buddhas.”
{milestone:{label:1.787,id:UT22084-040-002-883}}When the Blessed One taught this Dharma, countless bodhisattvas gained the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Countless beings ripened their roots of virtue. When the Blessed One had so taught, the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, along with the other bodhisattva great beings and the world with its gods, humans, and asuras rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said.
{milestone:{label:1.788,id:UT22084-040-002-884}}This concludes The Teaching of the Armor Array, the seventh of the one hundred thousand sections of the Dharma discourse known as The Noble Great Heap of Jewels.
