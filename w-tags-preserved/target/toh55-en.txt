That marquee was very tall and wide, and it covered the whole area. It was decorated with symmetrical golden nets, garlands of precious gems, and lion standards, as well as a billion interwoven golden threads. Heaps of garlands of precious flowers in the most magnificent colors were spread on the floor, and innumerable garlands of other flowers, such as magnolia and rosewood flowers, were hung as ornaments, covering the entire interior of the precious marquee as well as the entire assembly.

Many asuras and gods were also present in the sky, sheltering the Thus-Gone One by holding bejeweled parasols adorned with gold and silver above his head. Through his miraculous powers, the Blessed One manifested countless hundreds of thousands of sandalwood trees, [F.226.b] golden trees, and trees filled with jeweled vessels and cloths. Those trees were adorned with precious gems and with magnificent blooming flowers and leaves; they all manifested as the result of the collective karmic ripening of countless beings’ merit. Whenever the wind blew, the fragrance of their sublime perfumes pervaded innumerable buddha realms. Countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings also held up flowers at the same time and tossed them upon the Blessed One.
