The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
The Teaching on the Effulgence of Light
$1.1 [F.195.b] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!#8
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Rājagṛha at Vulture Peak, together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks who had all attained great independence, eight hundred billion bodhisattva great beings with only one birth remaining and led by Maitreya, and four hundred billion bodhisattva great beings led by Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta.
$1.2 Present in the retinue at that time was Candraprabhakumārabhūta.#9 He had been seated in the assembly, but he now rose from his seat, arranged his shawl over one shoulder,#10 knelt on his right knee, and prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One. With his palms respectfully joined together, he asked, “Blessed One, which activities did the Thus-Gone One previously perform to achieve his definitive light, magnetizing light, motivating light, manifesting light, multicolored light, single-colored light, narrow light, vast light, pure light, utterly pure light, stainless light, utterly stainless light, immaculate light, gradually expanding light, bright light, utterly bright light, boundless light, utterly boundless light, [F.196.a] immeasurable light, utterly immeasurable light, unfathomable light, utterly unfathomable light, swift light, utterly swift light, nonabiding light, groundless light, blazing light, illuminating light, inspiring light, light that leads to perfection, unimpeded light, unwavering light, straight light, light that dwells within the infinite, light displaying the marks of form, light displaying the various marks of form, light displaying the immeasurable marks of form, light displaying the characteristics of blue, yellow, red, and white colors, light displaying the characteristics of violet color, light displaying the characteristics of crystalline color, light displaying the characteristics of the sky’s color,#11 and other such lights?

That water is impermanent,
And that fire is empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.452 “Blessed One, you realize that air is selfless,
Essences are impermanent,
And material things are empty. 
Why do you smile?
$1.453 “Blessed One, you realize that the world is selfless,
That suffering is impermanent,
And that the aggregates are empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.454 “Blessed One, you realize that the elements are selfless,
That the world is impermanent,
And that arising is empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.455 “Blessed One, you realize that sounds are selfless,
That names are impermanent,
And that the path is empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.456 “Blessed One, you realize that wisdom is selfless,
That disengagement is impermanent,
And that sentient beings are empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.457 “Blessed One, you realize that any nature lacks inherent nature,
That the self is devoid of self,
And that inclinations are empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.458 “You see that saṃsāra is selfless,
You know what is permanent and impermanent,
And you realize that nirvāṇa is empty.
Why do you smile?
$1.459 “Thus-Gone One, your mind is free,
Your renown pervades the entirety of the three realms,
And you are worshiped by all beings, 
Such as Śakra, the rulers of human beings, and nāgas.
$1.460 “The Thus-Gone One realizes
That the limits of the exhaustion 
And arising of the eye are void. 
Why does he smile?
$1.461 “All the countless heirs of the buddhas
Have gathered in this retinue.
They were born from the Buddha’s speech
And emanated from the Dharma.
$1.462 “They have come into the presence of the Blessed One
And respectfully join their palms.
For those who have gathered in this assembly,
I ask you to declare the causes and conditions of this light. [F.218.b]
$1.463 “Since the Thus-Gone One realizes
That the eye is empty and selfless,
He truly surpasses
All householder practitioners. 
$1.464 “The Thus-Gone One knows
The lack of difference and the sameness of phenomena.
Blessed One, you know this through your insight—#128
You do not perceive this through your miraculous powers.
$1.465 “Blessed One, you realize that the eye is selfless,
That its essence is empty, and that it does not come from or go anywhere—
Your immaculate wisdom is immeasurable.
Why do you smile? 
$1.466 “Thus-Gone One, your births are totally exhausted, 
And you protect all the worlds through your great compassion.
Dharma lord, supreme leader of human beings,
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.467 “Countless great bodhisattvas
And hosts of majestic gods
Are holding sublime parasols in the sky,
And this great earth has shaken.
$1.468 “You bring delight impartially to those 
Who have accomplished virtuous qualities 
For a long time under the thus-gone ones of the past.
Great compassionate leader, please tell us why you smile! 
$1.469 “Those who have worshiped buddhas in the past
Are filled with joy when they hear this teaching.
Great guide, supreme leader of human beings, 
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.470 “Blessed One, you please beings through your manifold teachings,
Your melodious voice resembles the songs of the swan—the king of birds—#129
And countless delightful words manifest spontaneously from your mouth.
Please tell us why you emitted light!
$1.471 “The praises of your agreeable speech are proclaimed
In countless millions of verses,
And you are endowed with the supreme voice of the black Indian cuckoo.#130
Please tell us why you emitted light!
$1.472 “The deep thunder roar by which you teach the Dharma
Resounds throughout countless hundreds of thousands of worlds.
Through your compassion you teach using both harsh and sweet words.
Why did you emit golden light?
$1.473 “You understand arising, non-arising, exhaustion, and non-exhaustion,
And you realize that the eye is absent and beyond coming and going.
Illuminator of the world, supreme ambrosia,#131
Why did you emit golden light? [F.219.a]
$1.474 “You realize that the occurrence of the eye
Is always empty and void, beyond coming and going, 
And groundless, like a mirage or a water bubble.
What are the causes and conditions of your smile?
$1.475 “Know that the same applies
To the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, textures, and mental phenomena,
Up to words, names, and so forth. 
$1.476 “Your body is permanent like vajra and indestructible. 
It is endowed with a hundred thousand perfect and supreme marks,
And you move your body without any fetters.
Please tell us—what are the causes and conditions of your smile?
$1.477 “Your calves are round,#132 your heels are broad,
And like a lion your abdomen does not bulge—
Your navel is deep, and your waist is broad.
Please tell us—what are the causes and conditions of your smile?
$1.478 “Your golden body is pure, stainless, and immaculate,
And each hair on your body is deep black,
Perfumed, and curls to the right.
Please tell us—what are the causes and conditions of your smile?
$1.479 “Your sublime body, perfect and permanently enduring,
Is like the king of trees, the banyan fig.
It is adorned with all qualities,
And your melodious voice pleases your retinues.
$1.480 “Your shoulders are round, your upper arms are thick and beautiful,#133
Your crown protuberance is perfect and coiled clockwise,
You move throughout countless hundreds of thousands of realms,
And you point out to sentient beings the mistaken and the correct paths. 
$1.481 “Your teeth are white and spotless like conch shells,#134
Your tongue is long and can cover your whole face,
Your cheeks resemble the jaws of a lion, and your nose is prominent.#135
All those qualities arise from your skill and your pure mind.
$1.482 “The fragrance of blue lotus flowers exudes from your mouth,
And your body is pervaded by the scent of sandalwood.
Since you have cultivated love extensively in the past,
Your pure intent is uninterrupted.
$1.483 “Thus-Gone One, the soles of your feet are even,
And although they touch the ground, they remain unsullied by dust.#136
Walking like a lion and an elephant,
You have transcended the entire world.
$1.484 “You are beautified by the marks of thousand-spoked wheels,
And your sublime light shines brilliantly.
Since you benefit beings through your virtue, [F.219.b]
Whoever sees you is filled with faith.
$1.485 “Each of your fingers emits a hundred thousand light rays
That illuminate countless buddha realms.
Since you have accomplished so many virtuous practices in the past,
You have achieved those various arrays of excellent marks.
$1.486 “Your form body is perfect and unequaled,
The marks that beautify your face are magnificent,
And you benefit the world#137 through your miraculous powers.
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.487 “Your calves are similar to the calves of antelope,
And the shape of your body resembles that of a lion.#138
You appear within the worlds and illuminate them.#139
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.488 “Like a stallion,#140 your genitals are hidden and stainless; 
The palms of your hands are even and broad, 
And your arms reach past your knees.
Amazing and magnificent lion of human beings, please tell us why you smile!
$1.489 “Innumerable brilliant, soothing, and brightly colored light rays 
Radiate from your body.#141
Your pure mind is uninterrupted,
And you reveal countless discourses.
$1.490 “Such qualities will not be accomplished
By those who uphold eternalist or nihilist views.
Only those who have abandoned extreme views
Will swiftly attain the pure body of the blessed ones.#142
$1.491 “Your speech resounds like divine drums and roaring thunder;
It is melodious and clear like the songs of the kalandaka bird#143
And endowed with a hundred thousand tunes of divine songs.
Please tell us why you emitted lights!
$1.492 “Great Guide, by teaching the Dharma through a single teaching, 
You interrupt the practices of those who adhere to improper discipline.
Whatever melodious words come from the Thus-Gone One’s mouth
Are profound and amazing!
$1.493 “Leader of human beings, the light rays emitted from between your eyebrows
Illuminate a hundred thousand buddha realms,
Your sublime eyes have a deep black color,
And the mark of your crown protuberance cannot be seen by the celestial gods.
$1.494 “Your forty teeth,
White like crystal,#144
Are the manifestation of your immeasurable virtuous activities.
Please tell us why you smile! [F.220.a]
$1.495 “Thus-Gone One, your body of perfect qualities
Shines with countless excellent and magnificent colors
And emits the most amazing pure light rays.
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.496 “Great compassionate one, supreme victor, leader of human beings,
You know the pure intentions of sentient beings,
And you have achieved supreme, unimpeded eloquence.
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.497 “Since the Thus-Gone One has reached the other shore,
He is perfectly endowed with the three knowledges and the six higher perceptions,
And he displays innumerable pure light rays.
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.498 “Blessed One, during countless eons in the past,
You worshiped a hundred thousand blessed ones,
And the fruition of such causes is inexhaustible.
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.499 “Blessed One, since for countless eons in the past 
You have dwelled within supreme states of absorption,
You have realized the limits of the arising and exhaustion of the eye.
Please tell us why you smile!
$1.500 “Great guide, you clearly know
The past, the future, and the present—
Your immaculate wisdom is unimpeded and inconceivable,
Please tell us why you smile!”
$1.501 At that moment, in front of the numerous retinues, the Blessed One extended his golden hand, placed it on Candraprabhakumārabhūta’s head, and spoke these verses:
$1.502 “Kumāra, listen carefully!
I now entrust to you
This teaching on awakening—
The sūtra on the manifestation of lights.
$1.503 “In the future, during the final period
Of the degenerate times,
When the Dharma is about to vanish,
You must reveal it and expound it to sentient beings!
$1.504 “With my buddha eye, I see and know
All those who, in the future, during the final period,#145
Will be interested in this excellent, profound, and sacred sūtra,
As well as all those who will not be interested in it.
$1.505 “Sentient beings who pursue 
The path of awakening 
Should constantly recollect the Buddha
And keep this discourse in mind.
$1.506 “Those whose faith has disappeared,
Who are attracted to distraction,
And who delight in sleeping both day and night
Will not be interested in this discourse. [F.220.b]
$1.507 “Even if they become renunciants
Under my teachings,
Interest in the qualities of nirvāṇa
Will not arise in them.
$1.508 “Those fools will squander the gifts of faith, 
And even if they hear repeatedly 
About the defects associated with conditioned phenomena,
They will cling to worldly concerns, and fear will not arise in them.
$1.509 “Those fools
Will deprecate the wise ones,
And even if they wear the Dharma robes,
They will be devoid of even the slightest trace of insight.
$1.510 “Since they will not know the true words
Well-spoken by the Sage,
And even if they hear them, they will not believe in them,
Do not stay in the company of such fools!
$1.511 “Even if they hear these magnificent teachings,
Joy and devotion will not arise in their minds.
I reproach such individuals;
Though they have a human body, they waste it in meaningless pursuits.
$1.512 “Those whose minds become filled with joy and devotion
When they hear these profound teachings
Have already met buddhas in the past.
There is thus no doubt that they will reach unsurpassed awakening.
$1.513 “Fools who are inferior due to their unwholesome views
And sever the life force of insight will forsake awakening;
Therefore, abandon such nonvirtuous friends
And instead attend to the wise ones and revere them!
$1.514 “All the innumerable defects in all the worlds,
And all sentient beings sinking in the three lower realms,
Originate from the causes and conditions of ignorance and delusion;
Therefore, those who follow their afflictions will not gain freedom.
$1.515 “Since they forsake the true Dharma
And practice what is contrary to the Dharma,
You should abandon 
Those inferior, deluded beings!
$1.516 “Like a charioteer#146 breaking 
The axle of his steering wheels,
Sentient beings who engage in nonvirtuous actions
Will be reborn in the hell realms.
$1.517 “Abusive words always come back to harm
Those who pronounce them, [F.221.a]
Just like a sharp axe that strikes the body 
Of the one who wields it.
$1.518 “Karmic ripening is experienced without fail,
In accordance with the causes and conditions of the actions performed.#147
Those who do not understand this will attend to worldly sages,
Thinking they are virtuous friends.
$1.519 “Then, thinking that those who meditate on emptiness
Realize the unconditioned, they will develop nihilist views;
They will say that the body becomes like a broken pot
And that the mind also ceases to be.
$1.520 “They will mostly be drawn
To idle gossip,#148
And, strongly attached to it,
They will gain no benefits whatsoever.
$1.521 “The harm caused by poisonous snakes
Will never cause many beings to fall into the lower realms,
But when a fool teaches the Dharma he destroys roots of virtue,
Which causes countless beings to fall into the hell realms.
$1.522 “You who have gathered in this assembly should consider
That Candraprabhakumāra, who is present here today,
Has worshiped and venerated countless blessed buddhas in the past—
As many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
$1.523 “Since he has pursued unsurpassed wisdom
By meditating in a steadfast manner,
His mind does not dwell
On any of the realms of existence.
$1.524 “Since he knows that the limit of the arising of the eye
Is always pure,
He has abandoned concepts,
And he is utterly free from clinging.
$1.525 “He will teach this unsurpassed sūtra
On the manifestation of lights
In order to benefit
Countless sentient beings. 
$1.526 “Since fools are unable to train in this teaching,
They regard genuine spiritual practices as faulty.#149
Therefore, stay far away from such fools;
Do not assist them, and do not train in their teachings!
$1.527 “Since fools are attracted to dispute,
They are unable to earnestly adopt behavior that is free from conflict.
Such beings are utterly devoid of an appropriate mindset,
So do not serve them or proclaim their praise! [F.221.b]
$1.528 “Since fools are lazy and indolent by nature, 
They constantly engage in physical, verbal, and mental nonvirtuous actions;
They therefore completely lack
Pure discipline, insight, and erudition.
$1.529 “They always think about the objects of their desires,
And they are drawn to distractions;
Regard the families, blood lines, 
And bodies of such fools as inferior!
$1.530 “They are filled with aggression, they do not listen to advice,
And their faces are repulsive;
Even if they are born in virtuous locations,
Their bodies will be vile.
$1.531 “Since they cling to the notion of self, they are deluded about the true meaning.
Since they lack intelligence, they are unable to understand the diversity of words.
Even if they hear teachings about intrinsic emptiness,
They are not interested in them.
$1.532 “The thus-gone ones, the blessed ones
Have long ago abandoned all worldly verbal constructs.
Ordinary beings cling and are attached to those,
And so, for as long as they live, they fail to gain understanding and realization.
$1.533 “Though they might proclaim the praises of discipline,
They do not practice pure conduct.
Though their mouths might teach the Dharma,
Their bodies engage in practices that are contrary to it.
$1.534 “Though they might teach the Vinaya,
They always behave in ways that are contrary to it.
The Buddha has instructed his disciples
To wear the saffron-colored robes.
$1.535 “Still, even if those who observe improper discipline
Put on such robes,
It only causes the strength of pride and carelessness
To grow in their minds.#150
$1.536 “When they eat the food that is donated to them with faith, 
It is like swallowing burning iron.
In that way, after renouncing their households,
They do not experience sense pleasures,
$1.537 “Nor do they gain the supreme happiness 
Associated with the Dharma of the buddhas.
In this way, they aspire for a variety of experiences
And do not abandon the two extremes.
$1.538 “None of their interests are pure,
And even when such fools are in a large retinue,
They are like foxes
That have entered a pack of lions.
$1.539 “Even if you give
Teachings related to peace,
They do not understand or realize
The meaning of suchness and emptiness. 
$1.540 “Even if their teachings are praised in large retinues, [F.222.a]
This only causes their arrogance to increase;
Since they do not recollect the great teacher,
They lack modesty and humility.#151
$1.541 “Even when they take hold of impure objects,
They joyfully hold on to them
As if they were wish-fulfilling gems,
And their minds never let go of them.
$1.542 “Though such vile beings 
Might renounce their households,
Guard their behavior, put on Dharma robes, 
And carry alms bowls,
$1.543 “These are all merely superficial displays,
And so they utterly lack true insight.
Even if they shave their facial hairs,
They do not renounce harmful attitudes.
$1.544 “Since they follow teachings contrary to virtuous practice 
And fall into mistaken views,
The path leading to disengagement and nirvāṇa
Is completely ruined for them.#152
$1.545 “They will not achieve the fruition
Resulting from engaging in virtuous practice,
And so their ignorance and other afflictions
Will not diminish in the slightest.
$1.546 “While roaming in the cities, 
They sing the praise of disengagement.
Due to their lack of intelligence, 
Those fools do not understand the genuine path. 
$1.547 “All their aspirations are nonvirtuous;
Even if they stay in the wilderness,
It is not to accomplish the true causes of nirvāṇa,
But out of desire for personal gain.
$1.548 “Fond of drowsiness and sleep,
They are concerned about their physical well-being
And constantly long 
For ways to accomplish that goal.
$1.549 “Even if they stay in the wilderness for many years,
They adhere to mistaken views,
And so they stray from the path leading to nirvāṇa,
Never obtaining the results of the paths of virtuous practice.
$1.550 “Since they regress from the genuine view#153
And transgress pure discipline,
They always crave fine clothes to adorn their bodies,
And for the happiness of sensual pleasures.
$1.551 “When they enter cities,
They bear the marks of pride 
And do not guard their physical actions,
And so they do not observe pure conduct.
$1.552 “At times, when they enter cities and roam about,
They boast about their characteristics in these words: 
‘You should know that the caves in the wilderness are my home. [F.222.b]
My eyes downcast, I glance upward slowly, walking and stopping serenely.’
$1.553 “Since they do indeed look like worthy ones,
All the householders say to one another,
‘This monk who stays in the wilderness
Is truly a noble being!’
$1.554 “At other times, when visitors come to see them 
While they stay in the forest, they brag in words such as these:
‘In these jungles I wander day and night’
Or ‘This mat of fresh grass is where I sit.’
$1.555 “At other times, when they go to cities and enter homes,
They eagerly ask with deception, ‘Are you well?’ 
Before engaging in frivolous mundane conversations
Related to various topics such as kings and thieves.
$1.556 “At other times, driven by attachment,
They boast about their own qualities
In various ways
In the presence of women.
$1.557 “They say, ‘I am a great field of merit for the entire world;
I have renounced my kingdom and become a renunciant,
And now I meditate on the path.
My queen and my children#154 have been reborn in the higher realms.’
$1.558 “Upon hearing those words,
The women are filled with immense respect;
They collect clothes, food, and beverages, which they offer with the words, 
‘Venerable, look upon us with compassion—please come to us directly!’#155
$1.559 “Since such people are attached to delicious meals 
And do not know their defects,
They are at the mercy of Māra,
Like turtles caught in nets. 
$1.560 “Even while staying in the wilderness,
They are conceited about their achievements,
And they continue to despise and deprecate
Those monks who are diligent.
$1.561 “Since they repeatedly give rise to attachment
Out of the delusion related to gain and fame,
And since they constantly engage in deceitful actions to sustain themselves,
They repeatedly increase their physical and verbal unwholesome actions.
$1.562 “Even if benefactors make offerings to them out of faith,
Their merit will decrease through the power of their laziness. [F.223.a]
Since those fools always long for nonvirtue,
They will never reach the acceptance that accords with emptiness.
$1.563 “For those who completely abandon those faults
On the basis of my teachings
And practice with zeal and conscientiousness,
It will not be difficult to hear#156 this teaching.
$1.564 “For those who are unshaken by worldly concerns
Such as gain, loss, praise, criticism,
Suffering, and happiness,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
$1.565 “For those who perceive the body as filth,
The aggregates as wounds,
And food as poison for the wounds,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
$1.566 “For those who do not become haughty
But put on the attire of modesty
Even when they receive fine clothes,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching. 
$1.567 “For those who are not conceited about their appearance and strength,
Who are not attached to food
But merely eat to sustain their lives,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
$1.568 “For those who know that the objects of craving are empty
And therefore neither indulge in nor reject pleasures
But always act with the understanding of emptiness and disengagement,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
$1.569 “For those living alone in the mountains—more than a league away—
Who, while absorbed in equipoise, 
Realize the selflessness of conditioned phenomena,
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
$1.570 “For those who accomplish the path of the pure eye
By realizing the characteristics of the limits 
Of the exhaustion, arising, and cognition of the eye, 
It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.
$1.571 “The same also applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures, 
Up to words and names.
$1.572 “You should know that,
In the future,
All the countless monks will be 
Either diligent or lazy in those ways.
$1.573 “You should know that, in those ways, 
They will either be virtuous or nonvirtuous friends,
Accomplished or unaccomplished,
Trusting or untrusting.
$1.574 “You should know that, in those ways, they will be
Either virtuous or nonvirtuous friends
Who accomplish or do not accomplish
The path of the eye’s exhaustion.#157
$1.575 “You should know that, in those ways, 
Some will be strongly interested in awakening,
Only to lose interest later,
After one, two, or three months have passed.
$1.576 “Still, even if the interest 
Born upon hearing this teaching [F.223.b]
Declines in some,
They will revive their faith later on.
$1.577 “Some will not abandon their carelessness
When they hear this teaching;
Instead, they will think,
‘This discourse is not the Buddha’s words!’
$1.578 “After hearing this teaching, 
Some will be caught by Māra;
Even if faith has initially arisen in them,
They will abandon it later on. 
$1.579 “Those who are not interested in the Dharma will pursue falsehood, fame, and gain;
Although they might sing the praises of the lights 
Of dhāraṇīs, absorption, and complete comprehension 
As they roam through cities and towns, they will not gain true realization.
$1.580 “Those who are bound by the five sense pleasures
And pursue worldly activities
Will involve themselves in concepts and statements,#158
And so denigrate the training in emptiness.
$1.581 “Devoid of mindfulness and insight,
Their whole life will be wasted in meaningless pursuits;
The fools who abandon the Dharma of emptiness obstruct their discipline,#159
And so fall into the Hell of Unceasing Torment, never to be reborn in the higher realms.
$1.582 “Someone who hears this discourse 
And memorizes a single four-line verse from it
Is more exalted than someone who builds
A thousand stūpas in every single moment.
$1.583 “Someone who hears this discourse 
And memorizes#160 a single four-line verse from it
Is more exalted than someone who offers
A hundred thousand flower garlands to the stūpas of the buddhas.
$1.584 “Someone who contemplates this discourse
For just a single moment 
Is more exalted than someone who builds 
As many bejeweled stūpas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
$1.585 “Someone who contemplates this discourse
For just a single moment 
Is more exalted than someone who venerates 
Ten million buddha realms by tossing flowers.
$1.586 “Someone who contemplates this discourse
For just a single moment 
Is more exalted than someone who offers 
Ten million Dharma robes to the buddhas.
$1.587 “The buddha eye is pure and superior—
There is nothing that it does not know and see.
Those who are dedicated to this discourse
Will achieve the buddha eye. 
$1.588 “Countless eons ago, 
The Buddha Dīpaṅkara appeared.
I was at that time the child of a brahmin,#161
And I worshiped him by holding up flowers.
$1.589 “He prophesied that I would become a buddha 
Named Śākyamuni,
And that I would teach this discourse
While sitting at the seat of awakening. 
$1.590 “You were a young boy at that time.
When you heard this prophecy,
You became overjoyed and filled with faith. [F.224.a]
With your palms joined, you made this aspiration:
$1.591 “ ‘When this brahmin child becomes a perfect buddha,
May I become his assistant.
After he passes into nirvāṇa,
May I uphold and guard his collection of teachings!’
$1.592 “When the Buddha Dīpaṅkara
Taught this discourse on the manifestation of lights,
Both the brahmin son and the young boy
Listened to it carefully and kept it in mind.
$1.593 “In the past, I once offered blue lotus flowers to that buddha.
You were present at that time, and you made the aspiration
To uphold this discourse during the final period of my teachings
And to propagate it on a vast scale.
$1.594 “Those who, upon hearing this teaching,
Do not give rise to aversion but hold it,
Keep it in mind, read it, and recite it
Are sublime beings!
$1.595 “In the future, you should uphold
This teaching that is difficult to hear,
Teach it extensively, and reveal its meaning
To sentient beings!
$1.596 “In the past, 
When the true Dharma was about to disappear,
I also taught this discourse on the manifestation of lights 
Extensively to sentient beings.
$1.597 “Because fools do not accomplish it with determination, 
They deprecate it.
Still, when I hear their words, 
I do not become angry.
$1.598 “Instead, I always cultivate patience 
And benefit the world.
Since the strength of my patience is perfect, 
I am adorned with the major and minor marks.
$1.599 “Kumāra, you should regard the excellent
And perfect body of the Buddha, 
As well as his pure and sublime golden color, 
As the outcome of the strength of his patience.
$1.600 “Countless realms shake
When my feet touch the earth,
Yet no sentient being loses balance;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my patience.
$1.601 “The hundred thousand light rays
Emitted from each pore of my hair
Illuminate all directions;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
$1.602 “Creatures with frightening appearances such as rākṣasas,
As well as ravishing and majestic beings,#162
All show reverence to me;#163
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
$1.603 “All the members of my retinues
Have developed gentle minds,
And they revere the Thus-Gone One;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
$1.604 “All the praises of the Buddha’s qualities 
Proclaimed within my great assemblies
With a hundred thousand musical tunes, [F.224.b]
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
$1.605 “A hundred thousand malevolent 
And frightening nāga kings
Become pleased when they see the Buddha;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.
$1.606 “Beings such as rākṣasas and yakṣas
Come to me carrying hundreds of thousands
Of flower garlands to worship me;
All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.

$1.631 When he heard this unique and extraordinary teaching, Candraprabhakumārabhūta was overjoyed. With his palms joined, he said, “Blessed One, if I were to invite the Thus-Gone One and his large retinue for lunch tomorrow, would he consider me with affection and consent to come for the lunch that I will prepare?”#171
$1.632 As he said this, the Blessed One perceived Kumāra’s pure motivation, [F.225.b] and he knew that this would benefit countless sentient beings. So, considering him with affection, he gave his consent by not responding. Candraprabhakumārabhūta then stood up, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and, filled with joy, went back to his home. Together with his retinue, and with the help of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, mahoragas,#172 and other beings, he installed a silken marquee at a crossroads near the city of Rājagṛha. That marquee was very tall and wide, and it covered the whole area. It was decorated with symmetrical golden nets, garlands of precious gems, and lion standards, as well as a billion interwoven golden threads. Heaps of garlands of precious flowers in the most magnificent colors were spread on the floor, and innumerable garlands of other flowers, such as magnolia and rosewood flowers, were hung as ornaments, covering the entire interior of the precious marquee as well as the entire assembly. A throne and seats were arranged inside, and a variety of pure and delightful precious fragrant substances, such as pṛkkā,#173 dumaca,#174 sandalwood, and saffron, were burned. Different kinds of the most excellent mixed incenses were also prepared as offering substances. Fragrant water was sprinkled in all the lanes of the city, and fresh flowers were spread all over the ground. At that time, innumerable goddesses, female asuras, and daughters of Rāhula#175 were thrilled and came with the desire to accomplish the cause of awakening, adorning that magnificent great city with their presence.
$1.633 Once Candraprabhakumārabhūta knew that the entire city had been cleaned and decorated and it was time for the noon meal, he addressed the Blessed One, [F.226.a] “Blessed One, please come to this city in order to heal#176 sentient beings!”
$1.634 The Blessed One arrived at the city with his many retinues, and as soon as he stepped through the city gate, the ground of that great city and countless billions of universes in the ten directions began to shake. At that moment, those who were blind could see, those who were suffering became happy, those who were deaf could hear, those who were ugly became handsome, those who were poor became wealthy, those who were childless had children, those who had no clothes received clothes, those who had no jewels received jewels, those who had no friends gained friends, and those who had no physical ornaments received all kinds of physical ornaments. Upon seeing the Thus-Gone One, many groups of birds such as swans, cranes, parrots, peacocks, and crows became overjoyed and started to sing the most pleasant and sublime songs, which brought immense delight to those who heard them. 
$1.635 Miraculously, the Thus-Gone One also emanated countless magnolia trees, and many hundreds of thousands of sentient beings worshiped the Blessed One by proffering fresh flowers as well as the most fragrant perfumes and strewing them upon him. Many hundreds of thousands of mighty female asuras carried red pearls and sandalwood powders, which they joyfully tossed at the Thus-Gone One. Many asuras and gods were also present in the sky, sheltering the Thus-Gone One by holding bejeweled parasols adorned with gold and silver above his head. Through his miraculous powers, the Blessed One manifested countless hundreds of thousands of sandalwood trees, [F.226.b] golden trees, and trees filled with jeweled vessels and cloths. Those trees were adorned with precious gems and with magnificent blooming flowers and leaves; they all manifested as the result of the collective karmic ripening of countless beings’ merit. Whenever the wind blew, the fragrance of their sublime perfumes pervaded innumerable buddha realms. Countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings also held up flowers at the same time and tossed them upon the Blessed One. Similarly, countless insentient manifestations were also emanated solely through the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous powers. Through his miraculous powers, all beings’ wishes were completely fulfilled in accordance with their individual aspirations. 
$1.636 When the Blessed One arrived in the city, the entire assembly heard extraordinary and inconceivable words of instruction that rang out in the sky, no one knowing where the words came from. In this way, Dharma teachings were uttered in many hundreds of thousands of verses.
$1.637 When the Blessed One entered the city, 
These words resounded in the sky:

Were delighted, and intense faith arose in their minds.
With magnificent melodious voices, they praised Buddha
And said, “The Great Guide has come and benefitted the world!”
$1.751 When they heard those words passing from one group to another,
The gods of the Heaven of Brahmā’s Retinue joyfully exclaimed,
“The Great Guide has come and benefitted the worlds!
He scares away and frightens the armies of Māra!” [F.231.b]
$1.752 Everyone up to the gods of the Peak of Existence heard those words: 
“The Buddha has come and benefitted the world!”
As those words resounded everywhere,
The asuras decreased and the gods increased in number.
$1.753 The houses of the demons became empty,
While the retinues of gods multiplied.
Through the power of fearlessness, all beings overcame their wrong views#191
And swiftly reached supreme awakening.
$1.754 The very moment the gods heard those words,
“The Blessed One has come and benefitted the world,”
They exclaimed, “The Guide of the World is excellent!
He bestows the pure eye on sentient beings!”

Of the Blessed One’s body, his birthplace,
His family lineage, and the sound of his speech.

In accordance with the different sentient beings;
He gave eminent teachings related to the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body,
Forms, sounds, and so forth, as well as the contraction and stretching of the limbs.
$1.766 Since the Blessed One has transcended the world,
He acts as a torch within the worlds
And manifests many forms;
All these are the Buddha’s miraculous powers.#192
$1.767 He gave different teachings
To those who were suitable vessels and those who were not:#193

The pacification of views and concepts.

The absence of marks, and complete nonexistence 
Were also heard from the sky.

Related to the eye of flesh and the eye of insight,

To those who—like Śāriputra—

$1.783 Vaiśravaṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, 
And the other guardian kings
Recited the syllables of this mantra of truth 
With countless magnificent tunes.
$1.784 Those limitless tunes manifested 
Through the Blessed One’s#197 miraculous powers.
Since those miraculous powers were endless, 
The teachings, too, were endless.
$1.785 At times, through the power of those miraculous displays,
The bodies of buddhas turning the Dharma wheel—
Just as the one seen today—
Were manifested in realms devoid of a buddha.
$1.786 In an inconceivable number of realms,
He displayed countless emanations of himself
That walked seven steps right after being born,

And turned the Dharma wheel

$1.819 Through his miraculous displays, the great compassionate one 
Extensively disclosed to sentient beings
The faults associated with the eye’s exhaustion, 
And taught them the characteristics of utter peace.
$1.820 The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.
$1.821 Through his miraculous displays, the great compassionate one 
Extensively described to sentient beings

With adulthood and youth.#201
$1.822 Through his miraculous displays, the great compassionate one 
Extensively described to sentient beings

$1.831 Through his miraculous displays, the great compassionate one 
Extensively described to sentient beings

Related to one’s insight.
$1.832 The same applies to the pride related to 
Realization, miraculous powers, concentration, and erudition,
To wealth, oration, family, retinues,
Music, singing, eloquence,#202 fame, excellence, praise,
$1.833 Veneration, acquisition, beauty, deceit, 
Frivolousness, lack of modesty,
Haughtiness, accomplishment, and pride,

$1.837 Furthermore, he manifested perfumed chambers, 
Flowers, palaces,
And sublime storied mansions,
In addition to emanated buddhas who resided in them.
$1.838 He also manifested divine maidens 
Residing in mansions made of magnolia flowers;
The upper halves of their bodies were visible,
And they worshiped him by holding up garlands of flowers.
$1.839 He also manifested asura maidens#203
Residing in mansions made of jasmine flowers;
The upper halves of their bodies were visible,
And they worshiped him by holding up garlands of flowers.#204
$1.840 He also manifested gods#205
Residing in mansions made of blue lotuses;
The upper halves of their bodies were visible,
And they praised the Buddha’s qualities. 
$1.841 He also manifested gods of the Brahmā realms 
Residing in palaces made of gold;
Their entire bodies were visible,
And they praised the Buddha with their melodious voices. [F.235.b]
$1.842 There were also goddesses whose bodies
Were adorned with various ornaments,
And these beautiful words manifested
As their ornaments touched one another:
$1.843 “Though all conditioned phenomena
Are unstable and changing,
Immature beings, due to their mistaken conceptions,
Do not understand this reality as it is.”
$1.844 The words that manifested from those ornaments
Came from neither the goddesses’ bodies nor their minds;
They did not come from or go anywhere— 
They were beyond directions.
$1.845 The same should be applied to everything 
Up to forms and the mind.
Still, due to their ignorance, 
Immature beings will entertain doubts about this.
$1.846 Since the beautiful words
Manifesting from those various ornaments
Resounded in all the buddha realms,
Countless sentient beings were liberated.
$1.847 Therefore, you should regard as pure
The Guide’s body and mind—
His self-manifest wisdom
And his body endowed with boundless qualities.#206
$1.848 He has transcended craving’s proliferation,
He is disengaged and faultless,
His mind is purified and free from views,
And he is adorned with the major and minor marks.#207
$1.849 You see how when the Blessed One#208
Came to the city,
He walked like a lion,
He moved like a swan and like an elephant,
$1.850 He fulfilled the wishes of all sentient beings,
He had perfected the most exalted form of merit,
He was adorned with the authentic marks,
And all beings gazed at him insatiably.
$1.851 You see how since the supreme leader of human beings
Was endowed with great compassion,
The smallest gift offered to him 
Caused one to gain immeasurable benefits;
$1.852 For many hundreds of thousands of eons,
Until the attainment of nirvāṇa, 
The karmic ripening of those many sentient beings
Was therefore uninterrupted.
$1.853 You see how the perfect leader of human beings
Had perfected undefiled discipline,
Causing many sentient beings 
To respectfully prostrate to him,
$1.854 And how numerous divine retinues
Abandoned their palaces
And attended to the Guide,
Without any attachment to playful activities. [F.236.a]
$1.855 You see how Māra and his hordes 
Developed faith in the Blessed One,
Brought forth golden fans,
And arranged them around him.
$1.856 Five hundred māras
Tossed magnificent divine flowers#209
Onto the Thus-Gone One
And pursued unsurpassed wisdom.
$1.857 Since they had praised and worshiped
Buddhas in the past,
Each of them now became delighted
Upon meeting the Blessed One;
$1.858 They proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One
With countless eloquent words.
At that time, those māras
Were said to have abandoned cyclic existence.
$1.859 As soon as they proclaimed the praises of the Blessed One,
They understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye
And the limit of the arising of the eye,
Up to the characteristics of its utter peace.#210
$1.860 Since they had realized the boundless meanings of the eye—
The eye’s exhaustion and so forth—
They taught them to sentient beings
With skillful words.
$1.861 Since they did not cling to names and meanings
And had no doubts about them,
They realized that they do not come from or go anywhere,
And that they are beyond adoption and rejection.
$1.862 Since the nature of words is empty and void,
They realized that words are beyond 
Abandonment, adoption, retention,
Reading, recitation, and accomplishment. 
$1.863 This has also been revealed
By the thus-gone ones of the past;
Since they are mere imputations,
They are ultimately inexpressible.
$1.864 Such intrinsically empty phenomena
Transcend the aggregates, the elements, and the sense sources;
They are neither false nor true, but groundless and unsupported; 
They eliminate verbal expressions and bring thoughts to utter peace.
$1.865 Since immature beings are attached to the marks of beings,
They see the Blessed One coming to the city;
Although the Blessed One is completely beyond marks,
Those immature beings entertain mistaken thoughts.
$1.866 Those who become delighted
When the Blessed One comes to the city
Conceive of marks
And will be tormented.
$1.867 Those who have transcended conceptual marks
Will not see him coming to the city;
They will reach the insight that is free
From all concepts related to the marks of going and moving. [F.236.b]
$1.868 Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks
See him coming to the city;
They generate concepts
Related to birth and saṃsāric phenomena.
$1.869 Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks
And become delighted
Are dwelling within Māra’s domain; 
Those are the manifestations of Māra’s domain.
$1.870 Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks
See him as changing;
Since they are tormented,
They are the objects of a wise person’s pity.
$1.871 Those who view the Dharma as something to be attained
Must also worry that the Dharma will be lost.
Those who perceive the Buddha as taking birth
Experience the suffering of nirvāṇa.
$1.872 Those who have understood all marks
By training for many eons
Do not conceive of the Buddha coming to the city,
And they do not entertain the notion of nirvāṇa.
$1.873 Those who realize that the characteristics of the mind are empty
Are dwelling within the domain of the buddhas;
They do not conceive of the Buddha coming to the city,
And they do not entertain the notion of nirvāṇa.
$1.874 Those who clearly understand in that way
Will behold the buddhas
But realize that their essence is empty;
In the end, they completely transcend birth and cessation.
$1.875 After practicing austerities for countless eons, the Blessed One 
Has realized the empty essence, but immature beings do not understand this.
When the Blessed One came to the city, 
He was surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of retinues.
$1.876 Compared to the merit created by humans and nonhumans
Who make offerings with minds filled with faith,
The merit created by someone who, for a single instant, 
Contemplates the limit of the exhaustion of the eye 
$1.877 And realizes the emptiness of its marks 
Is more exalted;
No number, fraction, or illustration 
Comes close to that merit. 
$1.878 Know that the same applies
To the limit of the arising of the eye,
Its limit, and its cognition,
Up to its utter peace.
$1.879 The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,
Up to words and names.
$1.880 At that time, when the Blessed One
Came to the city, [F.237.a]
The earth started to shake
By the mere fact of his feet touching the ground.
$1.881 All the mountains
Bowed toward the Blessed One,#211
And all the gods and humans came to listen to the Dharma
And worshiped him with reverence.
$1.882 At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city, 
The lords of the gods, the kings of the humans,
Many asuras, and many yakṣas left their cities,
Gathered in front of the Blessed One, and joyfully worshiped him.
$1.883 At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,
All the countless types of birds—
Parrots, peacocks, and kalaviṅka birds—
Started to play joyfully in the sky.
$1.884 When they saw the supreme qualities 
Of the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One,
They all started to sing 
Various melodious tunes.
$1.885 When the Blessed One came to the city,
Through his miraculous powers#212
All those—among the countless hundreds of thousands of beings present— 
Who were blind regained sight, 
$1.886 All those who were deaf could hear,
All those with impaired faculties 
Recovered the full functioning of their faculties, 
And all those who were suffering became happy. 
$1.887 At that time, when the Blessed One 
Came to the city,
These words resounded
In the sky:
$1.888 “Those who conceive of the Thus-Gone One
In terms of marks cannot be said to worship the Blessed One,
And they do not realize 
The nature of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.
$1.889 “Those who abandon marks gather the basis of all qualities,#213
And so they realize the nature of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.
Since they will realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, 
They will also comprehend the buddhas’ qualities. [F.237.b]
$1.890 “With no grasping and obscuration regarding the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
With no maintaining and dwelling on the limit of the arising of the eye,
And free of thinking regarding the disengagement of the eye,
One truly sees the thus-gone ones.
$1.891 “Those who are free of thoughts regarding the limit of the arising of the eye,
Who are free of mental concepts regarding the limit of the eye,
And who do not express anything regarding the eye’s disintegration 
Truly see the thus-gone ones.
$1.892 “Those who are free of attachment regarding the nonexistence of the eye,
Free of grasping regarding the eye’s unborn nature,
And free of clinging regarding the eye’s utter peace
Truly see the thus-gone ones.
$1.893 “Since they understand the eye’s exhaustion, they actualize the marks.#214
Since they understand the limit of the eye, they ascertain the faculties. 
Since they understand the eye’s arising, they reach mastery over their faculties.
Those beings truly see the thus-gone ones.
$1.894 “Having realized the nonexistence of the eye, they comprehend forms.
Having realized the eye’s disintegration, they discern phenomena.
Having realized the eye’s unborn nature, they accomplish the path.#215
Those beings truly see the thus-gone ones.
$1.895 “Since they genuinely realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
They also understand the different types of actions,
And since they understand the different types of actions,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
$1.896 “Since they genuinely realize the limit of the arising of the eye,
They also understand the different types of suffering,
And since they understand the different types of suffering, [F.238.a]
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
$1.897 “Since they genuinely realize the eye’s disintegration,
They also realize the disintegration of suffering,
And since they realize the disintegration of suffering,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
$1.898 “Since they genuinely realize the nonexistence of the eye, 
They also realize the abandonment of characteristics,
And since they realize the abandonment of characteristics,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
$1.899 “Since they genuinely realize the unborn nature of the eye,
They also realize the abandonment of latent patterns,
And since they realize the abandonment of latent patterns,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
$1.900 “Furthermore, since they genuinely realize the nonconceptual nature of the eye,#216
They also realize the abandonment of obscurations,
And since they realize the abandonment of obscurations,
They truly see the thus-gone ones. 
$1.901 “Furthermore, since they genuinely realize that the eye is beyond words,

$1.975 At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,
Through his inconceivable miraculous powers,
The most sublime melodious voice
Manifested in the sky.
$1.976 As it revealed the various 
Activities of the dhāraṇīs,
The great assemblies present
Heard these words:
$1.977 “These dhāraṇīs cause one to realize all the ultimate modes of phenomena—
From the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, the limit of its arising,
Its limit, its disengagement, and its cognition, up to its peace.
They cause one to realize that, ultimately, everything is pure—

As well as all welfare and benefit,
Is empty, void,
And ultimately pure.
$1.981 “They do not cause one to abide or dwell
In any of the realms of existence;
Instead, they cause one to abide, disengaged,
In dhāraṇī and absorption.
$1.982 “Everything is beyond coming and going—
Not virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral.
All marks, such as those that benefit
Oneself and others, are pure.
$1.983 “Therefore, they cause one not to dwell 
On the qualities of a supreme being
Or the qualities of the hearers,
Ordinary beings, or the buddhas. 
$1.984 “They pacify all the acts related to
The limit of the exhaustion of the eye,
The limit of its arising, and its limit,

All arising, non-arising,
Suffering, happiness,
Praise, and criticism.

Within the buddhas’ miraculous powers,
And within the buddhas’ wisdom.#241
They also cause one to dwell within the power 
$1.988 “Of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,

One will cause all worldly beings,
Such as the hosts of asuras,
To abandon their rigid clinging and observe pure conduct.
$1.992 “One will delight all the countless hundreds of thousands of yakṣas
And all the countless kumbhāṇḍas;
One will also tame and delight all the innumerable 
Retinues of gandharvas and rākṣasas.
$1.993 “Even if the retinues of Brahmā
Attempted to utter their words and express their meaning 
With sublime melodious voices,
They would not be able to reveal them.
$1.994 “They cannot be fathomed
Through any mental states;
They cannot be grasped 
Through any mental states.

The fact that the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, 
The limit of its arising, its limit, and its cognition, 
Up to its peace,
$1.998 “Are devoid of self, being, 
Mind, life principle, [F.244.a]
Person, marks, action, 
Going, coming, and so forth.
$1.999 “Furthermore, they cause one to realize 
The eye of reality,
The eye accomplished on the basis of Dharma teachings,
The eye of wisdom, the eye of insight,

The eye arising from the causes of Brahmā,
The eye arising from the causes of the gods,
The eye of divine miraculous powers,

The eye of inferior births,
The eye of noble births,
The eye that relinquishes the world of the lord of death,

Up to words and names.”
$1.1010 At that moment, through the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous powers,
The Blessed One manifested in the sky [F.244.b]

Beyond all cardinal and intermediate directions,
Devoid of marks, inexpressible,
And beyond concepts.
$1.1014 “If bodhisattvas accomplish them, they will eventually attain coolness.
Even if each of their words were explained

And highly revered
By all the numerous assemblies 
That are pure and free from clinging.
$1.1016 “Through the power of the virtue 
Created by these dhāraṇīs,
Afflictions are completely overcome and pacified,#244
And the most excellent benefits#245 are gained.
$1.1017 “They lead to qualities and insight as great as a vast ocean, 
They cause one to achieve acceptance,
And they cause the mind to be at ease and unshakable.
They are always cultivated by the bodhisattvas and praised by the wise.
$1.1018 “They liberate from poverty and provide wealth and prosperity.
These dhāraṇīs increase qualities 
And cause one to be constantly adorned 
By words of truth, such as emptiness.
$1.1019 “Since they go beyond words,
They are known as empty essence.#246
Since they go beyond mind and consciousness, [F.245.a]
They are known as essence of phenomena.
$1.1020 “These dhāraṇīs always lead to stainlessness and purity.
Being grounded in genuine wisdom, 
They reveal many benefits
And generate joy and faith in many sentient beings.
$1.1021 “They bring great delight
To the countless retinues of yakṣas,
The retinues of kumbhāṇḍas,
And also the rulers of the starving spirits.
$1.1022 “These dhāraṇī mantras 
Are utterly peaceful and beyond concepts.
They cause happiness to manifest for all beings
Out of love for them. 
$1.1023 “Though they constantly remain within the realms of beings 
For hundreds of thousands of eons, 
Bringing infinite benefits,
They remain immaculate and unsullied.
$1.1024 “They bring great joy 
To countless sentient beings
By revealing the ambrosia-like Dharma
Through hundreds of thousands of verses.
$1.1025 “The countless buddhas of the past
Relied on these dhāraṇīs
With the purest trust 
And so perpetually realize reality.#247
$1.1026 “When they hear these dhāraṇīs,
The minds of Brahmā, Śakra, the gods,
The kings of the nāgas, and the asuras
Become filled with joy. 
$1.1027 “The lands where these dhāraṇī mantras are found
Remain perpetually free from harm, 
Turmoil, diseases, 
Suffering, and misery.
$1.1028 “With minds filled with joy,
All sentient beings make the aspiration
That these dhāraṇīs
Constantly remain within their minds.

Always remain connected to the body, the mind,
The palate, the mouth, and the lips,
Boundless qualities will be generated.
$1.1030 “If they are held constantly,
Countless qualities will be achieved,
Many sentient beings will benefit,
And everyone will experience joy.
$1.1031 “Since these dhāraṇī mantras
Cause one to abandon negative deeds

Will be cleared away,
Pride will be overcome,

Dhāraṇī mantras
Cause beings to realize the limits
Of exhaustion, non-exhaustion, arising, and non-arising.
$1.1036 “Since they are adorned
With those various insights,
Hundreds of thousands of thus-gone ones
Revere and worship them.
$1.1037 “These dhāraṇīs 
Produce the two feet of knowledge,#248
Place one firmly within the supreme absorption,
And cause one to follow the path to awakening;
$1.1038 “They cause one to pursue tranquility and insight
And to realize undefiled insight.
Through the strength of the faculty of deep faith,#249
They perfect the two hands.
$1.1039 “They cause one to achieve the two breasts
Through diligence and patience,
And to achieve the characteristics of the crown of the head
Through the perfection of insight. 
$1.1040 “By making a thread with those discourses 
And using it for the garland of the four individual knowledges,
One will be adorned with all the various unequaled qualities
That were accomplished in the past.
$1.1041 “Since these dhāraṇī mantras
Are endowed with countless excellent qualities,
One will realize all the gateways,
Such as the past and future limits of the eye, 
$1.1042 “The limits of its exhaustion and non-exhaustion,
Its arising and non-arising,
Its limit and non-limit,
Its engagement and disengagement,
$1.1043 “Its cognition and noncognition,
Its complete nonexistence, its absence of origination,
Its quiescence, its absence of self, its absence of person,
Its absence of life principle, and its absence of sentient being. [F.246.a]
$1.1044 “The same applies to the ear, the nose, 
The tongue, the body, the mind,
The six sense objects, and the four great elements,
Up to the names produced in the world.#250
$1.1045 “The sublime and sacred dhāraṇīs
That were praised earlier
Are endowed with the qualities of complete disengagement,
And they belong to the domain of the buddhas.
$1.1046 “Therefore, the true meaning of these dhāraṇīs
Cannot be expressed in words.
Nevertheless, to accord with worldly beings,
They have been expressed here with imputed words.” 
$1.1047 Then, together with his numerous retinues, the Blessed One arrived at the house of Candraprabhakumāra and sat down on the throne that had been prepared for him. When he saw the Blessed One sitting on the throne, Candraprabhakumārabhūta brought the most sublime offering articles and offered them to the Thus-Gone One and his great assemblies. That offering was entirely accomplished through his inconceivable power and the roots of virtue generated by his extraordinary concentration, absorption, and concentration qualities. Since he made that offering not only for himself but in order for all the countless sentient beings to strive for awakening and achieve great benefits, that act of worship was all-pervasive and satisfied everyone.
$1.1048 When the Blessed One had finished his lunch, he said these words to Candraprabhakumārabhūta in front of the numerous retinues: “Kumāra, if noble sons or daughters who follow the Great Vehicle accomplish the accumulation of generosity, they will be endowed with eighty types of eminent qualities.#251 What are those eighty? (1) They will ripen sentient beings and attract them with pleasant words. (2) They will perfect the excellent marks. [F.246.b] (3) All their faculties will be complete. (4) They will abandon saṃsāra and actualize nirvāṇa. (5) Their afflictions will be exhausted and they will achieve supreme might. (6) They will be adorned with perfect qualities and buddha realms. (7) Their retinues will be pure. (8) They will be endowed with great majesty. (9) They will be endowed with perfect insight. (10) They will accomplish the most eminent activities.

(13) Their bodies and relics will be worshiped by all worldly beings, hearers, and solitary buddhas.
